1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:07,220
wanted to take a few moments and

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,980
introduce ray Davidson I once again I've

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,260
known ray forever another person who's

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,110
number one goal in security for a long

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,698
long long time has been just basically

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,279
trying to get the information out and

7
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:23,749
trying to share education with as many

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,970
people as possible and ray it's hard for

9
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:28,488
me I think ray I've known you probably

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,890
for the better part of a decade now at

11
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:33,770
Sands conferences and working with sands

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,330
and in your new position just fantastic

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,970
it was a little bit weird because when

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:41,060
he got his PhD he insisted on all of us

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,489
calling him dr. ray Davidson that was a

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,400
bit awkward other weird things about Ray

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,140
all right so ray and I years ago we were

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,720
talking about its Digital Millennium

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,220
Copyright Act and ways to get around the

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,640
Digital Millennium Copyright Act and

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:59,450
whether or not if Ray gave me his music

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,060
if it was a violation of the Digital

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:05,269
Millennium Copyright Act if I kept his

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,479
music for exclusive exclusive backup

25
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:11,240
purposes and with good backup strategies

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,609
and backup thing and then you can test

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,339
it regularly so I got this hard drive of

28
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:18,559
Ray's just amazing music collection and

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,240
I still have the backups ray I haven't

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,759
charged you for the backups of your

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,119
music collection nor well I but I

32
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:29,389
periodically test it for integrity that

33
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,819
was that was a little through nighters

34
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,899
had totally forgotten that done yeah I

35
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:35,420
still have the hard drive around here

36
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,399
somewhere dude I absolutely do just one

37
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,770
of the funnest people to hang out with I

38
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,659
haven't seen him in a while at Sands

39
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,039
conferences and stuff but and then even

40
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:45,679
at like our conferences when he shows up

41
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,509
I'm so busy he's so busy I kind of miss

42
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:49,100
you know like eight years ago we just go

43
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:51,499
out for sushi and go out for dinner in

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,669
Vegas but we'll get back to that as soon

45
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:58,520
as possible I supposed to have dinner

46
00:01:52,670 --> 00:02:00,529
with you this week yes I know for us so

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,199
without further ado ray is gonna talk

48
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:06,259
about doing justice and leaving cyber

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,179
skills groups make the world a better

50
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,790
place so take it away

51
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,209
hi folks I and let me say also that

52
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,578
that's a complete lie about the the

53
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,560
doctor thing it really kind of bugs me

54
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:23,219
when people call me doc there are other

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,430
people that would be that I know that's

56
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:30,650
why I said that yes your John is trying

57
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,769
to embarrass me and but it's not working

58
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,689
so I hope you can see my main screen and

59
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:37,939
not my notes because then you'll all

60
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:40,790
laugh at my jokes before I tell them and

61
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:43,159
and I won't even know I do have discord

62
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,709
running but it's on a different screen

63
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,409
so if you have questions and things put

64
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,680
them in there you might put my name with

65
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,970
the question and I will answer them I

66
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,909
need to start with a disclaimer that

67
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,670
this is the Michigan cyber civilian core

68
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,739
it's an official arm of the state of

69
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,809
Michigan but I am NOT an official of the

70
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:05,209
government of the state of Michigan all

71
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,590
the information about the mi c3 which is

72
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,319
what we call the Michigan cyber civility

73
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,000
core is is true to the best of my

74
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,429
knowledge but there's some personal

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,680
stuff in here that I hope it wouldn't

76
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,780
embarrass my boss but it's it's not

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,950
relevant for the cyber civilian core

78
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,250
because it took me a while to get

79
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,379
through where I am the Michigan cyber

80
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,769
civilian core is a great outlet for

81
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:30,319
somebody with some cyber skills and a

82
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,569
hankering to serve the public I was just

83
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,000
listening to Johnny long his talk so

84
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,010
it's a it sort of along the same lines

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,190
people that want to do good you can see

86
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:43,730
in my in discord I'm the old hippie

87
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,829
do-gooder so this is my thing we are the

88
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,198
only state sponsor group of civilian

89
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:49,909
incident responders in the country I'll

90
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:52,489
tell you about that but it's worth

91
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:55,340
giving some context we are not a bunch

92
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,989
of super elite hacks or like the other

93
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,319
people that are on the stage and in fact

94
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,540
I'm a little bit overwhelmed at the

95
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,119
company I'm joining you don't have to be

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,429
a rockstar like John or Mike or or J

97
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,859
Hamm or at scooters or Larry Pesci or

98
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,049
any of these German Junkin all those

99
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,479
people that I left out make a difference

100
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:17,959
there is just a whole lot of work to do

101
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,519
the bar is low or helping people out and

102
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,610
I thin again that was one of the things

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,530
that Johnny was talking about so with

104
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,599
the Michigan cyber civility core I'm a

105
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,630
member and I thought it would be useful

106
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:31,520
to give you a sample history of one of

107
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,150
the members in my own history is the one

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,359
that I know the best I have been been

109
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,400
around or over a decade in various roles

110
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,889
around the

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,239
sans peripheral community or I know

112
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:47,750
they're people that knew that our

113
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,520
InfoSec I've seen in the new attendees a

114
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,430
bunch of students which i think is

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,080
awesome I used to be a professor and

116
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,479
sometimes I get asked how to get into

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,650
InfoSec so I wanted to give an example

118
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:04,070
of maybe not what you wanted to do but I

119
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,620
did have a very very good plan first of

120
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,630
all though since I did a lot of inside

121
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,600
baseball in my abstract if anybody

122
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,370
actually read my my Abstract this is it

123
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,650
and I realized

124
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,750
Elda asked me if I would if I would

125
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,780
speak and I just I was so excited I just

126
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,400
flipped us off and neglected to think

127
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,750
about that people might not know what I

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,549
was talking about so the first about net

129
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,010
Catskills and Swiss Army knife there

130
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,870
used to be a thing where the the

131
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,940
challenge at the bar was to be able to

132
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,460
describe netcat without using a phrase

133
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,110
with army knife and I suppose if you

134
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,520
could do it you'd get a drink or

135
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,740
something like that but my skill my

136
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,109
netcat skills are closer to the butter

137
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,330
knife and Swiss Army knife or not it's

138
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,510
kotas and you know consuming that cat

139
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,510
without

140
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:57,270
the second one is Mike war always says

141
00:05:52,280 --> 00:06:01,200
see the packet yield a packet be the

142
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,380
packet and part of being the packet is

143
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,810
knowing about it masking and it's a

144
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,400
requirement that you hydrate before

145
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,710
asking and I'm not going to tell that

146
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,479
story of Mike's but I always remember it

147
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:16,229
whenever I do any bit masking I take a

148
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,150
sip of water and CTS I am totally

149
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,130
horrible at capture the flags I love

150
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,530
doing them because I get through maybe

151
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,240
the five the first five questions or

152
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,799
maybe the first level because I've

153
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,800
always got to figure out what all wrong

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,139
it and I'm sure some of you who are

155
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,120
analysts have gotten over that

156
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,919
because it's it's endless disease you

157
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,740
know want to know every possible wrong

158
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,818
answer in addition to the right ones so

159
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,129
I was I I tried for a long time - well

160
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,349
no I didn't even really try be like

161
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:49,389
super good but it was a little

162
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:52,300
depressing for a while to know that I

163
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:54,520
was never gonna be Larry or adder or any

164
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,729
of those guys but the thing that I'm

165
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,498
doing now is is a pretty cool thing like

166
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:01,930
it says there I seriously I have the

167
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:03,069
coolest job in the world and not the

168
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,780
first time I've been able to do stuff

169
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:08,410
like this

170
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,419
this is my 50-year plan into InfoSec and

171
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,150
it literally took me about that long

172
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,980
that tells you my age I have not

173
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,599
actually listened to the webcasts that

174
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,730
are here but if you don't like the

175
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,919
50-year plan I can refer you to a couple

176
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:24,100
of five public webcast about five-year

177
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,289
plans and so really this is the negative

178
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,560
example of go listen to John's for the

179
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,510
positive example

180
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,210
it's not like I've got things that are

181
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,580
kind of gonna come up here InfoSec is an

182
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,409
applied subject oh I mean I love doing

183
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,020
the package and things like that but

184
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:43,050
it's it's something that applies to

185
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,930
people and without reference to a

186
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,230
population at least now that we're up

187
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,400
above level 2 and level 3

188
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,560
vulnerabilities no more packaging stuff

189
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,150
it's about people and if you want to be

190
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,730
effective at security you have to meet

191
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,549
you have to understand how technology is

192
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:02,220
used in the population one of the things

193
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,200
that I often say is that if secure if

194
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,360
the security department is the

195
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,580
department of no you become the

196
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,960
department of don't know because people

197
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,400
go around you but if you want to

198
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,530
actually accomplish security in a

199
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,349
population you have to know how people

200
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,299
behave

201
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,910
when I was growing up there was not a

202
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,390
lot of today's technology around and

203
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:25,220
there was no real InfoSec as we know

204
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,840
there were not even really computers I

205
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,150
don't think I was gonna look up when

206
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,030
NASA was started but I don't think there

207
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,010
were even the female computers at NASA

208
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:36,260
when I was coming up so when I wanted to

209
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,909
first get her job it was tough you had

210
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,710
to have a work permit if you wanted to

211
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:43,219
do anything interesting and I was in

212
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,960
school I was 14 when I got my first jobs

213
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,200
the first thing I did was to get paper

214
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,190
route

215
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:53,370
and for anybody that has had an old

216
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,740
paper route you this was not papyrus now

217
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,060
it was newsprint every customer on the

218
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,640
rat one of the things you have to do is

219
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,849
to do record-keeping right and every

220
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,319
customer on the route was represented or

221
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,180
their account was represented by a

222
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,430
single piece of paper where you would

223
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,290
note down when you collected money from

224
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,140
and all these pieces of paper were

225
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,849
collected and a spring-loaded binder was

226
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,970
called the wrapper

227
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,500
and so I went down to the paper company

228
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,880
and I applied for a paper route they

229
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,009
said okay you can have this route I

230
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,290
forget what the number was but there was

231
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:27,750
it came free because somebody was giving

232
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:31,319
up their route so the old paperboy gave

233
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,149
me his route look look over I wasn't

234
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:35,279
really sure exactly why it was bunch of

235
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,009
paper but he told me to bring it the

236
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,889
next day and he would show me the ropes

237
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:43,799
when the doing the route

238
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:45,929
so I took the route home and I looked at

239
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,660
it and there were there were pieces of

240
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:50,279
paper that was different colors for the

241
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,019
subscriptions like if it was seven days

242
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,790
a week that would be one color and if it

243
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,319
was two days a week you know weekends

244
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,108
only there was another color and that

245
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:59,579
sort of thing so I looked at the bend at

246
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:02,010
the bottom it had the name and address

247
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:05,219
of the subscriber

248
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,569
and I looked at those and I looked

249
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,570
through this book and I just could not

250
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:13,020
see any order at all to it it looked

251
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,970
like the guy had every time you got a

252
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,540
new subscriber he just added the paper

253
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:21,570
at the end of the book but I thought oh

254
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,060
this is really terrible but I'm really

255
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:27,240
smart and so I'm gonna fix this

256
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,040
so I took it home and I don't remember

257
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,970
exactly how I organized it I used

258
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,150
whatever was my my organizational

259
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,710
paradigm that I had and it was either I

260
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,790
don't think it was alphabetically

261
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,920
because that would have been too much

262
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,959
but I think probably I took it like

263
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,550
by-street maybe I did the streets

264
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,880
alphabetical and then the address is

265
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,729
numerical right so so I showed up the

266
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,930
next day with my cleaned up version of

267
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,970
the route book thinking they were going

268
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,910
to think this was this was awesome and

269
00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:00,420
they there it was him and his mom and

270
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,709
their jaws dropped like what the my

271
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,969
goodness did you do

272
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:08,100
and they really quick grabbed it and

273
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,870
reorganized it back into some rent this

274
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,300
random way that had been organized

275
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,790
turned out that the pages were ordered

276
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,969
in the order that you come to them on

277
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,890
the route so sometimes the odd you'd

278
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,180
have all of the odd numbers in a row

279
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,960
because that's the side of the street

280
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:27,750
we're walking down I wrote a bicycle had

281
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,220
those bicycles and then you cross over

282
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,800
you do the other side of the street and

283
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:35,220
it was it was like hardly bear see

284
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:39,390
because they looked at me like I I was

285
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,680
an idiot and but you know there's my

286
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,390
paper route so and then we're gonna go

287
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,689
away anybody that I'd never see them

288
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,630
again

289
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,540
so so I got over it so the lesson here

290
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:52,860
is to learn that technology is used for

291
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,680
people and it's often set up to serve

292
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,050
the user

293
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,359
as though my first introduction to the

294
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,339
concept of databases or Kevin Johnson I

295
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,260
know that likes to tried to start a

296
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,580
trend of calling databases cylinders

297
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,460
because that's how they're represented

298
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,770
on the Visio diagram databases you know

299
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,050
have methods for putting stuff in and

300
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,480
getting stuff out and I was thinking in

301
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,069
terms of the reporting because I got a

302
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,290
paper out to make money so I wanted to

303
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:21,050
be able to read my accounts that's sort

304
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:25,430
of thing so that's what I was thinking

305
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:27,949
of now I I knew differently once I would

306
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,949
get my own job without a work permit I

307
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,830
went to work for the phone company and

308
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:36,050
not the standard entry job for phone

309
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,540
company was a linesman and I was it I

310
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,660
was like 16 years old but they did have

311
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,060
information operator openings so I was

312
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,649
an information operator for a while we

313
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,709
went through a change while I was there

314
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:51,740
that we didn't say information it was

315
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:53,959
directory assistance and when I was

316
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,740
there they changed to start saying for

317
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:57,890
your records

318
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,930
the name is the number is blah blah blah

319
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,490
and people some people got a little

320
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,180
annoyed at that like they were gonna

321
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:07,610
have to write stuff down so so that was

322
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:11,329
interesting I was the only male in that

323
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,490
group I also managed to change the dress

324
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,620
code at my high school we had a I went

325
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:19,130
to Catholic High School and they had a

326
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:22,180
hair like hood and it won't surprise you

327
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:24,439
to know that I tested the limits of that

328
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,779
more than once I guess it's fitted four

329
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,150
times my senior year my dad was not

330
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:31,670
happy but because I had this paper route

331
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,449
and had a little money the last time I

332
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,630
got suspended

333
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,190
I went there's a wig store in the local

334
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,170
shopping center so I got him just fit me

335
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,959
a wig and I went back to school of the

336
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,510
short hair wig which was cool except

337
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:47,209
that I had to wear the short hair wig

338
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,850
for the rest of the year and it was hot

339
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:51,709
and that that is my senior picture I

340
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,270
tried to find a copy of it and I

341
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:54,529
couldn't but you know it's the dorky

342
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:58,460
high school picture I'm not sure you

343
00:13:54,529 --> 00:14:01,670
hotel so again

344
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,940
it's dealing with people right so I went

345
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,459
to college and there was no computer

346
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,400
science that even at Georgia Tech there

347
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,250
was no computer science when I started

348
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:16,010
it they started up a school of computer

349
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,870
science and by the time I think it was

350
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:21,350
probably a sophomore or junior we took

351
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:23,990
Fortran and it was the old thing that

352
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,180
old people talk about where you draw the

353
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,400
line across the cards and you have to be

354
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,439
careful not to drop your box of cards as

355
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,020
you take computer center because they

356
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,440
fall you know you do a forty thousand

357
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,600
card pickup you drop them on the floor

358
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,250
did work have some interesting

359
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,870
experiences I ran the backstage at the

360
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,910
fabulous Fox Theater if you've ever been

361
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,950
to Atlanta's cool place and I did a

362
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:49,520
bunch of other stuff that I'm not gonna

363
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,490
record but I when I got my degree I

364
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,420
really didn't want to go to work and

365
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,120
there's some people that will tell you

366
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,810
that that hasn't changed very much so I

367
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,950
got into graduate school at Purdue and

368
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,819
again I learned a lot of interesting

369
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,800
stuff

370
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,990
some of it was Chemical Engineering I

371
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,790
took a couple of years worth of French

372
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,760
and Philosophy and I had a mentor who

373
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,199
was like a real-life theologian who had

374
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,390
studied in Europe and seeing the Dead

375
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,750
Sea Scrolls and written a whole bunch of

376
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:20,240
stuff so I learned a bunch of theology

377
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:22,270
and and that was cool I worked on for

378
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,370
work I worked on an artificial kidney

379
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,860
we studied blood clotting on artificial

380
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,970
surfaces which is a which is a problem

381
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,440
if you don't want it to happen I mean

382
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:34,550
it's really good thing for blood to clot

383
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,280
but if you're putting it through like a

384
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,719
an artificial kidney dialysis machine

385
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,560
heart-lung machine or anything you built

386
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,990
blood clotting is a bad thing

387
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,699
1982 Purdue got connected to the

388
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,970
Internet the back when Al Gore invented

389
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,950
the internet you know and we didn't

390
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,750
graduate schools graduate students

391
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,710
didn't get training we just saw these

392
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,350
3270 terminals show up around the campus

393
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,120
and we had the summer to play with them

394
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,430
before the undergraduates got back but

395
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,010
the undergraduates got training they had

396
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,939
classes so I read I must have read

397
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,560
thousands of pages of man pages and

398
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,050
probably killed several forests burning

399
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,329
them out to read them but I thought this

400
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,180
would be a cool thing because I had

401
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,620
gotten my master's thesis type that was

402
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,589
the deal you had to have it typed on

403
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:27,230
like 100% cotton paper or something like

404
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:29,690
that it costs me like between 150 and

405
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,820
200 dollars and that was like bill money

406
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,970
back then before the turn of the century

407
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,310
and with the advent of the computer

408
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,130
system I could like type that myself so

409
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,739
I learned an Roffe and tear off and soon

410
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,779
some equation setting and I'm probably

411
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,780
saying it wrong to somebody I'm sure

412
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:50,540
older than I am and correcting me but I

413
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:53,180
but I did type up my my thesis and I

414
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,459
learned the UNIX shell there was no bash

415
00:16:53,180 --> 00:17:00,530
back then there wasn't even CSH it was

416
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:02,630
all Sh so about that and again you'll

417
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,869
notice the years there I was at Purdue

418
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,819
for seven years and again so I caused a

419
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:12,250
policy change there's now a limit of how

420
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,250
long you can be in graduate school

421
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:18,850
are graduated and this was a this was a

422
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,639
15 year detour it was not really helpful

423
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:23,708
for my or my information security career

424
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,289
so if you're looking at this to make

425
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:29,500
your own plan you might be able to cut

426
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:32,140
it down to 35 years from 50 here but I

427
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,540
did have

428
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,760
interesting experiences I first started

429
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,120
at a company called syntax in Palo Alto

430
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,950
syntax was one of the first companies it

431
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,320
was the first company to invent the oral

432
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,450
contraceptive so they have the

433
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,970
distinction of inventing or being part

434
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,440
of inventing the sexual revolution so

435
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,710
you can love me or hate me for that I

436
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,940
did not work on that project I worked on

437
00:17:52,710 --> 00:18:00,720
cardiovascular and you aurillac

438
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,970
which is one of the drugs that is

439
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,030
related to opioids we were doing

440
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,700
transdermal delivery

441
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:10,310
it was a cool place to be Xerox PARC the

442
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,100
a lotto Research Center where a lot of

443
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,830
windows and mouse stuff was invented

444
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,540
they were just across the street and

445
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,790
Steve Jobs had started next computer

446
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,320
next computer was just like two miles

447
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,590
down the road around the corner and

448
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:28,939
that's not a city block where this is

449
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:30,889
it's just gorgeous countryside oh I miss

450
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,020
being out there except for the cost of

451
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,370
living it was terrible

452
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,590
I wouldn't have been able to buy a house

453
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,770
and have few kids by then so I moved to

454
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:42,409
the Midwest and now I live in Kalamazoo

455
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:45,830
Michigan they lived here ever since 1989

456
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:48,140
and it's been awesome except for or it's

457
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,840
you know it's not quite as exciting as

458
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,030
living in Silicon Valley but I work for

459
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:57,620
the Upjohn company which doesn't exist

460
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:59,120
anymore he got merged with Swiss Italian

461
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,429
company Co pharmacia and then we got

462
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,860
bought out by Pfizer but during this

463
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,350
period of time there was any anybody

464
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,419
works in a large organization knows the

465
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,090
routine of the pendulum that swings from

466
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:15,080
shadow I teach a corporate IT and I

467
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:17,959
spent a lot of time in the lab and the

468
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,000
thing about pharmaceutical research is

469
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,860
that if you have a product it has to be

470
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,050
stable for two years on the shelf

471
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,520
because no telling how long it's going

472
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,740
to be from the time you manufacture it

473
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,000
you ship it across the country it may or

474
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,490
may not be under control temperature

475
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,900
conditions and you want people to be

476
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,730
able to buy it and have it on their

477
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,600
shelf for a certain period of time in

478
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,190
the and the standard is two years so the

479
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,230
way you determine if the compound is

480
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,910
stable for two years as you stick it up

481
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,160
on the shelf in USA that every once in a

482
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:49,220
while over a course of two years well

483
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,770
that's that's not very exciting and it

484
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:55,820
certainly wasn't exciting for me but the

485
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:57,770
pendulum swang and we had a new CIO who

486
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,350
consolidated all the shadow IT into

487
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,450
corporate IT and I applied for the job

488
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,100
of being on the interface between R&D

489
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,990
and IT I could spell them both when I

490
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,980
figured I got something to offer both

491
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:13,460
ways and it was not too long before the

492
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,620
y2k Romanian remediation project so I

493
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,910
got put in charge of that fortunately

494
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,919
for me there were people that knew what

495
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,380
they were doing and they kind of held my

496
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,510
told me to write this here and go tell

497
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,840
the boss that so they won't bother us

498
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:29,210
and I was a good manager and did what I

499
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,740
was told

500
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,659
worked well enough and we there were

501
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,940
some other changes within the

502
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:37,820
organization and then I got this bigger

503
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,890
project - it was involved with

504
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,730
increasing control of the environment

505
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:46,130
after the mergers one of the big four

506
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:50,179
consulting companies had come to Advisor

507
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:52,220
and said what you have too much lack of

508
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:54,559
yet you got too many sites everybody has

509
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,360
different privileges but you need to get

510
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,139
more control of your IT environment and

511
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,539
you can reduce IT support costs if you

512
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,190
will standardize the desktop environment

513
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:06,860
and too many people have admin

514
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,120
privileges but like because 100 people

515
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,918
hundred percent of people had admin

516
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,928
privilege they didn't even think of

517
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,880
taking them away back then I know this

518
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:18,500
is causing some of you to be apoplectic

519
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,870
but that's that's the way it was me

520
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,520
welcoming myself to the webinar we had

521
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,889
they had this project they convinced

522
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,740
people that in this managers that if

523
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:31,309
they removed admin privileges from 50%

524
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,710
of the population then they could even

525
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,678
though it might cause more desktop

526
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:39,080
support all's you could you could have a

527
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,090
remote access this is not a remote

528
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,580
access trojan this was a good remote

529
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,750
access application you could you

530
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,939
wouldn't have to essentially roll a

531
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,039
truck or it sends somebody out in person

532
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,539
so you could reduce costs so they

533
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,210
started this project friend of mine was

534
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:56,029
running it and he got promoted and he

535
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,649
asked a different friend of ours if that

536
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:00,169
friend would do it net friend said no

537
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:02,260
way I'm not touching this with a and

538
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:04,970
foot Paul erased it but he'll do it and

539
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:08,450
so they came to me and they said will

540
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:10,490
you take this and I said I I liked the

541
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,799
idea because by this time I've gotten

542
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:16,070
some exposure to the security also it

543
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,620
wasn't just about losing cost but think

544
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,059
about this now if you're gonna

545
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,489
you have a population of people and

546
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:25,040
you're gonna take 50% take privileges

547
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:28,340
away from 50% of them who's gonna be

548
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,080
happy they're like nobody is the people

549
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,659
that the people that still have

550
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,889
privileges are gonna be hiding them or

551
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,390
they're gonna try and help their friends

552
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,580
everybody's gonna know somebody that has

553
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,860
that and privileges and so they're gonna

554
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,570
think that other guy he's for girl did

555
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,159
you know they're no better than I am I

556
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,520
should have that privilege to why this

557
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,190
is unfair so I might counter often for

558
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,320
taking the project was I'll do it but

559
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,690
we're going to reduce admin privilege

560
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,939
it's the minimum possible and we we

561
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,730
negotiated down to 10% because that was

562
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,370
probably the number of developer people

563
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:04,970
that needed development privileges in in

564
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:07,010
global R&D and I also got them to say

565
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:10,040
look we need to we need to monitor this

566
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,720
because it's a negative making away

567
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,550
admin privileges is a negative for

568
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,470
people and so they have they may get

569
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,139
pissed off and we need to know if that's

570
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,630
happening this was before I was in any

571
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:25,100
way exposed to sans but I was already on

572
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:28,040
the evaluation bandwagon so we said the

573
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:31,689
customer satisfaction had to be no less

574
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,450
than 85% and I got them to agree that

575
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:37,910
essentially doesn't suck is the positive

576
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,620
so and we did make that it took about a

577
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,200
year and a half we replaced did a

578
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,840
forklift upgrade of all the machines

579
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,600
took them away at night repopulated them

580
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,419
with their applications overnight

581
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,059
delivered in the next morning and I had

582
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,840
everybody fill out an eval and we did in

583
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:57,860
fact at 85 percent customer satisfaction

584
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,070
85 percent of people said it wasn't

585
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:03,320
worse than they expected and went

586
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,330
forward so that was really when I

587
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,159
started feeling like I got it about

588
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,260
something people listen to me because I

589
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,160
had under some understanding about how

590
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,580
people behave

591
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,830
there was one drawback the standard

592
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:19,990
desktop it was all Microsoft so it was

593
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,990
office 2000 I think and

594
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,600
build included an mp3 player I forget

595
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,090
Microsoft Media Player Windows Media

596
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,070
Player or something like that but iTunes

597
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,810
was was coming out everybody thought

598
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:35,960
iTunes was the hot new thing there was

599
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:37,909
an iTunes version for Windows but

600
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,100
the project leader I'm thinking we have

601
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,730
that capability you play mp3s with

602
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:47,480
Windows Media Player so unless somebody

603
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:49,400
tells me we need iTunes we have the

604
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,500
capability right business requirement is

605
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,630
met don't give me the technical

606
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,330
specifications that's not your job

607
00:24:53,630 --> 00:25:02,000
well finally there was this VP who

608
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:03,350
decided that he really wanted iTunes and

609
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,170
he called me in his office and closed

610
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:08,060
the door and he said that iTunes was

611
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,160
going to be part of the standard SI bill

612
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,020
he wasn't going to sign anything to

613
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,810
explain why was an exception it was just

614
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,879
going to happen and I said okay and so

615
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,100
iTunes became part of that standard

616
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,490
desktop but you know that was the only

617
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:26,120
drawback I also had during that period

618
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:29,210
of time I was introduced to sands I took

619
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:32,090
what was then track 1 it's the precursor

620
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,250
to 401 when you took that it was in out

621
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:39,020
in San Francisco and it was from Bob

622
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,250
Hillary and it was I had a study to to

623
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,230
learn about networking and network

624
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,450
addressing and things like that before I

625
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,360
took the class but it was the beginning

626
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:50,210
of my love affair with packets not to

627
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,850
mention like war so of course that was

628
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:55,130
when I lost my job I got a reasonable

629
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,959
severance which was nice of spectrum

630
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,120
companies did severance I had worked for

631
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,130
18 years for the company I got about a

632
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,879
year salary to help with retraining and

633
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,950
reemployment but I was at this point I

634
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,080
was 50 years old I was an unemployed

635
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:12,110
middle-aged man with four kids high

636
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,000
school and college age and no real

637
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,760
skills I couldn't go back and do

638
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,880
Chemical Engineering again I did briefly

639
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,160
contemplate becoming a project manager

640
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,010
because I've done some things like that

641
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,600
but I also saw the project managers that

642
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,960
we had around Pfizer and they got

643
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,240
parachuted into the middle of a mess and

644
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,190
everybody hated them and I just couldn't

645
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,010
even even though they made really good

646
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:40,730
money that wasn't for me so I took my

647
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:43,310
severance and I looked around for ways

648
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:47,600
to get back to that that magic I had

649
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:49,340
taken for the 401 us and I decided I

650
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,830
wanted more of that I found out about

651
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,439
work-study which some of you have seen

652
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:57,770
in the disc or chat if you want to do

653
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,140
sans courses at less than $7000

654
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:03,590
work-study is the way to do it it was

655
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:07,970
only $500 at the time I did my first one

656
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:12,080
in Chicago in 2007 with Jonathan Hannah

657
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:14,790
who also spoke yesterday it was

658
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,939
4:14 which he mentioned in his talk

659
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:20,790
it is solo crushing as he said it's a

660
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,710
really long day there's no labs and at

661
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,960
that time I already had my see houses P

662
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,870
but I was really interested in getting

663
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,270
involved with sand so so I did it all

664
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:35,010
told I probably did 18 or 20 conferences

665
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:38,160
and I got about a dozen certs but I can

666
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:40,320
say for certain that just like a PhD

667
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,510
asking a certain does not mean you're

668
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,230
competent or confident sit down and

669
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:48,030
start doing that for her career so after

670
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,950
about a year and a half my severance

671
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:52,020
money was running out I had a bunch of

672
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,910
certs no real experience and no

673
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,250
connections and InfoSec be on sans

674
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,830
really I was hanging out with people

675
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,120
like John and Mike and Ed but they you

676
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,590
know they weren't giving me a paycheck

677
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,459
and Sam's wasn't giving me a paycheck

678
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:07,080
either I was paying to do stuff but then

679
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,360
one of those things that makes you

680
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,909
realize that you're not really in

681
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,600
control of your life it was a guy named

682
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,100
Sam Stan wiles who had seen my Twitter

683
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,850
beat and knew that I knew something

684
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,949
about network security and from my

685
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,449
trainee and you know this is academic so

686
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,070
I didn't actually have to perform right

687
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:30,220
I could teach

688
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,080
it purdue's Hammond campus this was the

689
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,360
Calumet campus they were trying to get

690
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,059
accredited and they needed PhDs on their

691
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,469
on their faculty and he reached out to

692
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:42,340
me to see if I'd be interested this is

693
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:44,740
like two hours away it was not a picnic

694
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,480
by any means I did this for two years I

695
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,880
would drive over on Sunday afternoon and

696
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,309
be back on Thursday evening after class

697
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,100
and I would stay at the Red Roof Inn

698
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:56,559
during the week and that was before I

699
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:00,370
had my dog so it was I was all all alone

700
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,860
and it just it's not a bad it's not a

701
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:05,199
great thing for your mental health but I

702
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:08,258
learned a lot I certainly learned the

703
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,490
stuff that I was teaching learned a lot

704
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:16,289
about networking and low-level packets

705
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,289
and and signaling

706
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,340
students that stay in touch in fact I

707
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,159
have one student who was going to show

708
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,889
up in San Diego in person he was the guy

709
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,490
who saved his summer internship money

710
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:31,410
into the OS CP it had to take it twice

711
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,809
take the test twice but he got it over

712
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:36,960
the summer I'm so incredibly proud of

713
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:39,000
him but I don't even have the USC and

714
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,590
he's not working for Verizon those are

715
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,720
the those are the things that are great

716
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,270
but as I say it was bad for my mental

717
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,090
health finally had an epiphany that I

718
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,770
won't talk too much about here but let

719
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,540
me just say that if you have to ask

720
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,889
yourself if you ever wonder if you have

721
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,409
a problem with alcohol you've already

722
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,750
answered your question so I went through

723
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:01,350
some recovery there I learned a little

724
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:03,780
bit about well basically you know when

725
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:06,330
when people can't follow a policy you

726
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:09,629
need to install a physical or technical

727
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:12,149
control and if you go and try to find

728
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,040
out how to put a what they call a blow

729
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,620
and go or an ignition interlock in your

730
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,899
car to keep you from contravening policy

731
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,928
it's not trivial to do I figure out how

732
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,250
to do that and I I got introduced to a

733
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:26,070
section of town that I was not

734
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,170
previously aware of but where real men

735
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:32,010
work on real transmissions and they Rev

736
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:33,510
they're real modified engines but but I

737
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,309
I went through that I got a really good

738
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,710
attorney I learned a lot about the legal

739
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:39,570
process we actually changed some some

740
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,720
things together he used me as an example

741
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,850
so long story not going to go more into

742
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,580
that but I'm happy to talk about it if

743
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,649
anybody cares but it was around this

744
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,379
time in another unexpected development I

745
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:54,360
got a phone call from a guy named Steven

746
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,030
Northcutt Steven some of you know he's

747
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,120
the president of sands he had always

748
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:02,809
wanted to do something academic with

749
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,659
Sanz and he had gotten the go-ahead to

750
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:07,550
build a master's program

751
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,100
and he knew I had some academic

752
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:11,570
experience and again that's letter Sania

753
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,879
at the end of my name we're gonna be

754
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,620
useful for accreditation and that sort

755
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,750
of stuff he was really looking for a

756
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,270
right-hand person to help with that and

757
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:24,110
my gosh you know Stephen North got calls

758
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,950
you he you just you go we created the

759
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:28,520
master's program

760
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,440
it got accredited and this knows people

761
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,820
in the audience or probably in the

762
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,850
audience who have benefitted from that

763
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,399
which I'm really happy about it turned

764
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,980
out that as the after accreditation

765
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,750
happened that we were hands and I were

766
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:45,500
not really on the same page about the

767
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:47,210
vision or it which is fine i well i

768
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,280
really want one of John's t-shirts

769
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,310
Bradley sucking you capitalism that

770
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,250
tells you anything so we parted ways

771
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,830
amicably

772
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:59,170
so again I was unemployed this is a bit

773
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:03,610
like a 10-year period of underemployment

774
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:05,500
and our limited employment so I was on

775
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,510
unemployment for a little bit and I

776
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,000
heard of this this group called the

777
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,700
Michigan cyber civilian Corps and just

778
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,780
like when I was looking around for ways

779
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:18,460
to get exposed to InfoSec this seemed

780
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:22,120
like a way I could kind of keep my hand

781
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:24,550
in so I signed up to be a volunteer but

782
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:29,020
what is this Michigan cyber civilian

783
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:31,540
Corps it is and was then the only state

784
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:34,900
sponder state-sponsored all-volunteer

785
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,520
force of cyber defenders other states

786
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,970
that are interested in I'm on the phone

787
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:42,040
every week or two with somebody who's

788
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,530
calling trying to find out how would you

789
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:47,649
what we do and what what we've done to

790
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:49,540
get here currently we have about a

791
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,850
hundred information security

792
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,830
professionals who volunteered all across

793
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,929
the state of Michigan and if you go look

794
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,120
at the map of Michigan there's an

795
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,650
interstate that runs between roughly

796
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,810
between Detroit and Chicago

797
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,790
it's a high concentration of people

798
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,740
along that east-west corridor you've got

799
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,300
a built-in map of Michigan and there's

800
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,400
an Upper Peninsula I think we have three

801
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,190
people in the Upper Peninsula and I'm

802
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,500
trying to expand membership North but

803
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,780
it's hard to find members outside of the

804
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,120
population centers the original design

805
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,520
was that we would respond in the event

806
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,760
of a governor declared cyber emergency

807
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,100
talk about that in a minute but we that

808
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,260
that's a pretty high bar and there's a

809
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,149
lot of reasons why that's not practical

810
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,420
in terms of keeping an organization

811
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:38,380
going so we worked with the legislature

812
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:40,510
and got a law passed public Act 132 of

813
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,660
2017 which is the Michigan cyber

814
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,700
civilian Act which provides some put

815
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:49,270
some boundaries around what we can do

816
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,490
and rights oversight to the legislative

817
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:53,170
committee and fortunately for me I don't

818
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,450
have to do that I'm really lucky that

819
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:58,120
the chief security officer in the state

820
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:01,120
of Michigan came to us I think a year

821
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,919
and a half ago from he was at Ford but

822
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,500
before that he was part of the Obama

823
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,690
White House so he has experience with

824
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,639
the federal government he was just

825
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,020
weeks ago is talking to the Senate

826
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,929
Homeland Security and government affairs

827
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,599
committee about the needs of states for

828
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:19,599
cybersecurity sitting right beside Chris

829
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:20,919
crabs so we have some credibility there

830
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,369
and I don't have to do anything like

831
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:26,560
that but for everybody involved I always

832
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:27,970
put this slide up because I'm really

833
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,489
proud of the fact that we are at

834
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:32,980
partnership Michigan is fortunate to

835
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:34,899
have both air and Army National Guard in

836
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,819
the state work very closely with the

837
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:39,699
Michigan State Police we're all

838
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:43,060
civilians in the initial stages of

839
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:45,009
thinking about doing this it was thought

840
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,259
of having a part of the National Guard

841
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:49,929
and other states are starting with that

842
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,730
I happen to think that's not great idea

843
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,679
because there's restrictions and you

844
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,849
start as part of the National Guard

845
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,889
people are thinking they're going to be

846
00:34:54,849 --> 00:35:00,220
part of the part of the Guard rather

847
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:01,750
than the a bunch of volunteers and it's

848
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,609
just a different kind of cachet a

849
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,589
different attraction to it we end up

850
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:08,680
working very closely with with all of

851
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:11,799
these folks so in the our operational

852
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,040
procedure if there is a declared cyber

853
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:17,079
emergency then we partner with our

854
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,790
partners that I just mentioned and we

855
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:21,339
work under the authority of the State

856
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:24,279
Emergency Operations Coordinator which

857
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:26,470
is activated for more than just cyber

858
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,089
emergencies it's activated now actually

859
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:31,569
because we have coronavirus in the state

860
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:33,910
the the difficulty that I had with this

861
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:36,460
and a number of us had is that the

862
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,098
governor only declares a cyber emergency

863
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:42,520
if things are like really bad and the

864
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:45,760
standard scenario is when a nation-state

865
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,710
takes out a couple of power plants in

866
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,440
the Upper Peninsula during the winter

867
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,720
which means people are in danger of

868
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,420
freezing to death if you think about

869
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,310
that again just like I was talking about

870
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,170
if you have 50 percent of people who

871
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,819
don't have it we have admin privileges

872
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,780
if you think about this from a practical

873
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:06,759
standpoint if that is your mission to to

874
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,980
respond to a cyber event that takes out

875
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,290
a power plant there's not a lot of way

876
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:16,180
you can train for that and you can can

877
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:18,700
do ICS ot cons of training but

878
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:21,430
we amateurs are not going to be in going

879
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:24,368
in to look at network traffic we're

880
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:26,230
happy to hand out water and do stuff

881
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:28,359
like that but we there's going to be

882
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,970
professionals that can do that so the

883
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:33,940
challenge for the cyber sitting core is

884
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,680
exactly as I list hello how do you

885
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,319
recruit people for that mission it

886
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,029
sounds cool and if you can get uniforms

887
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:42,400
and equipment no people will sign up but

888
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:45,010
we don't how do you keep people engaged

889
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,260
and keep people from drifting off to do

890
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,020
something more exciting and at the time

891
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,790
the goal was just to get members there

892
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,580
wasn't a lot else going on that wasn't

893
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:56,130
in training

894
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,900
so and then the question is how do you

895
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,610
train for that mission and how do you

896
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,040
evaluate whether people gotten their

897
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:04,170
training for less serious incidents now

898
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,620
that we have the Michigan and cyber

899
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:11,460
civilian Act this is how things things

900
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:14,640
happen and that clear red is the cyber

901
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,920
incident something happens and people if

902
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,900
there is a cyber incident that they call

903
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,150
the Michigan cyber command center that's

904
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,130
part of the State Police MSP this

905
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,230
michigan state police personnel process

906
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:28,670
the complaint they determine if there's

907
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:33,330
any criminal component to it if there is

908
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:35,280
they go out and take take a get an image

909
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,930
of the disc they grab memory they do

910
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,900
whatever they need to do their employ

911
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:43,140
forensics and then they offer to the

912
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,780
affected entity which is usually a local

913
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,129
or regional government or agency they

914
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,320
say we have these people that can help

915
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,970
you because the State Police is only

916
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,150
interested in gathering evidence they

917
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:56,069
don't they don't do any looking to see

918
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,840
what happened or how you can keep it

919
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:00,270
from happening again it's only about law

920
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,330
enforcement so we can go in and do that

921
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:05,759
so we can send will scramble a team of

922
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:08,130
two or three people send them out to

923
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,560
basically create a relationship with the

924
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:13,440
affected entity and try and figure out

925
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,560
what's going on and do whatever we can

926
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,290
do to help them get a little bit more

927
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:22,320
secure we're not gonna I always say if

928
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:25,910
you if you've ever had sans security 504

929
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,620
the prevent identify contain eliminate

930
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:30,509
remediate and lessons learned we're

931
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,850
really about identify contain and

932
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,410
eliminate we don't for the most part do

933
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:36,660
remediation we're not going to reimage

934
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,460
drives and we're not going to write

935
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,170
policies but we can certainly give them

936
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,630
a lot of input to that

937
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,930
EMI c3 is not a resource for individual

938
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:48,609
citizens and their own networks we are

939
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:50,759
response team dedicated to assist small

940
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:53,078
and medium-sized businesses and

941
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,569
organizations and really non-commercial

942
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:57,130
ones we have had a lot of discussions

943
00:38:55,569 --> 00:39:00,099
about the proper role of government and

944
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,849
you all know that security is a cost of

945
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,069
doing business

946
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:05,890
we're government we're all going to

947
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:07,599
suffer if the government goes down so we

948
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,720
can we can help there and this is the

949
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,329
state sponsored activity people ask what

950
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,149
kind of what kind of things we respond

951
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:19,059
to and I am not at liberty to talk about

952
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:21,849
any of the details but I have clearance

953
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:25,540
to use this as an example imagine a

954
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:28,660
local government with say 250 to 300

955
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:31,240
endpoints maybe a dozen servers three of

956
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:35,410
them are locked up because of ransomware

957
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:38,348
say and those servers provide something

958
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:39,940
like licensing or tax documents or maybe

959
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:42,609
they have the connection to child

960
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:45,780
support payments so people are people in

961
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:49,630
the local community are are Satar are

962
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:52,930
inconvenienced perhaps significantly by

963
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:55,829
the lack of this this capability we

964
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:58,589
don't we've been involved in ransomware

965
00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:02,410
situations and we don't negotiate with

966
00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:04,690
ransomware people but I know that there

967
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,710
are people that do and sometimes the

968
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,270
local government will have an

969
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,490
arrangement with a third party that we

970
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,950
and try and coordinate with but that's

971
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:15,129
the that's the general I saying nothing

972
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:17,680
local governments are so under-resourced

973
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:20,950
that there's nothing complicated that

974
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:24,368
happens at least that we have seen this

975
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:27,819
is not the GRU our activities this is

976
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:29,500
our 2020 activities we had quarterly we

977
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:33,460
have try to have a face-to-face meeting

978
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,960
monthly we have telecon so to keep

979
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,270
people involved we also have a slack

980
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,059
channel that people participate in and

981
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:42,190
we've built a community where members

982
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:46,390
can trade information and somebody will

983
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:48,040
be installing or contemplating using a

984
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:50,379
new identity and access management

985
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,420
solution and they've got friends now

986
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:56,780
that they can ask have you done this

987
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:59,000
people do exercises and go to cons

988
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,310
together that sort of thing we have

989
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,580
planned twenty20 events I have an update

990
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:08,029
this April 17th we are tentatively

991
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:10,790
planning a day-long exercise to play

992
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:14,390
back doors and breeches because I saw a

993
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:17,360
lot of us saw the webcast that John al

994
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,890
did about competitive Becker's and

995
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,870
breeches we thought that was cool I

996
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:25,370
don't know if we're gonna run that now

997
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:27,080
because the corona but we we do want to

998
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,240
do that maybe we'll move that to the

999
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,400
fall we try to do something every

1000
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:35,299
quarter I said the face-to-face meeting

1001
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:38,210
our plans summer event is train training

1002
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,850
is security 504 which is a science class

1003
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,220
we have been fortunate to be able to

1004
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:45,950
provide Sands training who qualified

1005
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,810
members this will be our fifth year we

1006
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,740
did actually we've done saying this

1007
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,230
would be the fourth year we've done

1008
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:54,080
Sands we did five oh four or five years

1009
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,320
ago we're doing it again because we're

1010
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,180
going to require the gch exam

1011
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,070
certification after we did five before

1012
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,560
we did five I think it's five eleven the

1013
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,630
continuous monitoring thinking that we

1014
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:10,190
knew five before gave us the incident

1015
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:12,320
response process and then five eleven

1016
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,480
gave us the ability to or the knowledge

1017
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,430
of how to monitor assistance that you

1018
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,340
could tell if anything Bad's happen then

1019
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:21,649
we did forensics 572 which is Network

1020
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,370
forensics because we don't do endpoints

1021
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:27,950
forensics the State Police does that and

1022
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:31,549
and it's Phil Hagen will tell you you

1023
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:33,560
can solve solve a case using network

1024
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,380
forensics by the time the endpoint

1025
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,210
imaging is done so we did that in the

1026
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,730
last year we did security onion training

1027
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:42,830
along with I gotta give a shout-out to

1028
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,340
Chris Sanders Chris Sanders is like the

1029
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:47,960
wisest guy and the information security

1030
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:50,780
these days you should totally check out

1031
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,120
chris sanders org or applied network

1032
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,300
defense not just the technical stuff but

1033
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:59,569
he is a thinker and he's got a great

1034
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,790
course on investigation theory if you

1035
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,230
have technical debt in your in your

1036
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,870
organization because you've bought

1037
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:08,150
equipment and not done the training

1038
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:11,930
take that course and you'll make back

1039
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:14,450
10% of your of your technical deck debt

1040
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,279
across the board and if you don't come

1041
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,500
talk to me I think it's an amazing

1042
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,650
course so this is what the mi c3 does

1043
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,180
other than responding to incidents

1044
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:26,840
membership requirements we asked for at

1045
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:30,049
least two years of InfoSec I are digital

1046
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,600
or network forensics experience one

1047
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:35,210
foundational security certification it

1048
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,779
used to be security security plus the EH

1049
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:40,340
some GX cert we are proposing because we

1050
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:44,150
have a law now we have some oversight

1051
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:46,940
and we want to kind of crank up the the

1052
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:49,760
requirements proposing requiring the G

1053
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:53,960
CI h which is the certification along

1054
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:57,230
with sand security 504 it is a DoD 8570

1055
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,450
IAT level 3 certification you can look

1056
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,970
that up it just seems like exactly the

1057
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:05,120
right point for us and if anybody has a

1058
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:08,029
nonsense course or nonsense search that

1059
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,370
I would be that I should be looking at

1060
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,930
please send it along I'd love to get

1061
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:15,549
away from a single vendor but that's

1062
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,549
that's the way it goes

1063
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,359
look for employer support for 10 days of

1064
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,710
participation and we asked for a signed

1065
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:23,839
letter of agreement but that's not a

1066
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:26,000
legally binding thing especially for

1067
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:29,000
people that work at a large organisation

1068
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,069
like Ford or GM it would take forever to

1069
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,690
get a legal signature and we don't

1070
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:35,150
really have any holdover people if they

1071
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:37,760
don't show up to respond we can pick

1072
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:41,240
them off the core if they're inactive

1073
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:45,290
but we don't really have we don't want

1074
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:48,709
to do that so the employer agreement is

1075
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:50,119
really a convenience by courtesy for for

1076
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:51,559
us to get members so they can go into

1077
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,079
their manager and say hey I wanna do

1078
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,359
this this is what it looks like and that

1079
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,839
ten days is five or six days for

1080
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:02,480
training one or two exercises that would

1081
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:05,599
be our face-to-face meetings community

1082
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:10,080
volunteering that sort of thing that's

1083
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:12,750
not necessarily including incident spots

1084
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:17,220
process is I hope pretty simple you go

1085
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:19,770
to mi cyber Korg and please don't but

1086
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,870
you feel free to go there look at the

1087
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:25,410
page if you want to look at some of the

1088
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:27,540
stuff okay it's not hugely professional

1089
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:30,870
so I'm sure that any hacker could

1090
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:33,240
probably kill it so please don't the

1091
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:35,790
apply give us your name address credit

1092
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,830
card number blood type and all of those

1093
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:41,090
fecal sample of all of those things and

1094
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:46,259
we send you a link to the first test you

1095
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:48,500
take tests these are basic security

1096
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,910
beginning and advanced incident response

1097
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,300
basically you pass the basic security

1098
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:57,330
class you get a link to the basic ir and

1099
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,790
basic forensics tests if you pass the

1100
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:04,110
basic one of those you get a link to the

1101
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:05,880
advanced test and i i'm hoping that

1102
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,190
we're going to move away from the test

1103
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,080
that we currently have looking into

1104
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,750
somebody that can write some tests and

1105
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:15,930
look at our skill set help us devise a

1106
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:19,140
better test better entry exams that's

1107
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:21,149
where we are now if you or anybody that

1108
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,609
asks is four out of the five tests they

1109
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:26,730
get a congratulations you may be a

1110
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:29,250
wiener and send us a whole bunch of

1111
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,500
documentation that would be the resume

1112
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,700
the volunteer agreement which includes a

1113
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,140
nondisclosure agreement

1114
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,540
or your agreement which i've talked

1115
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,609
about and once we get that documentation

1116
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,190
we do a criminal background check the

1117
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:43,170
criminal background check is required by

1118
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:46,290
the michigan cyber civilian act and it

1119
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:48,810
does uncover stuff that people thought

1120
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,670
wouldn't be uncovered so we have having

1121
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,250
to deal with that and we now have

1122
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:56,280
because legislators wanted legislate

1123
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:59,820
they came to my boss and said hey what

1124
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,990
what do you need and so we're trying to

1125
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:04,390
get

1126
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:06,069
stations so that we can either have an

1127
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,480
appeal process for somebody might have

1128
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:10,510
done something when they're 12 years old

1129
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,820
and it's supposed to be expunged or just

1130
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:15,770
provide some kind of appeal process we

1131
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:18,260
don't have to avoid

1132
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:20,150
having people on the core but you can

1133
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,500
understand that in the law we want to

1134
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:23,940
make sure that we're not sending

1135
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,589
convicted felons out to do it

1136
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,140
after you get the background check

1137
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:31,980
complete we provide our michigan.gov

1138
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:34,670
email address and add them to the active

1139
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,390
roster by meetings that sort of thing

1140
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:39,960
our benefits

1141
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:42,990
I really believe we it's a win-win-win

1142
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,539
we've got benefits for the public with

1143
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:48,569
the state of Michigan the employer and

1144
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:50,280
the participant we get training

1145
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:51,960
opportunities for the individual member

1146
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,819
and the ability to collaborate with

1147
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,789
people you wouldn't ordinarily get to

1148
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:59,759
collaborate with we've done exercises

1149
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:03,720
along with the National Guard and I may

1150
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,670
be going to a major exercise here in a

1151
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,618
month if they don't cancel that and

1152
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,740
professional development standpoint you

1153
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:12,809
all know that more networking is great

1154
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:16,020
that's why you come to meetings like

1155
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:19,589
this and just collaboration across lots

1156
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:21,750
of different businesses within Michigan

1157
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:24,930
we have you know General Motors Ford we

1158
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:27,650
have two utility companies just a lot of

1159
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:31,589
stuff that you can collaborate on and

1160
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:34,500
lastly you know it's just fun we provide

1161
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:37,470
members of a platform to do what they

1162
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:40,079
love and at the same time help out the

1163
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:42,839
state now what how can you do better

1164
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,480
than that you sort of like get to do

1165
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:47,609
what you find engaging and accidentally

1166
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,160
people get have a benefit well this is a

1167
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:53,038
picture of some of our members just to

1168
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,589
show that we are real we have we have a

1169
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,779
few emails as the diversity is not what

1170
00:48:55,589 --> 00:49:00,240
I would like and we even have some

1171
00:48:57,779 --> 00:49:02,250
partners there they turned off the you

1172
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,038
know Fox News Home Shopping Network from

1173
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:08,400
all the screens this is in our State

1174
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,860
Emergency Operations Center we've gotten

1175
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,290
some awards and recognition most

1176
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,040
these are from 2017-18 that was back

1177
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,230
when we were getting the legislation

1178
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:19,140
done it's been kind of quiet in terms of

1179
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:21,420
actual official Awards now because we're

1180
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,240
actually doing work but I would point

1181
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,490
you to the the law fair blog article

1182
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,470
down there at the bottom is written by

1183
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:30,479
from the a new friend of mine

1184
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:32,700
Monica Ruiz works for the Hewlett

1185
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,890
Foundation Monica has been a huge

1186
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,740
supporter because she spent a year in

1187
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:40,529
Estonia and knows about the Estonian

1188
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:42,600
Civil Defence League or they actually

1189
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:44,880
get uniforms and there are a lot more

1190
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:48,330
people if you don't know Estonia is

1191
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,040
history with cyber cyber attacks from

1192
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:52,170
Russia you can only find that in

1193
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,450
Wikipedia they are a very well developed

1194
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,650
organization and I'm hoping one of these

1195
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,720
days I'm going to get over there and

1196
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,400
spend some time with them and learn what

1197
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,950
they're doing

1198
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,900
in turn we are getting calls I worked

1199
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:06,060
with a group at Columbia University's

1200
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,730
School of International and public

1201
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:11,490
affairs who is trying to spin up a

1202
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:15,630
similar effort or the New York cyber

1203
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:18,390
command center Ohio has one we did get

1204
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:20,700
the visitors from Hawaii and I'm hoping

1205
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,650
we can do a return visit and help them

1206
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,419
out because sure they need us to come

1207
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,370
out to Hawaii I think we've heard from

1208
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:28,830
the Colorado I've been to Washington I

1209
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:31,620
was going to be speaking with the former

1210
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:34,470
CEO of California if I had been in San

1211
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:37,500
Diego but I'm not

1212
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:38,879
so it's getting some some press the the

1213
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,580
NGA is the National Governors

1214
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,430
Association the NGA has a packet of

1215
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:46,770
information on how how a state can spin

1216
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:48,750
up something like this and everybody's

1217
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:51,960
got our phone number so the question is

1218
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:54,690
all right this is reactive and there's a

1219
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,580
lot of people that have problems and one

1220
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:58,980
of the things we're learning is the

1221
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:01,470
extent of problem there's so many local

1222
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:04,260
and regional governments that have only

1223
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,509
a single IT person and that person where

1224
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,609
it's about 8 hats and the one that they

1225
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:11,340
feel the most heaviest on their head is

1226
00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:13,680
getting password changed making things

1227
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:16,050
easier for people opening up remote

1228
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,000
access so people can work from home that

1229
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:22,320
sort of thing in the security as you all

1230
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,750
know is last on the list so as we are

1231
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,810
doing reactive stuff we're getting some

1232
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:30,060
press and other organizations are saying

1233
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:32,250
hey I don't actually want to call you I

1234
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:35,549
want to be protected from this how can

1235
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:37,080
we how can we prevent that

1236
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,210
Michigan a couple of years ago we had a

1237
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:43,080
pilot program called sea so as a service

1238
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:46,640
where the state would provide a what

1239
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:50,340
where the state provided a rental

1240
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:53,160
CSO and organizations for localities

1241
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:55,620
could buy into that service that was

1242
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,859
only a year-long pilot we're working on

1243
00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:00,900
a project to provide guidance because

1244
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:03,630
local and regional governments do get

1245
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,760
audited by a number of entities and so

1246
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:08,280
we're putting together a standard set of

1247
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,910
guidance that people so people going to

1248
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,320
be ready or that combination of audits

1249
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:17,100
and guidance is based on the sea is

1250
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:18,810
critical controls and beyond that we

1251
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,910
have something called the cyber partners

1252
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:24,360
initiative which is essentially a club

1253
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:27,210
or local and regional IT people just to

1254
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,860
be together meet once a month here from

1255
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,960
the state sock about the kinds of

1256
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:33,750
attacks they're seeing how to prevent it

1257
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,260
we had one of the MRC 3 members gave a

1258
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:39,420
presentation on how to use Showdown to

1259
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:40,770
to assess your external footprint this

1260
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,450
was in the past couple of months that

1261
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:45,900
was in response to an incident we

1262
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:49,410
responded to where if you use Showdown

1263
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:52,630
this organization was like way open so

1264
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:56,200
we're trying to move this to proactive

1265
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:58,300
this is my ending slide this is mr.

1266
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:02,049
Rogers has been sort of the hero of mine

1267
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:04,480
for since before he got popular I know

1268
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,610
that's the thing to say I was raised in

1269
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,340
the Presbyterian Church and I am in fact

1270
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:11,920
a Presbyterian elder Fred Rogers is a

1271
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:14,050
Presbyterian minister this is a famous

1272
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,350
quote of his I'd look for the helpers

1273
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:19,750
NYC 3 helps the helpers the people in

1274
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:22,620
uniform and the you know adults depend

1275
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:25,360
on helpers too or child support

1276
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:27,400
licensing and all that sort of thing the

1277
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,170
other reason that I would like Fred

1278
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,410
Rogers is because frankly he was a

1279
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:33,880
badass he figured out that there was in

1280
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:36,399
the Presbyterian Church the way the

1281
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,110
policy works you have to get approval

1282
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,540
from the height of the grand that's

1283
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:42,610
called the General Assembly so a local

1284
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,680
group of people will say hey we need a

1285
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:46,480
minister send us one of the General

1286
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,899
Assembly sends and these are

1287
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,480
well-defined groups of people

1288
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,500
congregations they're called red rogers

1289
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,240
figured out that there was a

1290
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:58,020
congregation that could not call in

1291
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:00,120
those kids they had no capability for

1292
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,920
asking but they needed him so he

1293
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,470
petitioned the General Assembly and said

1294
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,170
hey I need to do this and he made enough

1295
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:09,359
of a case that they changed things they

1296
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:11,160
made an exception for him and to me

1297
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:15,090
that's that's pretty badass

1298
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:17,310
so you want more information that's my

1299
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:21,480

00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:25,170
address my personal one is available if

1301
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:28,590
you look for it the Twitter is me and I

1302
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:32,550
tweet about dogs and son rarely InfoSec

1303
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:34,370
and sometimes political stuff not trying

1304
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,690
to stay away from it

1305
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:38,690
you can follow me if you want you can

1306
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:40,010
find me on LinkedIn and on Google at

1307
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:43,550
least I don't have the John strand

1308
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:46,220
problem you can look at our website that

1309
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:49,370
will redirect you just be aware that my

1310
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:52,970
site record will redirect you to some

1311
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:55,970
complicated content management page but

1312
00:54:52,970 --> 00:55:00,620
if you remember in my cyber Korg you'll

1313
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:02,060
get it you've got to get any questions

1314
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,589
my apologies if you mentioned this

1315
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:05,180
already but does all of your funding

1316
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:08,320
come from the state and what's the

1317
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:12,440
approximate budget for the org we get a

1318
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:15,500
sans we'll give you a discount if you

1319
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,840
allow them to battlecast from your

1320
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:22,190
location of your guarantee we guarantee

1321
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:26,220
65 seats well that this is you should

1322
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:29,190
talk to a sans salesperson

1323
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:31,709
but what we have seen is that they give

1324
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:35,960
a price break at 65 guaranteed seats and

1325
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:38,700
we can usually get 65 people so we get a

1326
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:42,090
very substantial discount less than 50%

1327
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:44,399
we have to allow them to simulcast from

1328
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,720
our site so they can advertise it like

1329
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,990
when they run things at Virginia Tech

1330
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:51,450
with Randi they'll broadcast from there

1331
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:53,759
and they let people sign up to take like

1332
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:57,750
an on-demand or V life force or manatee

1333
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,510
from a Randy site so I have no idea who

1334
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:02,940
else it's in now you can totally say the

1335
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,500
deal that Ray got was and that'll

1336
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,110
that'll help you with your negotiations

1337
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,810
with sand and then they're gonna say it

1338
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:11,430
was that football backing and I get

1339
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:15,090
phone calls somebody asked about

1340
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:17,790
InfraGard we are many of our members are

1341
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:20,160
part of InfraGard but InfraGard here

1342
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:21,840
doesn't do all that much they have

1343
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,359
meetings how they send out

1344
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:28,560
communications so we use them but in

1345
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:31,950
terms of actually having activities not

1346
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:34,799
a lot to do funding comes from the state

1347
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:37,129
yes and the budget of the organization

1348
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,920
is

1349
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:41,870
much training I don't remember it's less

1350
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,850
than a half a million

1351
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:47,140
I don't think it's less than a quarter

1352
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:49,850
million I don't know how public that is

1353
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,350
but it's I I mean it's like the

1354
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:52,880
legislature has to approve it I just

1355
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:55,670
don't know if it's a separate line item

1356
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,490
the I'm the only employee I work

1357
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:59,470
three-quarter time

1358
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:02,049
well do you know of any other states

1359
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:04,540
that have done something there is a no

1360
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:07,420
there is one in Ohio there are other

1361
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:13,750
states they're spinning stuff I think

1362
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:16,359
Ohio is OHC Ohio's III or LHC 3 again

1363
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:18,250
it's part of their National Guard

1364
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:20,680
structure

1365
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,540
and so I don't know how far along they

1366
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,560
are because every time they when they

1367
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,660
want to do anything they have to

1368
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:28,049
remember about the chain of command we

1369
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:31,120
have been sort of ignored or

1370
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:33,010
benevolently ignored or a while so

1371
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,470
that's how we've gotten to where we are

1372
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:37,150
I don't even know there was somebody

1373
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:39,180
that I don't know that realized we

1374
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:41,320
needed to get a law passed and they

1375
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:43,930
Legislative Analyst's took it

1376
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:46,120
they found a legislature and said hey

1377
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,669
you should sponsor this happened to be a

1378
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:50,529
guy you know in a nearby community so I

1379
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:52,870
thought you know he was the Republican

1380
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:56,050
the guy in my community was a Democrat

1381
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:59,859
they collaborated on it it's like you

1382
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:01,780
know again I'm the I'm the CTO guy that

1383
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:05,530
comes up with an idea but can't do the

1384
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:07,630
administrative stuff I need the was the

1385
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:10,880
Pepsi guy that came and saved tried to

1386
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:12,970

1387
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,470
