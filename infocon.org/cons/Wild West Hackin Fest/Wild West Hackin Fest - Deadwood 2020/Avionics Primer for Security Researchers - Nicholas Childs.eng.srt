1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,119
the next speaker i've got to be honest

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,320
is probably the i'm the most excited

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,400
about the speaker out of any of the

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,879
speakers at wild west hacking fest

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,960
and i want to explain why by the way um

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,840
i'm totally not setting him up

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,080
i truly feel that way so last year at

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,279
wild west hacking fest in deadwood south

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,759
dakota

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,599
we started up the new speaker workshop

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,560
and one of the goals of the new speaker

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,320
workshop

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,759
was to find people that haven't

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,359
presented before

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,880
that were just like diamonds in the

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,960
rough and to be honest

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
i think almost all the presenters did

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,520
really good

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,760
but there was one that

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,200
came up again and again all the people

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
that were in his talk

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
basically came to me and they basically

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,160
said not only was that presentation

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,399
great

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,199
but it should have been a keynote at a

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,239
conference

27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,320
that guy was fantastic so uh

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,480
nicholas are you on and ready to go yeah

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,079
i'm here really excited about the topic

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,358
one of the things that we really like uh

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,399
kind of kicking off with keynotes at

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,519
this conference

33
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,799
with gps uh fs checkery and kind of

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
moving into this is we really want

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,720
people to start thinking of computer

36
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,760
security

37
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,960
in all realms not just operating systems

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,080
and you know the standard things that

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,759
we're trying to protect

40
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,520
but starting to think differently and

41
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,600
this is definitely a talk to that end

42
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,200
so if you're ready sir please take it

43
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,520
away sir

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,320
all right well first off i want to say

45
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,200
thank you john

46
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,479
um this is an amazing opportunity i

47
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
honestly would not have been able to do

48
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,960
this without

49
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
you and everyone at wild west hacking

50
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,079
fest and i just got into it through

51
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,600
volunteer work and i just got more and

52
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,880
more excited and i loved it

53
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,479
this talk is not sanctioning or

54
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,399
saying hey let's go do illegal stuff

55
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,960
with aircraft this talk is simply a

56
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,720
call to action i found a few things i

57
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,240
had a few things that were going on when

58
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,920
i was working on aircraft avionics

59
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,280
systems i saw some vulnerabilities and

60
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,640
later on when i started getting into

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,479
network security

62
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
i started applying those things the

63
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,079
first time i gave this talk

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
i had been handing out the patches it's

65
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,880
the comnab mission system patches the

66
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,799
oas

67
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,798
offensive avionics systems and the

68
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
reason why we had that was because

69
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,039
we were deployed to send the planes over

70
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,800
to syria in 2018

71
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,480
and comnab we never had much of

72
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239
representation we've always been called

73
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,599
wizards because the avionics guys

74
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
when it comes to the mechanic guys and

75
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,879
avionics avionics guys have always been

76
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,239
wizards and we got sick of having

77
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,319
wizards on our patch

78
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,920
and what the atlas is holding up is the

79
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,519
heaviest component we have it's a low

80
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
observable antenna

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,720
uh it's used for targeting and uh target

82
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
acquisition and

83
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,000
and also for flying very low very very

84
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,519
fast

85
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,040
but that's what our patch is and i have

86
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,640
the same stickers this is an old

87
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,799
iteration of it the new one

88
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,920
has a poke ball in it because that's

89
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,120
what everybody was doing while we were

90
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,720
deployed but

91
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,080
on with it if you guys want the stickers

92
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
i'll try to find a way to get them out

93
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,720
to you

94
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,000
i don't have a lot of stuff i'm doing

95
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,280
this all on my own i bought my own

96
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,720
stickers and stuff so

97
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
you know please be patient if it takes

98
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,359
me some time to get all the shipping and

99
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,519
everything done

100
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,400
all right so who i am i'm i'm still in

101
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,040
the air force

102
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,800
uh this talk is not necessarily

103
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
sponsored or sanctioned by the air force

104
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,480
but it is approved by the air force

105
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,920
it's not something that they want

106
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
everyone to know about but i find it

107
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,720
important that the community get

108
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,440
involved in order to make this

109
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,879
a better field a stronger field i'm a b1

110
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,200
weapon systems controller that works at

111
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,799
the

112
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,159
maintenance operations control center

113
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
get to see everything going on in the

114
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,640
group

115
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,920
but my specialty is com nav mission

116
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,799
systems and it's been on multiple

117
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,238
airframes

118
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,760
there's my contact information if

119
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
anybody anybody wants to get a hold of

120
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,399
me

121
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
why i'm giving this talk as i said

122
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,599
things are broken avionics systems were

123
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
designed for use not for security

124
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,640
they're also designed for safety

125
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,720
you remember everything's going to fail

126
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,480
to open on an aircraft when a system

127
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,480
fails everything opens the information

128
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
goes back and forth without any problem

129
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,119
and like most legacy systems you're

130
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,599
going to have the same thing with ics

131
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
and stuff

132
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,640
but they're not secure because they're

133
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,798
not normally integrated into all the

134
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,839
other stuff until recently

135
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,040
so i need your help or as i said at the

136
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
conference i'm not going to scream this

137
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,840
into my mic we're all going to die

138
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,359
so first off uh after giving my talk the

139
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,400
first time

140
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,760
i had a lot of feedback on it and this

141
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,239
feedback was from

142
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,159
mariah kinney she works the meta ctf and

143
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,040
says she's a dm for the meta ctf going

144
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,720
on right now

145
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,879
uh gave me some ideas with t cast and

146
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,359
things like that chris kubecka

147
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,159
got a hold of me and she was doing a pin

148
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,600
past a very

149
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,039
major aviation industry company i'm not

150
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,639
going to say which one but you can go to

151
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,280
that talk and you can see it and

152
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,800
it had lined up with a lot of my concern

153
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,840
to include a lot of the commercial off

154
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,560
the shelf system

155
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,880
and the systems that are used to load

156
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
the

157
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,400
operational flight plan on the aircraft

158
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,560
and then

159
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,919
uh olivia stella gave a talk yesterday

160
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,280
that was amazing because i never

161
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,799
understood the oversight

162
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,960
in the aviation industry when it came to

163
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
cyber security and she was able to

164
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,320
present all the policies and stuff and i

165
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
i just suggest that you guys watch that

166
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
talk

167
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,680
and check out those links i'm going to

168
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,479
be reading through those books soon

169
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,840
myself

170
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,680
who am i 18 years experience comnav

171
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,520
mechanical i've done mechanical repair

172
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,199
and servicing on

173
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,960
commercial aircraft it didn't go past

174
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,400
that because i'm not a licensed mechanic

175
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,479
uh 737's l1011s dc10 747s

176
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,320
and then uh the avionics systems that i

177
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,479
worked on efficient with

178
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,080
are the c17 c5 c141 and kc 135 and then

179
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,159
as of recently the b1

180
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,919
had multiple cyber security

181
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
certifications they've all expired

182
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,680
it's simply because my work won't pay

183
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,560
for them because i'm not

184
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
in that field i'm an avionics technician

185
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,360
i am an fcc radio telephone operator

186
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,000
licensed

187
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
with a general radar endorsement i have

188
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
that license right now and i'm able to

189
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,520
function those areas in the civilian

190
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,520
realm when it does come down to it

191
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,280
so uh this is basically us aircraft

192
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,960
mechanics i was told i didn't have

193
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
enough memes in my last box so i'm going

194
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,359
to include them now even though they're

195
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,440
aircraft mechanic names

196
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
i probably suffer from 90 of those

197
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,080
problems you see on the screen but this

198
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,758
is basically us

199
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,199
and i'm sure every team has that same

200
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,240
problem with that the same group of

201
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,560
people

202
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,320
so uh i'm going to start out with the

203
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
the bus system on the aircraft

204
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,759
what did the bus system solve why do we

205
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
have it communication along the bus

206
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,400
system

207
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,080
how it speaks together and then a few

208
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,159
networks you should know about

209
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,479
and also i'm going to be able to talk

210
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,000
about maybe some attack vectors

211
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,199
it's just when we talk about the attack

212
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
vectors you gotta understand i don't

213
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,440
have poc

214
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,680
because that bar is difficult to get

215
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
across but i do have a lot of concepts

216
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,360
that i've

217
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,039
understood and seen and also i ignore

218
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
you guys if you have any questions

219
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,800
i do have the discord right in front of

220
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,239
me i will try to address them as i go

221
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
i'm actually doing this to challenge

222
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
myself to see if i'm capable of

223
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,758
multitasking like that i probably fail

224
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,479
see if you guys can make me fail

225
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,520
so what does the problem what problems

226
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,000
does the dust system

227
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,840
solve well first off we have the old

228
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,479
analog system and with the old analog

229
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,638
system

230
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,560
you had a mess of wires running between

231
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,720
each of the nav instruments and the

232
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,720
back end systems your navigation

233
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,160
autopilot uh your control

234
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,240
even what we were saying earlier with

235
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,680
the vor ils

236
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,840
it would cut in and out like uh

237
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,599
i'm sorry my audio is doing that the uh

238
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,119
vr i left for instance

239
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,199
you would have to run three hardwires

240
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,039
from the rt to the display

241
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,720
and the problem with that is as you add

242
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,000
more things to

243
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,639
uh the platform it gets more

244
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,639
and more heavy so of course we wanted to

245
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,720
go to a distributed digital system

246
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,400
which led to a federated digital system

247
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
which has a subnet things like that and

248
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,599
then the

249
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,199
the modern one the integrated modular

250
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,759
now with that that's more gonna

251
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,560
have the structure of your networks your

252
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,759
computer networks and stuff

253
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,720
first thing starting out with the mil

254
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,759
standard 1553 came out in 1973 it's an

255
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,680
old system

256
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,440
this legacy system is still in

257
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,319
production it's still used underneath a

258
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,719
lot of the old

259
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
weapons platforms the newer stuff even

260
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
with the new

261
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,599
avionics systems built on top of it with

262
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,520
the screens and everything else

263
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,520
a lot of the underlying networks say the

264
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,799
nerve center of the aircraft is still

265
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,039
this 1553.

266
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,879
we just stack on top of it so any

267
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,318
vulnerability that exists in this legacy

268
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,520
system is going to be carried over into

269
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,680
the new aircraft

270
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,758
first using the f-16 fighter long time

271
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,440
ago it's an old bus system

272
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,520
so i'm starting out with the distributed

273
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,080
digital bdhi adi

274
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,840
uh engine stuff as it's distributed

275
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,878
digital the way this works

276
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,479
is you have say a bsiu a bus system

277
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,800
integrated unit running on the pilot

278
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,599
co-pilot side and typically a backup

279
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,560
and on this screen you can see a radar

280
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,120
set

281
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,479
on the pilot side just over the right to

282
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,919
the center console and all the ribbons

283
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,240
and things like that

284
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,520
these are separated into those buses and

285
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,120
it's important to understand that this

286
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,560
is the older system and as i said

287
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,240
you're going to have the newer systems

288
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,958
built on top of it

289
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,959
now as we advance the modern control

290
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,000
navigation system this is the c5 galaxy

291
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,159
cockpit

292
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,360
the funny thing is it looks complicated

293
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,360
with the screens and everything but it's

294
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
actually very simplified everything on

295
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,080
the left side is controlled by one

296
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,440
computer everything on the right side is

297
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,360
controlled by another computer

298
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
so instead of all of these additional

299
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,560
computers and backups you only have to

300
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,240
focus on the pilot or co-pilot side it

301
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,399
doesn't go much deeper than that

302
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
so you know as a as far as attack

303
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,519
surface goes

304
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,279
uh you've got two critical points of

305
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,279
failure on both sides

306
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,680
any questions so far are you guys able

307
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,279
to hear me perfect

308
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,880
so i give you a uh basic

309
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,240
generic 1553 data bus i found that a lot

310
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
of the civilian buses when i did some

311
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
research

312
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,440
is about the same way this is set up you

313
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,440
have a bus controller

314
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,040
remote terminals with subsystems based

315
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,720
on it and then you have a subsystem with

316
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,399
an embedded remote terminal

317
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,480
basically a remote terminal just matches

318
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,519
the impedance for the lru the line

319
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,760
replaceable unit

320
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,040
that is trying to talk on the bus system

321
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,160
and a lot of the

322
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,800
a lot of systems have them built in so i

323
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,719
wanted to put together an example

324
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
of one this is one that i've worked with

325
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,440
before physically had my hands on this

326
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
one

327
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,519
and um so you've got your bus system uh

328
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,439
your rt

329
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,839
receiver transmitter for hf if there's

330
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,600
any ham radio operators raise your hand

331
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
because this is uh this actually speaks

332
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,880
along the same frequencies as the ham

333
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,480
back when at work we would talk to the

334
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,000
ham radio operators

335
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,320
and on the left side you see you have

336
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,160
the old uh controller

337
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
and on the right side is the bs iu that

338
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,600
i was speaking about with the cdu which

339
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,360
is the control display unit

340
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,839
the cool thing about this bus system is

341
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,399
as it advances you can maintain the old

342
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,240
structure in the background and you can

343
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,760
upgrade through attrition but every

344
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,200
single one of the aircraft bus systems

345
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,720
has the bus controller

346
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,399
all the traffic goes through that bus

347
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,279
controller and it's redistributed to the

348
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,320
lrus

349
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,640
one by one and this allows say

350
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,839
ids monitoring or you know can you

351
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,600
imagine what would happen if you were to

352
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,760
take down that bus controller

353
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,720
they do reset a lot if they get too much

354
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,000
information

355
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,760
i'm just going to throw that out there

356
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
to you the hard part of course is

357
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,040
getting on this network

358
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,959
any questions about the diagram

359
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,480
i wanted to show an example of a bus

360
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,760
controller and that is the

361
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,760
sits the uh sits controller here on the

362
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,200
b1 i got this off of a public website

363
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,800
normally i was really surprised to see

364
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
this because it's the defensive avionics

365
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,920
systems

366
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,519
seat there's a lot of crazy stuff on the

367
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,640
screens there for defending the aircraft

368
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,399
but

369
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,079
that big screen over on the right side

370
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,760
is the sits controller

371
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,680
that allows you to go through it can

372
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,880
take over entire bus traffic

373
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,959
and you can go through and actually

374
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
reset systems from there even down the

375
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,199
circuit breakers

376
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,480
that are hooked into like relays you can

377
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,360
make them open and close circuit

378
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,440
breakers

379
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,640
this is your bus controller and i want

380
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,240
you guys to get a good look at that how

381
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,279
that works you can actually put codes in

382
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,200
there you can

383
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
stem certain things and get responses

384
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,399
back and

385
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,079
that is just a good example of the

386
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,560
military setup now

387
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,760
for commercial now understand that a lot

388
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,239
of these i've just had to do

389
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,439
academic look at these because i don't

390
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,959
have

391
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
a lot of physical hands-on with the

392
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,079
avionics on this side

393
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,760
but all of these things are available

394
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,880
online and all you have to do is go to

395
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,880
the links i'm going to have them at the

396
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
end i try to do as many references as i

397
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
can

398
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,639
because as i said this is your talk i

399
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
want you guys to jump in on this

400
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
the whole point is to present this to

401
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
you smart people way smarter than

402
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,200
i am and be able to find solutions to

403
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
some of these problems that i may have

404
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,120
found

405
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,959
working in avionics systems so on this

406
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,560
uh you have your general systems

407
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,920
the high integrity bus is going to be a

408
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,279
little bit slower but you have a lot of

409
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,199
data redundancy and of course you can

410
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,880
see why you got secondary power fuel

411
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,880
electrical power propulsion

412
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,560
very important things and then of course

413
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,040
the avionic system is where i normally

414
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,199
spend

415
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,360
my time flight control navigation aid

416
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,399
cockpit air data computer

417
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,920
coms navigation landing aids and

418
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,320
as you can see this is still all on the

419
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,800
same network and as olivia had said it

420
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
is

421
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,839
subnetted they are they are separated

422
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,200
networks but they do communicate

423
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,040
together and they have to

424
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,480
because of the weight as we go back to

425
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,920
again you have a

426
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
centralized nervous system of the

427
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,319
aircraft and everything sits on that

428
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,560
nervous system

429
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,639
for the b1 itself the nervous system

430
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,560
itself actually controls the power

431
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,800
you can redistribute power between the

432
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,680
aircraft because of signals on that bus

433
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,839
system

434
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,199
and they did that on purpose because

435
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,160
whenever you have certain functions

436
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,480
going on

437
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,760
you gain and lose power because there's

438
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,680
only so much power coming from the

439
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,360
engines to operate the entire system

440
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,120
now we're going to look at the language

441
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,200
of this so on the

442
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,360
language itself manchester 2 encoding is

443
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,440
what's used for the 1553b

444
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,959
and it uses the binary phase shift king

445
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,160
it compares just the two frequencies and

446
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,680
then finds the difference in them in

447
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,360
order to speak a little bit more

448
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
and as you can see the accuracy of 0.1

449
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,680
percent over long term

450
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,199
0.01 over short term this is whenever

451
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,959
you start to get outside of that

452
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,240
variance you start to get faults

453
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,518
and the system will start reporting

454
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,480
faults and i'll show you that in a

455
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,480
second how a

456
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,600
status word works it's a basically a

457
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,839
network packet

458
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,440
gonna send it and then send it back yeah

459
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,639
i am talking about the evolution of the

460
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,480
protocols

461
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,639
because i'm just starting at the basics

462
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,079
and going up the only problem is i can

463
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,959
only speak on the protocols that i'd be

464
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,479
able to research

465
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,719
so if you guys are out there looking for

466
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,240
more things i wanted to find the primary

467
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,720
stuff for the mill standard

468
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,399
and even the newer aircraft still use

469
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,160
this mill standard on the bottom

470
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,360
and then i looked up the boeing standard

471
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,000
and the airbus standard and i'll be

472
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,800
getting to those

473
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,880
soon it's very very surprising what kind

474
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,519
of advancements have been made

475
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,560
uh whether good or bad so we go over to

476
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,240
the status word

477
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,599
status word this is what it looks like

478
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,279
your bit times

479
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
uh you got a sync rate remote terminal

480
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
address what information is going to

481
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,040
remember

482
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,240
all of this information goes to the bus

483
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,160
controller

484
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,760
too far goes to the bus controller and

485
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,120
then comes right back to the system that

486
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,040
it was supposed to go to

487
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,959
so you do have that single point like an

488
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,000
old hub like an old network hub

489
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,920
so uh of course as you can see you sync

490
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,079
your sync to start the timing remote

491
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,199
terminal uh transmit received then the

492
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,560
sub address mode

493
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,639
and then the data word what it's trying

494
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,160
to do in account what's going to be in

495
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
the data hey prep here it comes

496
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,800
and then your data itself and then your

497
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,240
status word every time this is sent out

498
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,920
you're going to get a response status

499
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,160
from the device so if i tell

500
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,560
the hfrt that i showed you guys earlier

501
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,439
i tell the hfrt to key the radio

502
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,518
it returns a spot responsive key no key

503
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,560
also this stuff is all collected in the

504
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,480
maintenance data

505
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,638
which people were getting a look at on

506
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,959
the f-16 at defcon

507
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,399
recently uh that was a maintenance data

508
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,599
collection unit i found that very

509
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,399
interesting that that was given to

510
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,320
everyone

511
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,959
for next we'll go over to the civilian

512
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,839
one this is uh this is stuff i'm not as

513
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,439
familiar with

514
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,279
but because i understand the foundation

515
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,399
of the systems i will try to answer

516
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
whatever questions i have

517
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,920
and we'll all go we'll figure it out on

518
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
our own i can even

519
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,199
try to find some resources to get us

520
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,839
going the right direction so with this

521
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,279
the arinc 429 coded language

522
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,880
this is the boeing standard for the

523
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,360
legacy systems

524
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,600
each word is 32 bits there's no more

525
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,680
than 20 receivers on a single wire

526
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,120
which is not good when you have the

527
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,000
amount of systems on there i said this

528
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,519
is legacy

529
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,440
so you imagine you have a bus controller

530
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,639
you can only control 20 items

531
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,880
and that's going to be your control

532
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,240
panels your displays your receiver

533
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,839
transmitters and everything so you can

534
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,199
see this is kind of an outdated system

535
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,000
because you'd have to have multiple bus

536
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,160
controllers

537
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
in order to keep this system going as a

538
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,680
full you know aircraft because there's

539
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,800
definitely more than 20 lru's on an

540
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,319
aircraft

541
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,680
it does use positive and negative

542
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,440
voltage gives it a little bit more

543
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,560
variation in speaking you can also pack

544
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,000
more information in there

545
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,000
instead of 16 bit each word is 32 bits

546
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,839
unidirectional transmit receiver on

547
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,360
different ports so you have one port for

548
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,759
transmit the other for receive

549
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,480
with the 1553 you typically have an a

550
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,040
side and a b

551
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
side sending the same information and a

552
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,680
lot of the

553
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,440
faults that we get in maintenance are

554
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,439
disagrees between the a side and b side

555
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,920
that helps us troubleshoot a lot

556
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,440
12.5 50 or 100 kilobytes per second is

557
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,040
speed there

558
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,959
and this is what the words look like

559
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,599
they can they're going to contain the

560
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,160
parity to match everything up

561
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,839
sign status matrix then your data and

562
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,079
then your source destination label which

563
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,920
is

564
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,758
again your address saying what is there

565
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,880
and it's the same information going back

566
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,480
and forth

567
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,079
so fragile software applications

568
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,360
commercial alliance could speak

569
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,519
the main problem i've had with

570
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,320
commercial airline stuff uh

571
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,040
and this was talked about yesterday was

572
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,480
the

573
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,000
kind of commercial off-the-shelf

574
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
equipment being included onto those

575
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,560
networks

576
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
because we already know inherently what

577
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,040
comes in the that equipment the

578
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,199
additional equipment

579
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,120
also the good old bring your own device

580
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,279
because we actually have air crew

581
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,240
loading maps say on an ipad and such i

582
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,240
don't know

583
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,599
if they have any way to transfer that

584
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,640
information to the aircraft

585
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,599
to say load a flight plan or whatever

586
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,919
but i do know that there is a system

587
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,918
called

588
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,439
roi that lets you do things like that

589
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,000
you can do data transfers and we're also

590
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,319
going to get into

591
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,079
that as well with data transfers to and

592
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,720
from the aircraft

593
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,399
that's based on a vhf data link system

594
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,720
that's in the future slides

595
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,720
now we go to the airbus the more modern

596
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,280
standard afdx

597
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,280
avionics full duplex ethernet switching

598
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,480
yes ethernet switching this one kind of

599
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,080
scares me a little bit

600
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,320
because we're starting to use the the

601
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,840
standard network systems on the aircraft

602
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,760
i get it because we can bring less

603
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,639
expensive hardware to it and we can keep

604
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
it running

605
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,640
i mean we all know how secure a cisco

606
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,160
router is right absolutely 100

607
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,520
secure but on this uh it's scaled down a

608
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,799
little bit two megabytes per second each

609
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,799
word is 32 bits

610
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,080
and as i said the cots integration

611
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,760
commercial off the shelf

612
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,320
i do have a really bad habit of um

613
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,919
of acronyms so if i go too far in the

614
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,159
acronyms you guys let me know

615
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,960
i'll step back and i'll read them out

616
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,799
and here is the afdx

617
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,240
packet i'm not going to go too much into

618
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
this you guys know more about this than

619
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
i do

620
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,480
i mean i play around with wireshark a

621
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,360
little bit but this is how it

622
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,360
communicates

623
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,120
and a lot of you can maybe figure this

624
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,600
out if you don't want to do anything

625
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,320
packing injections just saying that it

626
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,120
could be out there if you're interested

627
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,480
now attack vectors not saying they exist

628
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,600
i'm just saying these are probable

629
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,360
attack detectors

630
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,439
if they existed so as i said the

631
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,799
commercial off the shelf devices

632
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,559
uh cots and the local data connections

633
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,559
the devices within the network if you

634
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,840
have something say uh

635
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,799
ofp the official flight plan operating

636
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,480
play plan stuff

637
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,000
loaded which is your your firmware for

638
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,520
your hardware in there

639
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
if that's loaded and say you have some

640
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,320
malware in that you can distribute along

641
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,080
that network but once again everything

642
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,520
goes through the controller

643
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,840
on those systems and the nice thing

644
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,440
about that is if you have a maintenance

645
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,959
crew that knows what they're looking for

646
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,240
they can easily look at the log system

647
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,679
and see what's going on

648
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
so i think in the future it's going to

649
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,480
be really important for a lot of

650
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,679
maintenance units and classes for

651
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,000
aircraft maintainers

652
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,760
to learn what a bad packet is learn what

653
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,799
an injection is and learn all that stuff

654
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,320
so

655
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,639
don't be surprised if a whole lot of

656
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,039
aircraft maintainers start getting in

657
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,160
your

658
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,400
your fields a little bit and start

659
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,000
asking you questions and as i said

660
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,280
you know we all know this attack vector

661
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,919
people people are always a very weakly

662
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,720
it's easy to to take advantage of a

663
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,400
person

664
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,039
over the hardware itself most of the

665
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,240
time so i wanted to show you guys an

666
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,760
example of a

667
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,280
commercial off-the-shelf system this is

668
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,320
what is used to load the 1553 data boss

669
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,080
this laptop and uh

670
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,960
we do see what windows operating system

671
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,480
is on there and we do understand the

672
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,120
problems that can be associated with

673
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,880
that system but a lot of the

674
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,320
a lot of the hardware used to load

675
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,240
aircraft systems are

676
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,678
old legacy systems because it takes such

677
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,200
a long time

678
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,200
to update the hardware and update

679
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,720
everything else with it it has to be

680
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,080
approved and there's a lot of channels

681
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,039
to go through so because of that there's

682
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,840
a big legacy

683
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,559
like there's a gap in this case windows

684
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,000
7.

685
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,280
i did have to put a sticker on there

686
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,400
because i had to cover up the username

687
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,080
and password

688
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,440
that is a normal maintenance practice

689
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,120
believe it or not because

690
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,400
you need to standardize it it needs to

691
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,760
be loaded quick and it needs to be

692
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,720
loaded efficiently and a lot of times

693
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,960
the guys will grab

694
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,400
this device log into it and get going

695
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,080
and just follow the instructions step by

696
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
step on how to load the aircraft

697
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,120
so take that as you will i mean you can

698
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,199
see that as a vector

699
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,559
if somebody's in a hurry to get things

700
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,640
loaded and you were

701
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,158
there handing them the software prepped

702
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,919
and ready and they're

703
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,840
and they have a deadline to meet you

704
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,200
know you all know about the the

705
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,720
pressures of that especially in the

706
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,280
airline industry in the same way in the

707
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,360
dod

708
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,639
like you imagine in a combat situation

709
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
you know people are going to do what

710
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,799
they can to get a hold of that software

711
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,639
you hand it to a person that's in need

712
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,840
of it you know who knows what's going to

713
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,200
happen

714
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,360
as i said with the cots and stuff and

715
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,120
just a more look at the hardware

716
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,799
this is your standard this is what you

717
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,678
use to connect to the aircraft from that

718
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,879
laptop

719
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,039
it's the ofp loading the

720
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,240
primary flight computer satcom this is

721
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,400
what you can load as a

722
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,240
primary flight computer satcom network

723
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,799
radio inertial navigation units

724
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,919
uh funny thing because of the gps time

725
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,918
travel

726
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,080
that was uh that larry pesci was talking

727
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,200
about just a heads up a lot of inertial

728
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,918
navigation systems

729
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,039
use gps for updates and parity checks

730
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,600
i'm not saying you're going to make an

731
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,000
aircraft

732
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,918
crash by giving it bad gps but you are

733
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,440
going to cause faults across the system

734
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,720
you are going to cause red flags to come

735
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,080
up things are going to pop up saying

736
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,320
there's something wrong

737
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,918
because it uses the inertial navigation

738
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,439
system but you do have drift say if

739
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,520
you're in a 12-hour flight

740
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,520
you know that spinning gimbal is going

741
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,280
to be off after so long so it

742
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,559
just double checks with gps resets

743
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,520
itself and keeps going

744
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,720
also we do use external media some of

745
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,039
that external media would be the hot

746
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,640
swappable hdd pcmcia cards

747
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,879
still believe it or not we still use

748
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,840
those usb drives and sd

749
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,120
cards once again if that software is in

750
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,480
the wrong place the wrong time on the

751
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,879
wrong hardware if you know what you're

752
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,640
doing

753
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,159
there could be some problems especially

754
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,039
if you understand the

755
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,720
hardware itself that's on the airframe

756
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,640
and i do kind of have an example because

757
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,799
of the recent events that have happened

758
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,120
and some updates to my slide i say the

759
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,280
vectors external data connections

760
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,399
so i'm going to go over the controller

761
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,240
pilot data link

762
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,799
which i found very interesting it's a

763
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,159
new system uh used for

764
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,840
the handshake between air traffic

765
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,640
control in the air and the cool thing

766
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,399
about it is

767
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,080
it makes things a lot easier they can

768
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,600
cue up more aircraft instead of having

769
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,480
to deal with the radio waiting for radio

770
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,719
traffic

771
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,640
they can they can actually see a text

772
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,600
message queue and follow that with their

773
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,880
identifications

774
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240
there's a few issues with it they've

775
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,280
found a few problems with it but they're

776
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,280
working those through

777
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,879
i think inherently well i'll show you

778
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,360
what the the issue is that i have with

779
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,400
it

780
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,760
inherently once again we say encoding is

781
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,240
not encryption

782
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,120
say it with me everybody encoding is not

783
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,720
encryption

784
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,799
now the other system is more of a legacy

785
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,480
system the a cars aircraft communication

786
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,840
addressing and reporting system

787
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,440
i always looked that it could be an

788
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,320
injection variable if you're sitting to

789
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,559
the aircraft

790
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
a lot of times on a lot of the systems

791
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,080
this is something that just

792
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,280
sends to the ground when an aircraft

793
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,039
takes off and lands

794
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,639
something we used to do at the ramstein

795
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,000
whenever we working on our time off i

796
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,679
had a scanner and i plugged it to a

797
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,600
laptop took the audio into the laptop

798
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,320
and it had a decoder this is before

799
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,000
sdr hardware was available and you could

800
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
actually see when an aircraft would take

801
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,159
off

802
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,439
we could get the fuel load the faults

803
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,080
that it took off with

804
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,159
and the weight like the cargo weight and

805
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,879
just basic information like that uh tail

806
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,880
number

807
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,039
and the same thing you can get off the

808
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,200
iff for identification purposes but

809
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,960
every time a 747 would take off or land

810
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,880
we would get that it gets that off the

811
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,159
wheels up wait on wheels weight on

812
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,360
wheels would release and do this and it

813
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,720
would send out these pulses

814
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,320
but the aircraft is also a lot of

815
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,159
aircraft are set up i'm not saying that

816
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,960
one is but a lot of aircraft are set up

817
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,559
to receive stuff as well on this system

818
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,559
when i worked on c5s

819
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,158
we had this system that could receive

820
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,600
weather updates to make flight plan

821
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,279
changes and it literally just printed

822
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,039
out in thermal paper

823
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,799
but if you were to manage to get some

824
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,240
code injection on that it's going along

825
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,360
that bus system

826
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,080
at one single nerve network along the

827
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,279
aircraft

828
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,720
and once again if you understand the

829
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,240
hardware on that aircraft what could you

830
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,559
do what could a person want to do with

831
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,600
that

832
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,360
and then i will go over t casts uh

833
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,959
misdirection and wizard's magic the

834
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,240
reason why i say wizards remember com

835
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,080
nav were wizards

836
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,679
and then preventative measures done

837
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,520
right i have an example of an aircraft

838
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,360
network that i really appreciate how it

839
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,720
was put together because of

840
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,639
what it is it has pre-shared keys

841
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,240
it's very encrypted it uses multiple

842
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,480
layers of uh

843
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,720
not just authentication but encryption

844
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,240
as well uh as well as using have quick

845
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,279
in times of need

846
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,360
so uh cpldc as

847
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,720
i'm saying the data lane controller uh

848
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,559
just an example

849
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,760
of too many aircraft working in the same

850
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
area they couldn't get

851
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,919
queued up properly in order to talk to

852
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,639
each other so they had to

853
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,200
start using this tech system and i have

854
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,440
an example of what the screen looks like

855
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,279
it's an application layer relying on an

856
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,919
existing vdl to the vhf

857
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,039
datalink 2 used for sending clear text

858
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,440
messages between atc

859
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,039
and pilot operators and it is based on

860
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,200
ground and it is based uh

861
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,720
off satellites as well as long as you've

862
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,039
got multiple connections you can keep

863
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,720
that

864
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,360
and send the detects back and forth

865
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
yeah hardware uh so a lot of hardware on

866
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,600
the aircraft you're asking about the

867
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,200
temperatures

868
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,279
there's a lot of hardware that is

869
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,520
shielded in certain places

870
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,799
and there's a lot of things in place to

871
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
keep stuff from overheating

872
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,200
once again say your cooling system

873
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,440
breaks down

874
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,440
a cooling system breaks down on

875
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,918
what you're doing you're going to get a

876
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,559
fault of that cooling system

877
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,760
before you get a the system crashed

878
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,600
they're just designed that way

879
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,799
for instance i another way that that

880
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,439
works is say

881
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,559
dhf radio i had a vhf radio incident

882
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,279
that kept happening

883
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,158
because the pilot would select the vhf

884
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,960
radio

885
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,640
and then whenever they tried to whatever

886
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,159
they talk on it and then they put it

887
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,120
down and when the hand mic was put down

888
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,279
it would be key

889
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,279
and once it was keyed past three minutes

890
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,039
the radio would go into a shutdown mode

891
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,640
the shutdown mode has to be given to the

892
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,240
backshop to reset but

893
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,799
it keeps it from overheating and causing

894
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,480
any major fault breakdowns

895
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,320
a lot of the stuff is designed that way

896
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,400
you're going to get the same way with

897
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,678
with overheating and you say temperature

898
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,440
you're going to get the faults about the

899
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,039
temperature before things start breaking

900
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,720
they're just designed that way

901
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,720
a lot of air crew have in-flight

902
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,159
emergency procedures for those overheat

903
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,080
stuff because you need to land before

904
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,200
something bad happens okay so i went

905
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,279
back to the a cars

906
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,760
it's based off of vhf and it also uses

907
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,000
hf high frequency

908
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,000
and it as i was saying it receives the

909
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,520
data and puts it on the thermal paper

910
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,720
on the c5 and this is also a vdl2

911
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,480
product and the reason why i bring that

912
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,360
up is because i'm going to show you guys

913
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,480
the importance of vdl-2 the vhf data

914
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,399
link 2.

915
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,840
not only is it a current system but it's

916
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,640
it's something that

917
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,279
is going to be used as fans fans is uh

918
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,320
the

919
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,360
future aviation navigation system

920
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,200
i believe that's what's called like i

921
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
said the acronyms trip me up too but

922
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,080
it's designed for uh future systems to

923
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,879
be put on

924
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,678
that application layer on top of vdl too

925
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,960
in order to

926
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,120
give us more uh capability as you see

927
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,799
uh the danger that i had before as you

928
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,840
can see when you receive

929
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:37,279
a a car's message it goes across

930
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,879
the ari and c429 so what if you were to

931
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,039
do some injection in there

932
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,360
uh it's not encrypted it's encoded so

933
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,679
what if you were to major maybe put a

934
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,439
a reset a stem in there that's going to

935
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,600
reset a piece of hardware and make that

936
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,960
hardware wait on some software update

937
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,120
even though it wasn't designed that way

938
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
it's still coming from the bus

939
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,879
somebody had mentioned an acl would

940
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,799
probably prevent again this and i end up

941
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,159
all for it but then you have to go back

942
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,840
and have to decide

943
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,200
you know i'm receiving this type of

944
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,199
command from

945
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,399
the acar system should i not be

946
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,919
receiving it and

947
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,360
everything would have to be identified

948
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,720
first so there's a lot of groundwork

949
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,918
that needs to be laid in order for us to

950
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
secure this stuff

951
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,279
so going back vhf data link i wanted to

952
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,158
show you guys what this looks like

953
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,520
there's also a github project out there

954
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,760
that will let you

955
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,639
look at vdl itself and so you can play

956
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,960
around with it

957
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,240
if you like but this is what the layers

958
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,440
look like on it

959
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,120
and everything's going to be built up

960
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,320
there on that application layer all the

961
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,520
new stuff

962
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,360
i wanted you guys to see this because

963
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,639
it's very interesting to sit and look at

964
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,320
this traffic it's one of my favorite

965
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,640
things to play around with

966
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,320
i haven't seen it utilized but there are

967
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,240
ways to deliver a flight plan to the

968
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,760
aircraft via over the air

969
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,600
but once again the air crew has to

970
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,960
validate everything it's not automatic

971
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,199
so they're going to receive a flight

972
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,360
plan and you typically check each of the

973
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,799
each of the legs of it to make sure it

974
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,639
goes where you want to go

975
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,158
uh there's the flight plan stuff that

976
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
i've seen on the military side that's

977
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,399
loaded

978
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,440
they bring the pcmcia cards the hard

979
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,959
drives the

980
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,120
sd cards depending on the hardware

981
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,440
receiver that is built into the airframe

982
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,199
and they have it there they put it in

983
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,520
the aircraft but they still go through

984
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,760
and

985
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,440
check every leg to make sure it's proper

986
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,039
the nice thing is you do have a person

987
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,120
interacting with this you can't just

988
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,158
load it and you know have a bad flight

989
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,918
plan loaded

990
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,760
once again with the i don't know what

991
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,080
the deal is with the airplane mode

992
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,240
because uh as far as i know it just

993
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,960
stops the rf coming from there and okay

994
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,159
so

995
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,559
this is the first time i've gotten this

996
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,120
question but i did ask around

997
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,000
what the airplane mode is so the idea is

998
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,320
that

999
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,760
with rf you have micro voltages micro

1000
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,080
voltages induced along

1001
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,039
along a line the problem is you can have

1002
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,520
a 0.03.01

1003
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,360
volts along a line for navigation

1004
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,960
reasons so when you're landing

1005
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,559
the problem that they're what they're

1006
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,960
afraid of is

1007
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,080
voltages being induced along the antenna

1008
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,799
line

1009
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,879
so that they get a bad vor ils tunnel

1010
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,039
going left right too high too low

1011
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,279
based off people with the cell phones in

1012
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,879
their pockets or right there inducing rf

1013
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,399
but the lines are shielded they're

1014
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,200
designed to be shielded and it's just a

1015
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,199
safety factor

1016
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,240
i get it they also probably want people

1017
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,000
to pay attention

1018
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,760
because taking off and landing is when

1019
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,960
things go wrong and if everybody's

1020
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,440
messing around on their phone then

1021
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,399
you've got your reaction time is delayed

1022
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,520
so that's from what i understand but

1023
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,199
there may be some other people in the

1024
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,600
industry that understand that a little

1025
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,440
a little bit better than i do what tools

1026
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,879
do you use to interpret protocols data

1027
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,159
so this this is where it comes down to

1028
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,679
that maintenance computer

1029
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,360
the maintenance computers themselves

1030
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,320
when you offload everything from a

1031
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,559
flight you can do

1032
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,918
a record of a flight basically and it

1033
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,960
records all the bus data

1034
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,320
and you put that in one of those

1035
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,600
maintenance computers it deciphers

1036
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,399
everything out and spits out a bunch of

1037
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,158
code

1038
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,158
there are possible ways to decipher it

1039
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,080
yourself i haven't written any software

1040
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,600
i've been looking at downloading and

1041
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,240
installing but these are such old

1042
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,000
crappy software it was designed for old

1043
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,279
legacy systems to be installed on i was

1044
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,240
having trouble trying to set up

1045
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,960
something without

1046
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,320
dropping a lot of money try to get a

1047
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,120
base station to play around with the

1048
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,639
protocols

1049
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,120
but it looks like something we may have

1050
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,960
to write and simulate ourselves

1051
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,479
i do believe there might be some stuff

1052
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,840
with some flight simulator software but

1053
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,960
i haven't had a chance to mess with that

1054
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,678
too much

1055
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,440
misdirection and wizard magic tcas

1056
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,679
traffic collision avoidance system this

1057
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,519
is

1058
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,840
one of my favorite systems it's required

1059
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,440
for commercial and cargo aircraft to fly

1060
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,959
uh by faa rules operates with the iff

1061
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,919
transponder

1062
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,559
iff the transponder mode s your traffic

1063
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,480
mode

1064
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,600
and you have a 10 30 megahertz 1090

1065
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,840
megahertz response

1066
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,279
which does the same frequency band as

1067
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,799
you would have iff

1068
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,399
and once again you got the differential

1069
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,399
binary phase shift keyed

1070
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,399
each aircraft has a 24-bit address

1071
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,479
that's established by the transponder

1072
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,320
and it's on this system that's basic

1073
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,840
your breakdown of it this is a ad hoc

1074
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,840
system that was built

1075
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,840
to help with traffic collision avoidance

1076
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,760
it's a really amazing system

1077
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,879
say you have your autopilot keyed off of

1078
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,399
it

1079
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,720
both aircraft do and they're within

1080
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,279
close proximity of each other

1081
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,960
both air crews are going to hear alarms

1082
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,880
in their headsets they're going to have

1083
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,200
notifications all over the place and

1084
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,039
then the aircraft will proceed to

1085
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,480
tell each other which way they're going

1086
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,399
you know be it up or down one will say

1087
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,000
dive one will say climb and they will do

1088
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,000
it adverse to each other

1089
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,760
that prevents collisions in the air

1090
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,799
problem is

1091
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,320
it's not encrypted it's encoded so you

1092
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,760
know imagine what would look like

1093
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,279
if uh if you're on the ground and uh you

1094
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,879
know you were able to send that signal

1095
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,399
up it's a good thing that that signal

1096
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,120
isn't available online for anybody to

1097
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,199
see

1098
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,639
and read and decipher oh yeah that

1099
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,159
this is what it looks like this is your

1100
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,440
pulse your interrogation pulse and your

1101
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,200
response

1102
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,120
now something i didn't know and this is

1103
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,559
silly because of where i come from i

1104
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,158
should have known this but

1105
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,039
in the gps talk that larry pesci was

1106
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,120
talking about

1107
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,240
i had mentioned well doesn't the f the

1108
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,600
fcc see

1109
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,120
bad transmissions and they said well

1110
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,799
that only starts with complaints once

1111
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,879
somebody complains so if you're on the

1112
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,080
ground sending tcas messages up to an

1113
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,799
aircraft up in the air with a

1114
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,439
transmitter

1115
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,879
and it's responding and you can you send

1116
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,679
signals to it because you saw how it was

1117
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,880
built

1118
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,640
so if you have a simulated bus

1119
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,880
sending those signals to the tcas

1120
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,640
computer saying hey i'm this aircraft

1121
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,080
tail number i'm at this altitude which

1122
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,080
normally it gets from

1123
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,960
air pressure the air data computer that

1124
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,639
goes to the mode s transponder

1125
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,000
so you're sending that information to

1126
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,279
the tcas computer unit

1127
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,120
you can make your aircraft seem like

1128
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,640
it's right there in the air and

1129
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,158
put it anywhere around you as long as

1130
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,799
your rf can reach

1131
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,600
that's a very scary thought we uh when

1132
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,760
we would do tests on c-17s with this

1133
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,959
we had to run through the test system

1134
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,799
and the aircraft basically would

1135
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,600
virtually go straight up

1136
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,360
and straight down and we had to do

1137
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,879
certain things to keep the aircraft from

1138
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,320
transmitting rf out of it

1139
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,159
to make it look like because everyone

1140
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,559
else around with this scope sees a

1141
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,760
c17 just do a vert takeoff which of

1142
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,120
course is impossible

1143
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,960
and then come straight back down because

1144
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,918
we were doing the test but yeah so

1145
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,840
there's the

1146
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,360
misdirection of wizard magic as i said

1147
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,600
if you were to sit on the ground and sit

1148
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,840
in this interrogation pull sequence

1149
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,440
and finish the handshake it sends it

1150
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,199
right back you know the pilot could

1151
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,040
easily get a dive dive and there would

1152
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,118
not be anything in front of them

1153
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,399
this system is typically tied into

1154
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,119
autopilot

1155
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,319
but a lot of american manufacturers of

1156
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,000
airframes have

1157
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,200
a pilot override i do know that the idea

1158
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,040
i know the airbus kind of has a

1159
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,078
different concept of the computer has

1160
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,599
the final say

1161
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,359
and i've heard some incidences coming

1162
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,960
from that but i do know that american

1163
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,199
manufacturers tend to have the

1164
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,800
human make the final say so in this case

1165
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,399
they would get to pull up or push down

1166
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,560
but they can override the autopilot but

1167
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,399
still if you're sitting on autopilot

1168
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,399
not doing a whole lot just doing on your

1169
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,159
cruise waiting for your next

1170
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,520
half point to come up and all of a

1171
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,119
sudden you got to dive out of nowhere

1172
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,239
because somebody sends a stem

1173
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,200
so i see that as a very scary thing i'm

1174
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,040
not saying

1175
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,480
it's a hundred percent possible but from

1176
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,359
the information that i have available to

1177
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,119
me this looks

1178
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:04,160
very possible and

1179
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,119
so going back to the vdl as i said with

1180
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,759
a cars and

1181
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,680
cp dlc uh this is just some more stuff

1182
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,200
on the packets what a bdl packet looks

1183
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,560
like it's the same thing with

1184
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,640
your other packets that you have going

1185
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,000
back and forth as i said if you go to

1186
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,839
if you download that project you get a

1187
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,560
good look at it how it works and how it

1188
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,680
functions

1189
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,359
so how was the right way to do it

1190
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,440
i wanted to show this as a preventative

1191
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,799
example this is called link 16 tactical

1192
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,800
digital information link

1193
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,079
this is something the military uses as a

1194
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
battle network when they're flying

1195
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,560
around in the air

1196
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,920
they use a pre-shared key on secret

1197
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,599
hardware devices everything

1198
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,359
nothing ever touches any network except

1199
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,000
for secret networks but they use a

1200
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,440
frequency

1201
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,359
frequency hopping that i was telling you

1202
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,200
about that's a half quick order date

1203
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,960
time of day net number that tells

1204
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,799
when it starts frequency hopping how

1205
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,680
often it frequency hops and

1206
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,119
different nets is like um the set as it

1207
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,720
falls with the set because you can have

1208
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,839
multiple nets on the same frequencies

1209
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,959
because they're just going to be missing

1210
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,440
each other

1211
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,560
frequency range is pretty massive 960 to

1212
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,359
1200 megahertz

1213
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,759
ehf uhf it has limited the line of sight

1214
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,040
but

1215
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,599
we do use satellites on this

1216
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,279
communication network and as you can see

1217
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,920
it's protected because it provides all

1218
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,760
of this

1219
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,480
target data bring the location data

1220
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,920
command and control a mesh network

1221
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,440
you can actually use aircraft to bounce

1222
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,560
signals off of each other in order for

1223
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,680
command and control

1224
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,040
you also have different hardware

1225
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
platforms doing different roles and

1226
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,440
functions

1227
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,118
stuff on the ground all the way up to

1228
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,680
space can space force

1229
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,119
and they can actually issue stuff from

1230
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,200
space or from uh

1231
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,480
aircraft and each aircraft or each

1232
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,040
element on

1233
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,560
the network has their own roles set up

1234
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,320
and with those roles are their limits

1235
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,040
their limits and capabilities based on

1236
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,800
their role

1237
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,079
just like a normal network and i just

1238
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,440
wanted to show you guys

1239
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,960
you know this is i think this is the

1240
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,480
right way to do it mainly with the

1241
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,079
pre-shared key getting into it

1242
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,520
this is all the stuff that's on it this

1243
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,040
is why it's so important

1244
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,119
that it's locked down it's used in

1245
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,359
combat situations stuff and i did

1246
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,960
put reference guide up it's the publicly

1247
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,640
available nato reference guide you guys

1248
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,240
can look throughout that all you want

1249
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,520
i was approached by a few people at one

1250
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,000
conference that actually worked on this

1251
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,280
system

1252
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,119
and i thought that was really cool

1253
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,560
getting to speak with some of them

1254
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,640
and some of the stuff that they put into

1255
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,078
it and of course the vectors and other

1256
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,879
vectors the users

1257
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,320
pilots and maintainers uh zipper suited

1258
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,480
sun gods as we call them and

1259
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,079
us the knuckle draggers because the

1260
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,240
aircraft software updates

1261
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,280
are time sensitive like i told you

1262
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,279
combat dod

1263
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,720
you if you walk up to a right maintainer

1264
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,359
at the right moment they will take

1265
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,640
whatever the

1266
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,279
software they can as long as it's

1267
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,240
properly to load the aircraft

1268
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,760
it's that much pressure chain of custody

1269
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,720
is not always verified in commercial

1270
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,440
products

1271
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,200
it i'm sure there's a policy in place to

1272
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,720
do that because i know that we had one

1273
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,240
but i also know that people try to

1274
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,598
subvert it because they needed something

1275
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,279
fast and we all understand how that

1276
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,040
works and

1277
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,720
pilots are starting to bring personal

1278
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,920
devices to aircraft flight decks this is

1279
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,520
what i was bringing up earlier

1280
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,359
i don't know a whole lot about it i just

1281
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,839
know that i've seen it but i'm on a

1282
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,720
airliner and i know that civilian

1283
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,078
customers

1284
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,000
and now we have the civilian customers

1285
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,160
on the airline network when you

1286
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,040
have the wi-fi and stuff like that uses

1287
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,440
a satcom

1288
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,320
satcom goes across that bus system you

1289
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,760
know you're on the bus

1290
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,760
it's segmented but you're still on that

1291
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,520
same network hacker hurdles

1292
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,680
um as i said this understanding

1293
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,359
understanding aircraft infrastructure

1294
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,118
that is the hurdle i'm trying to give

1295
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,240
you guys some resources so maybe we can

1296
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,520
start going in the right direction in

1297
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,879
order to fix some of these

1298
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,359
understanding specific component

1299
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,760
functions i never realized how much i

1300
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,359
knew

1301
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,400
about aircraft avionics until i started

1302
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,240
talking to people that have never

1303
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,560
touched aircraft avionics systems

1304
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,319
i'm not smart i it's what happens when

1305
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,759
you do something for 18 years

1306
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,520
understanding the functions and how they

1307
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,040
work i found that i could approach a

1308
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,680
network and kind of know exactly what's

1309
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,599
going to go on

1310
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,200
because they there's a lot of

1311
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,359
commonality between the networks the way

1312
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,118
they speak to each other

1313
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,960
and physical access to the hardware

1314
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,720
there's a very high

1315
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,640
paying on this because it's aircraft

1316
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,078
components our dna components and we all

1317
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,240
know those are expensive

1318
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,599
it's a lot like ics components just a

1319
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,279
little bit more expensive because they

1320
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,720
had to be approved by an amazing amount

1321
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,839
of levels and a lot of engineers had to

1322
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,118
be involved to make sure this stuff

1323
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,839
happens

1324
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,520
and then we also have tabletop access to

1325
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,240
software and hardware as i said i've

1326
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,480
tried to get

1327
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,560
access to the software myself yeah

1328
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,920
that's where we stand on that and i did

1329
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,359
have an addendum because i didn't know

1330
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,720
if i'd get to it or not

1331
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,640
last time i didn't get to give my whole

1332
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,799
talk so i was afraid i'd be out of time

1333
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,480
so i have some additional stuff as i

1334
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,400
said with the f-15

1335
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,920
technical assistance database system i

1336
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,280
just wanted to say things are happening

1337
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,200
this is the stuff that's going on now

1338
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,640
these are the things that we're aware of

1339
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,919
i thought it was really cool the stuff

1340
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,279
that i read on that i would love to get

1341
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,119
my hands on that system

1342
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,320
i have a feeling people say it was

1343
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,359
hacked but it

1344
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,200
is a collection of database traffic so i

1345
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,040
can't imagine it being too

1346
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,879
protected but for a hacker to get in

1347
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,800
there you see how simple the

1348
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,240
you do see how simple the communication

1349
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,359
is and it wouldn't be too difficult to

1350
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,279
figure out

1351
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,078
and then the software example the boeing

1352
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,920
737 max ofp i'm not saying it's a hack

1353
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,040
but imagine if they do the update

1354
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,079
because we all know what happened was

1355
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,359
they have the engines

1356
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,200
they move the engines forward when they

1357
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,799
change the type of engines that changes

1358
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,078
your center of gravity on the aircraft

1359
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,200
they did an ofp load the the flight plan

1360
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,200
load in order to

1361
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,118
update the software to make it balance

1362
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,399
it and the software wasn't quite there

1363
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,839
it didn't meet the specs that it needed

1364
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,560
to

1365
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,078
so imagine if they do an update and the

1366
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,839
update comes out and you still manage to

1367
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,440
get a hold of the old legacy system

1368
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,000
if you were to get to the aircraft and

1369
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,680
load the old legacy ofp

1370
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,040
they're going to cause serious system

1371
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,399
problems with that aircraft

1372
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,920
i'm not like you said i'm not saying

1373
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,200
that aircraft was hacked i just wanted

1374
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,000
to present this

1375
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,480
so that you could see a possibility of a

1376
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,480
vector

1377
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,240
us government probes ac volumes they've

1378
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,800
been really big on this lately which is

1379
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,799
great

1380
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,160
i've seen some stuff come out white

1381
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,839
papers about them starting to get into

1382
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,879
it the dod the department of homeland

1383
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,200
security

1384
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,960
i wish luck about looking into

1385
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,319
vulnerabilities and systems and then the

1386
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,440
devices inside a company used for

1387
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,160
programming hardware found to be

1388
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,280
vulnerable

1389
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,560
and infected that's miss becca that's a

1390
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,880
great talk

1391
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,599
when i was talking about the possible

1392
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,280
vectors

1393
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,720
she was presenting to me some of the

1394
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,960
vulnerabilities and

1395
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,919
already induced viruses she found on the

1396
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,680
loading hardware

1397
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,960
loading hardware being that laptop that

1398
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,040
i showed you earlier

1399
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,720
hear all my links for you guys when i

1400
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,079
put the talk up they're all bitly

1401
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,919
because i i'm kind of

1402
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,440
trying to engage where i am in this and

1403
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,760
i want to see what people are interested

1404
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,520
in

1405
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,440
and i want to make my talk go more that

1406
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,240
direction and i apologize for any audio

1407
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,400
issues

1408
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,160
i thought it was all sorted out and also

1409
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,599
for showing you guys my desktop

1410
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,759
even though i'm a psychopath and keep

1411
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,760
everything organized but are there any

1412
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,880
additional questions we've got about

1413
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,680
13 minutes so the um you're asking what

1414
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
data the

1415
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,359
black boxes keep a copy of this is

1416
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,680
actually kind of cool that goes back to

1417
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,759
the

1418
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,078
um you have a digital flight data

1419
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,680
recorder and a cockpit voice recorder

1420
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,760
and so cockpit voice recorder always

1421
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,118
records the last 30 minutes i think they

1422
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,599
may have increased it but

1423
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,160
the old school version was the last 30

1424
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,079
minutes

1425
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,440
of the flight at all times it just had a

1426
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,359
tape that kept going over

1427
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,680
now with digital stuff they can do more

1428
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,400
you have area cockpits that pick up area

1429
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,078
mics

1430
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,359
and you also have the radio it's going

1431
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,920
to pick up everything along the radio

1432
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,119
bus

1433
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,800
and then you have your digital flight

1434
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,400
data recorder digital flight data

1435
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,040
recorder is going to record all your nav

1436
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,000
stuff there's a video of a c5 crashing

1437
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,599
at dover

1438
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and it is a um it's a video of

1439
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,040
the digital flight data recorder stuff

1440
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,640
so you could see their

1441
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,240
throttle positions you could see what

1442
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,040
engine was functioning which engine was

1443
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,640
not functioning

1444
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,560
their navigation and then they actually

1445
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,480
created a 3d model of it landing

1446
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,920
crashing crew lid which is great but

1447
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,920
it's a it's a great way to see what kind

1448
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,880
of information is recorded on that

1449
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,560
um any more questions the one that i i

1450
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,000
like juicebox asked us and i think a lot

1451
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,560
of people ask this question but

1452
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
does airplane mode do anything if i turn

1453
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,279
it on or leave it off will it impact

1454
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,640
anything on the airplane

1455
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,920
now that's that's what i could that's

1456
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,440
another one of those things i can say

1457
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,319
from my understanding

1458
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,160
so i know that nav systems as i said

1459
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,520
earlier the nav systems have a very low

1460
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,359
voltage deviation

1461
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,720
and so the idea is that the rf from your

1462
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,960
phone is going to induce

1463
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,480
voltages along those lines and because

1464
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,880
the voltages are so low

1465
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,400
if the idea is that you can induce the

1466
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,520
voltages and those lines run the entire

1467
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,400
length of the aircraft so

1468
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,920
say you have a dor ils antenna at the

1469
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,119
front of the aircraft the box may be

1470
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,079
midway down so you're going to have

1471
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,520
those wires run

1472
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,520
and then up to the cockpit to the bus

1473
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,520
system to give them their visual display

1474
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,560
so the idea is to keep from inducing

1475
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,400
voltages

1476
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,759
on there and also as i said if you have

1477
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,480
an emergency it's going to be on takeoff

1478
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,079
and landing

1479
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,520
the last thing you want is that half

1480
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,480
second delay of somebody trying to react

1481
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,240
to an emergency

1482
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,839
and i get that this is from what i

1483
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,040
understand though i also know that those

1484
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,040
wires are

1485
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,040
grounded and they're you know very well

1486
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,520
protected against rf because an aircraft

1487
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,800
is

1488
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,359
ridiculously noisy mainframed

1489
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,319
767 asked what are pilots opinions on

1490
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,240
some of these hacks

1491
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,599
or did they just shrug it off and go oh

1492
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,240
looks like t

1493
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,079
uh t-sass is busted and just fix it and

1494
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,439
then shut it off and walk away

1495
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,599
it's maintenance's problem that's that's

1496
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,480
i hate to say it but i actually have an

1497
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,119
example of

1498
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,400
when we were in syria we had and i can

1499
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,680
talk about this because it's public

1500
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,560
knowledge and i even mentioned this in

1501
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,879
another talk

1502
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,560
syria was one of the most crazy areas

1503
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,119
for defensive avionics systems just

1504
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,680
being

1505
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,200
bombarded with rf so we'd launch a plane

1506
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,799
and come back radios are broken

1507
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,879
radios work fine launch it come back

1508
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,560
radios are broken radios work fine

1509
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,599
and it kept falling on us they're like

1510
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,040
well guys there's something wrong with

1511
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,240
the radios we want you to change parts

1512
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,079
like look there's nothing wrong with

1513
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,799
your radios and i actually had to go and

1514
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,319
find

1515
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,000
the excerpt from the general to go look

1516
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,920
guys you're getting bombarded

1517
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,280
with rf it's so then it comes back to a

1518
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,800
communication issue with here

1519
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,560
like you say if you have a tcas issue

1520
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,319
like that if it happens

1521
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,680
once it happens twice when you start

1522
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,480
getting repeat write-ups

1523
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,919
that's when they're really going to

1524
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,040
start taking notice on it because

1525
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,319
there's going to be a lot of pressure on

1526
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,920
maintenance and then they can start

1527
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,560
including aircrew in it to find that

1528
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,480
problem

1529
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,078
problem is there's a lag there so you

1530
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,200
know if you've got if it's happening 20

1531
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,400
30 times

1532
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,000
and you're not even addressing it till

1533
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,000
then there could be a problem do you

1534
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,640
think a lot of the security around this

1535
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,079
or lack thereof is just because it's so

1536
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,400
hard to get a hold of the equipment it's

1537
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,920
not

1538
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,920
like you can just go down to walmart buy

1539
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,400
it and then take it apart at home

1540
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,760
oh yeah that's 100 that's why i have

1541
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,680
that slide it's

1542
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,680
it is almost impossible to get a hold of

1543
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,000
this equipment it's expensive

1544
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,720
because of what it is and then on top of

1545
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,960
that

1546
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,040
setting up the stuff requires very

1547
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,560
specific set of skills

1548
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,839
like you have to basically hire these

1549
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,960
engineers to come in and set it up and

1550
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,000
it's just because the knowledge base

1551
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,520
isn't out there

1552
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,960
and i think it's important that a lot of

1553
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,119
this stuff gets out there it's a lot

1554
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,200
simpler than a lot of people think it is

1555
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,960
and um i i just think it's important

1556
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,319
that people understand that and see it

1557
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,240
go oh wow this is what these packets

1558
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,960
look like it's not really that bad

1559
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,200
it's just deviations and voltages so

1560
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,000
with all of this like do you feel like

1561
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,919
i mean it seems like with airplanes the

1562
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,319
more complicated the airplane gets

1563
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,079
the more accident prone and the more

1564
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:44,560
difficult it is to maintain

1565
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,520
so do you see that as technology

1566
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,839
actually becomes

1567
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,520
a problem in this scenario far more than

1568
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,759
an actual solution

1569
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,720
well the the thing is you still have to

1570
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,720
um yeah

1571
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,759
with aircraft avionics and the way their

1572
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,359
networks are set up

1573
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,480
they still follow the keep it simple

1574
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:02,160
stupid method as simple as they can

1575
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,920
so yeah even though you're introducing a

1576
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,520
lot of other systems you're going to try

1577
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,800
to keep it as simple as possible we have

1578
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,319
a lot of fallback

1579
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,400
say for instance if you have a power

1580
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,839
reset you have a 28 volt battery that

1581
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,520
can run a lot of things you even have a

1582
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,040
thing called a ram air turbine

1583
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,720
that pops out the side of the aircraft

1584
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,160
and spins from the airflow

1585
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,000
to cause a little bit of voltage and

1586
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,879
keep the hydro going and then they can

1587
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,359
run off of

1588
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,680
hardwire after that say the bus crashes

1589
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,279
your pilot your main pilot radio has a

1590
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,160
backup that's hardwired directly to the

1591
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,079
rt

1592
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,279
so as i said it's a fail to open thing

1593
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,839
because of safety

1594
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,599
and you go back to that simplicity it

1595
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,759
makes things run a lot smoother but we

1596
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,440
we still need we've added so many

1597
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,800
networks and there's so much traffic and

1598
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,319
there's so much new capabilities

1599
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,240
aircraft i think it's a necessity to

1600
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,160
keep bumping up to those complex it

1601
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,078
the complexities but i think that we

1602
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,040
need to it's the same problem you have

1603
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,359
with the old

1604
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,640
you know when um the dod came out with

1605
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,200
the internet originally you know it's

1606
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,598
not

1607
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,720
inherently secure so you have to build

1608
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,920
everything on top of it

1609
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,279
so the same thing you have with the old

1610
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,160
bus systems they're not inherently

1611
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,000
secure

1612
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,279
same thing with like i said the v edl

1613
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,640
vhf datalink

1614
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,119
a lot of the future stuff is going to be

1615
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,040
based off of that but that itself is

1616
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,480
it's pretty spoofable and maintenance

1617
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,279
can be done in the air i've had to do

1618
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,359
that before

1619
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,560
depends on the system i have done radio

1620
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,480
resets in the air

1621
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,000
uh that goes back to a fallback system

1622
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,680
because you're asking it can make this

1623
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,280
be done on the ground or in the air and

1624
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,118
yes it can it just depends on the system

1625
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,960
i mean obviously i've seen

1626
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,559
engine restarts in the air too try to

1627
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,760
fix something and sometimes it works

1628
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,760
but it's it depends on your your risk

1629
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,200
costs you know you're going to do well

1630
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,160
and i think that that might have

1631
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,919
something to do

1632
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,359
be a little bit different between like a

1633
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,040
military type flight

1634
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,960
or even like a weather flight versus a

1635
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,680
commercial flight with 400 people on the

1636
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
flying

1637
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,200
you might be willing to do different

1638
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,680
things in those situations

1639
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,520
and as for spacex stuff i have been

1640
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,118
speaking with a few people

1641
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,559
that do rocket stuff i don't know a lot

1642
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,760
of the systems but i've been talking to

1643
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,040
them about radios

1644
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,119
simply because i'm just trying to figure

1645
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,520
out how their stuff works i know that

1646
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,760
buses are common but i know that rockets

1647
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,440
you have a weight thing that is a lot

1648
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,839
the cost per weight is so much higher

1649
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,359
that they

1650
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,000
they kind of make their own solution for

1651
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,640
a lot of stuff well thank you so much

1652
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,240
fantastic talk and i hope to get you

1653
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,960
back at wild west hack and fest in

1654
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,000
deadwood

1655
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,720
if we're actually still doing

1656
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,319
conferences at that point in the future

1657
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,839
i i don't doubt you will be and thanks

1658
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,200
again for the opportunity john i really

1659
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,558
appreciate it

1660
