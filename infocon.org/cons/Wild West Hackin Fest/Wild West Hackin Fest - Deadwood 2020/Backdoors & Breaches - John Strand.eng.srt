1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,740
a couple of quick things this was

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:08,290
supposed to be a short talk because how

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,940
this was supposed to be happening was we

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,480
were supposed to be out at like dinner

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,190
and we were supposed to be on a boat

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,280
without gonna pay floppiness and are we

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,200
needing ease or whatever and I was

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,970
supposed to be handing out at this point

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,369
a whole bunch of copies and backdoors

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,439
and breeches for everybody and then give

11
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,210
a quick overview of backdoors and

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,570
breaches for people that aren't familiar

13
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,829
with it so I will get two back doors and

14
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,870
breaches here in a couple of minutes and

15
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,450
we'll talk about the card game but

16
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,339
before we do I want to kind of reinforce

17
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,460
a couple of points I made before Joff

18
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,720
presented and once again we're extremely

19
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,360
happy that you all are here I would also

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,579
ask that if you have any questions or

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,980
any comments please use the discord

22
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,480
channel we have GoToWebinar and that's

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,739
great we've got questions and all of

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,140
those things and I know that you're all

25
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,599
used to doing that and that's fine for

26
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,239
standard wild-west hacking fast stuff

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,469
though we want to use discord mainly

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,249
because we want to make this a community

29
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:11,439
event as much as we possibly can I did

30
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:14,469
want to call out a couple of different

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,059
groups really quickly because we have

32
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:18,279
some sponsors that really were

33
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,350
supportive of everything that we have

34
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:26,740
done and the first one I would like to

35
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:28,929
call out is psy and scythe is just some

36
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,359
some of the coolest people that we've

37
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:33,670
worked with and it does a lot more than

38
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,098
just your your threat emulation platform

39
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,499
but be sure to check out how you can

40
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:41,619
actually do like more tighter and more

41
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:43,509
accurate mapping to the miter attack

42
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:45,520
technique matrix as an example and

43
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:46,899
emulate what an attacker would do that's

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,520
great and we really like threat

45
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,590
emulation because if we can get that 80%

46
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,469
taken off the table before a pen tester

47
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:57,489
shows up that would be great and the

48
00:01:53,469 --> 00:02:01,770
other group is open sec and with atomic

49
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:01,770
attack it's not open secrets open sack

50
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:12,920
so open sack is it's a mat to Sainz

51
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,110
company and I you know it's kind of hard

52
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,940
where's their open sack open SEC should

53
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:25,100
be shooting me that link what is open

54
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:25,850
SEC org waiting for a link to pop up

55
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:31,700
intern ain't right

56
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:33,769
they are also just fantastic and and

57
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,190
Matt is one of those former employees

58
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,540
that I miss horribly there's no way I'll

59
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,240
ever get it back because they remember

60
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,810
whatever Matt left be H is to start his

61
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,640
own company

62
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,950
I remember saying dude you're

63
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,359
unemployable and for me at this point

64
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,179
whenever I say that somebody is

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,240
unemployable it's probably the biggest

66
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,740
it's probably the biggest possible

67
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:01,880
compliment that I can give anybody so

68
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:04,940
let's go open security oh I oh and there

69
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,680
we go so open security and it's kind of

70
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,540
funny whenever we're talking about these

71
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,220
different companies it's like trust it's

72
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,989
SEC we look Trust at sex everybody

73
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,560
pioneer defense they're great trust it

74
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:18,800
sec what is trusted SEC was checking my

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,100
recent downloads oh my god so I can go

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,330
through all of this dude oh my god

77
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,880
that's embarrassing let me explain okay

78
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,770
so open security is fantastic and the

79
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,299
best way to say it is open security as a

80
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,150
competitor of Black Hills information

81
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,239
security

82
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,790
and then trusted sack is a great

83
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,560
fantastic supporter of wild was hacking

84
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,359
fest and they're a competitor of Black

85
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,200
Hills information security same thing

86
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,900
within guardians and much of other

87
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,578
companies in in and I know that that's

88
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,870
weird right like if you're looking at

89
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,819
renditions and we talked about our

90
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,680
competitors and we try to kind of put up

91
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,328
our competitors and open security being

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,730
a huge partner of this conference as a

93
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:02,769
whole but it isn't and and the reason

94
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,929
why I want to make it very clear that it

95
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:08,859
isn't easy need to understand that

96
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,510
there's very few of us right now in this

97
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,760
industry that are small security

98
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,620
pentesting firms that are trying to do

99
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,060
the absolute best thing that we possibly

100
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,269
can for the community I don't throw Krim

101
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,220
in with this as well so big thanks to

102
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,990
all of those because remember if we

103
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,210
don't continue to push and do what we're

104
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,669
doing here with conferences and small

105
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,888
security firms and defining what red

106
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,960
teaming is and defining what pentesting

107
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,630
is and working with companies like brim

108
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,020
with open security within Guardians with

109
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,630
rendition secure ideas then honestly the

110
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,159
big players the big five consulting

111
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,039
companies they're gonna define it for us

112
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,840
and we don't want that to happen and I

113
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,320
think that that also leads a little bit

114
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,960
into why we're going to a virtual

115
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,820
platform for this conference probably

116
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,888
would have been a lot easier for us to

117
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,349
see you all know probably would have

118
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:03,340
been a lot easier for us just to simply

119
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:04,389
go just to simply go and cancel the

120
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,280
conference if we would have got to

121
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:09,789
cancel we could have invoked force

122
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,349
majeure with the hotel and they would

123
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,919
have had to refund all of the down

124
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:13,030
payment

125
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,830
we wouldn't vote then absolutely

126
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,919
anything at all and we could have walked

127
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,070
away fairly cleanly I didn't want to do

128
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,859
that it out yesterday that we lost about

129
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,750
a hundred thousand dollars by taking

130
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,010
this conference virtual and that has to

131
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,570
do with the hotels whenever you're

132
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,340
setting up a conference and in a hotel

133
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,340
you basically tell them that you're

134
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,020
going to fill 450 rooms and if you meet

135
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,638
that then great then you don't know the

136
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,698
money but if you don't meet that then

137
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:43,180
you owe them money and honestly we

138
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:45,159
really didn't want to we didn't want to

139
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,240
make the conference go away so we ended

140
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:49,030
up paying

141
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,430
or that now let me explain why if you

142
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,109
look at computer security conferences

143
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,199
computer security conferences are the

144
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,520
lifeblood of this industry I know a lot

145
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,410
of people like to rip on security

146
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,000
conferences and say things like well

147
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,680
it's all garbage it's a bunch of people

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,060
stroking their own egos I don't like

149
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,130
going to conferences it's too crowded

150
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,520
it's too noisy and all of those things

151
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,229
are somewhat true but I think it

152
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,169
marginalizes the amazing things that

153
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:16,210
come out of conferences new cutting-edge

154
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:18,130
research sharing techniques that

155
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,840
actually work you see the people that

156
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,250
we're going up against the adversaries

157
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,448
they're sharing information all the time

158
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,639
they're innovating all of the time and

159
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,919
if we lose the ability to actually

160
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,690
communicate with each other be in the

161
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,090
form of webcasts or be in the form of

162
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,590
conferences like this one then I really

163
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,880
believe that the adversaries that we

164
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,729
deal with are going to get an advantage

165
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,919
on us and it's going to impact security

166
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,330
moving forward so this is important this

167
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,889
is the lifeblood this is the way that we

168
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,289
share information across the entire

169
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:50,590
community as well so that's why we took

170
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:53,740
it virtual I expected to lose our ass on

171
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,479
this and the community reacted in a way

172
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,770
that we did not expect whenever we

173
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,300
announced that we were going to be

174
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,419
switching virtual we were expecting a

175
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,300
wave of cancellations and a wave of

176
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:05,889
refund requests for the training and for

177
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,750
the delivery of this conference and that

178
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,000
did not happen

179
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,340
in fact since we announced that we were

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,860
going to go extrude exclusively virtual

181
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,280
we have sold over a hundred and nine

182
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,750
additional tickets for this conference

183
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,359
because the support of the community has

184
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:26,259
just been that strong and that amazing

185
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,479
as Dan just pointed out he says you

186
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,759
can't ditch us so easily and that's

187
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,068
absolutely true it's absolutely true and

188
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,210
it's been a little bit overwhelming

189
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,759
especially with everything being

190
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,280
uncertain so as I said this was meant to

191
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,289
be a dinner thing at dinner card game

192
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,340
Murrow was gonna explain the card decks

193
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,479
and how it was going to work we're gonna

194
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,729
stick with that I'm not actually gonna

195
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,440
go through and play a game for two

196
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,110
reasons one it doesn't work very well on

197
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,550
cameras the other reason is all the

198
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,129
people that have been here been working

199
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,620
all day keeping the training absolutely

200
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:58,250
moving along smoothly and that just went

201
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,300
really really well

202
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:04,909
so I can't give you cards I was going to

203
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,280
give everyone card see our goal is to

204
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:09,620
break even with backdoors and breaches

205
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,150
and sometimes we're successful about

206
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,889
that sometimes we're not because you

207
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,919
guys keep buying the damn things on

208
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,900
Amazon and we sold out again every time

209
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,520
we sell out on Amazon we sound like

210
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,590
another three four thousand we're like

211
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,810
that's it they're not gonna sell out

212
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,659
this time and they sell out again so

213
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,830
these things are in demand and you can

214
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,319
get them for free any conference that

215
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,669
we're at so I can't give you cards

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,959
virtually I just can't give it to you

217
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,208
through the camera and have you pull it

218
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:39,439
out like lawnmower man on the other side

219
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:42,439
or Tron but I can announce tonight we've

220
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,570
been scrambling with logistics laura is

221

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,860
link where they can provide their

227
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,870
physical address and whenever they

228
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,940

234
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,089
conferences as well and just you know we

235
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,390
will be decontaminating lots of hand

236
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:21,050
sanitizer I couldn't buy bunny suits for

237
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,490
putting the schwag bags together but we

238
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,529
will be doing our best to decontaminate

239
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,480
the area that we're gonna create the

240
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:29,329
swag bags for all the attendees as well

241
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,220
sure schwag is happening folks you will

242
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:33,829
be getting a free copy of backdoors and

243
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,120
breaches so I wanted to talk a little

244
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:37,489
bit about the game and I have it up on

245
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,980
my screen right now backdoors and

246
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,540
breaches and how it's actually created

247
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,000
and

248
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,069
and what we're doing with this as well

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,420
so this brought to you by Black Hills

countermeasures as always so the looking

252
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,209
for Han teaming or pentesting you know

253
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:58,519
what at this point we're pen testing go

254
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:01,758
check out our sponsors pH is we're doing

255

great we appreciate all that you do but

256
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,569
yeah that was absolutely you have a lawn

257
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:06,979
mower Man reference awesome well of

258
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:09,410
course Jeff did Jeff is sharing with

259
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,449
everyone else but check out our sponsors

260
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,980
if we're gonna lose work we want to make

261
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,810
sure that we lose work to people who are

262
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,670
awesome and the pen testing firms that

263
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,589
are sponsoring are awesome people to

264
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,360
work with so so let's talk about

265
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,339
backdoors and breaches now the reason

266
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,759
why we created backdoors and breaches is

267
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:28,880
because tabletops are traditionally just

268
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:31,160
not fun you're absolutely miserable to

269
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,720
sit through because the scenarios are

270
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,279
usually drafted up and it's like this

271
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,139
stuffy person gets up there with arm

272
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,939
patches on their coats and they're like

273
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:41,000
alright so eight o'clock on Monday

274
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,980
morning no we have a virus outbreak

275
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,180
under network so what do we do and

276
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,100
everybody just kind of sits around the

277
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,649
room and they kind of look at each other

278
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,329
and they're like I don't know why am I

279
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,459
here and of course there's the one

280
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:53,930
security guy who's frustrated that he

281
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,160
has to be there or she has to be there

282
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,750
because they have real work to do and

283
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,189
like well we do this procedure this

284
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,449
procedure this procedure and then

285
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,940
there's some other person they're almost

286
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:04,010
like well could we see those procedures

287
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:08,420
and maybe go through those it's just

288
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:13,639
like my eyes are bleeding just

289
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:17,449
absolutely horrible so man thanks dude

290
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:19,639
already you got it done in one so Ron's

291
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:21,469
making me laugh like right out of the

292
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,930
bat so this disc or channel thing is

293
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,430
going to be a mistake I'm gonna have you

294
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,250
you better be careful I won't watch

295
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,739
discord at all so with back with

296
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,569
tabletop exercises they're miserable the

297
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,079
scenarios are incomplete or they're

298
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:38,149
nonsensical scenarios that are not

299
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:40,219
real-world scenarios they're really like

300
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,930
magical unicorn attacks they're things

301
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,480
like well let's say that somebody finds

302
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:47,180
a zero day in our firewall and they hack

303
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,939
our firewall or they'll be somebody that

304
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,829
watches CSI and you know they're like

305
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:53,329
what if somebody's using JavaScript see

306
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,250
if you guys can find this reference okay

307
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,229
if you can find this reference

308
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,090
but up in the discord channel let's see

309
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,830
if they can let's see if an attacker

310
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,200
what would happen if an attacker was

311
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,210
hacking our firewall using JavaScript

312
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,590
and we needed to stop that see if you

313
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,300
can find that video and post it for

314
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,240
everybody and those are the scenarios

315
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,680
that we actually walk through so we

316
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,200
needed to come up with something that

317
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,849
was different so the scenario is and how

318
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,330
this I actually kind of built on itself

319
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,910
was originally there was cubicles and

320
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:26,000
compromises right in cubicles and

321
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:28,790
compromises was a game that was a DND

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,400
style game for incident response but it

323
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,160
didn't have a lot of structure was pure

324
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,160
role-playing and pure D&D style stuff

325
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,079
right and it was great I love cubicles

326
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,180
and compromises but the problem was you

327
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,180
can only play cubicles and compromises

328
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,459
if you had an incident master or a

329
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,459
dungeon master that was extremely

330
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:53,690
proficient in information security

331
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:55,760
so @bh is we would see all the different

332
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,590
people that would do it and it would be

333
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,030
like Java could do it I could do it but

334
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,910
then if we had somebody that hadn't been

335
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,100
doing it for as many years as Jeff and I

336
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,930
have been doing it they would kind of

337
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,880
flounder and then the game would kind of

338
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,560
fall apart it would collapse onto itself

339
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,689
and then would start sucking everything

340
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,640
in the room into this vortexes suck and

341
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,260
then create a singularity that had to be

342
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,290
cordoned off it was that bad it was like

343
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,700
a black hole of awfulness so we wanted

344
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,920
to create some more structure with that

345
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,640
so I started thinking about that a while

346
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,740
ago and then Jason came up with an idea

347
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,319
Jason Blanchard whenever he was still at

348
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,470
the SANS Institute came up with an idea

349
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,380
of creating a game that would be like

350
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:39,470
almost like Candyland and really it was

351
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,350
basically a hacker Candyland and it was

352
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,000
called pivots and payloads so he kind of

353
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,370
had this idea in his head as a

354
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,830
conceptual framework of a pivots and

355
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,140
payloads game like Candyland or if you

356
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,240
roll and you land on you know successful

357
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,430
recon jump to exploitation phase and

358
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,350
then oh they detected you go back to the

359
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,359
recon phase and you kind of move around

360
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,980
this game with all these different

361
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,360
things so he came to me and he was

362
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,430
talking about he's like I don't know if

363
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,110
this is gonna work I don't know how this

364
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,069
would go and I still have the

365
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,560
spreadsheet of the

366
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,350
different tack paths that actually made

367
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,300
up the initial pivots and payload so I

368
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,220
still have that spreadsheet that I sent

369
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,930
to Jason and a lot of that actually made

370
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,730
it into the final game and of course

371
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,250
people like Larry Pesci and Ed SCOTUS

372
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,900
contributed to it as well once again

373
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:29,160
it's kind of hard to make that portable

374
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,709
so fast forward to RS a couple of years

375
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,060
ago and I was at RSA and there was a

376
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,100
vendor there that was handing out

377
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,099
playing card standard playing cards and

378
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,430
each playing card had a different apt

379
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,610
group or malware specimen actually let's

380
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,920
just see it box whopper nailed it box

381
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,930
off forgot my JavaScript firewall

382
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,949
hacking reference well done

383
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:55,050
so I was at the RSA boot for this

384
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,550
company from China and all these cards

385
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,050
at different apt groups and all these

386
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,370
different things and then I got to

387
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,870
thinking well we could do that with

388
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,090
active countermeasures put malware

389
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,430
beacons on the cards and what would be

390
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,080
the attribute of the malware and then I

391
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,760
realized logistically what happened is

392
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,280
almost every malware beacon that we

393
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,770
looked at through a hunter had the exact

394
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,300
same damn connection profile trip so it

395
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,300
was the most boring set of cards that

396
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,120
ever existed and started talking about

397
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,449
it with Jason really Jason was my

398
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,590
support group for this entire thing and

399
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,360
he was like what if you could create a

400
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,010
card game and it was kind of the phases

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,350
of the attack and all these different

402
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,610
things and while he was kind of talking

403
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,350
about it because all these good ideas

404
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,360
come from Jason it's like wait a minute

405
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,160
this could be what we do with cubicles

406
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,890
and compromises but it actually builds

407
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,020
the attack so I actually have a deck of

408
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,939
cards that I just opened up and this is

409
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:49,110
one of the most satisfying things in my

410
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:51,750
life I get a deck of cards and it has

411
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,210
the paper or the plastic on it I get to

412
00:15:51,750 --> 00:16:12,810
open it it's like oh yes what's that

413
00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:14,460
ASMR sorry it's just getting weird all

414
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,569
right it's been a long couple of days

415
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:20,400
folks and so now I've got the deck of

416
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,080
cards so I'm gonna go through the decks

417
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,870
of cards

418
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,580
here in just a little bit so the state

419
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,680
of play whenever you're setting this up

420
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,570
is you're gonna have the incident master

421
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,609
that's kind of the dungeon master that's

422
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,320
going to be handing out and it's just

423
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,670
creepy it's not relaxing at all

424
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,500
whatsoever Oh heavy key so you have the

425
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,630
Institut master that drives the game and

426
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,940
builds the game dynamically and they

427
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,439
make it it's a determination as to

428
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,850
whether or not the different defensive

429
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,860
tactics and techniques that are being

430
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,890
employed by the vendors would be

431
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,210
successful or not so that's the incident

432
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,430
master and they still have to have a

433
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,650
really good understanding of the attacks

434
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,719
I've actually heard of a number of

435
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,939
people that before they play the

436
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,800
incident master role actually go to each

437
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,630
of the cards and I'll talk about what's

438
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,089
on the cards here in a little bit but

439
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:11,480
they'll go to each of the cards and they

440
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:13,339
will study before they play the incident

441
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,450
master role so they learn about all

442
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,619
these different attacks and all these

443
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:19,370
different things and that's absolutely

444
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:22,520
just fantastic for us now the players

445
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:24,919
the defenders they draw for procedure

446
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,470
cards now there's a competitive variant

447
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,990
of backdoors and breaches that involves

448
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:32,090
using two decks of cards where people

449
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,010
play against each other we won't talk

450
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,840
about that here but I had a web cast

451
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,740
where we did that but it involves money

452
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:43,459
and cost and also the expansion pack

453
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,710
that is going to be probably the demo

454
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,630
release at Wild West hacking fest which

455
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,740
is like six months away so I better get

456
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,740
to work on that right away

457
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,810
and then 20 21 is when the full

458
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,700
expansion pack is going to be hitting

459
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,220
four back doors and breaches so it's

460
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,140
coming out here in just a little bit so

461
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,520
the players draw procedures cards and

462
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,810
we'll talk about the procedure cards and

463
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,320
what they actually do here a little bit

464
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,010
later

465
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,080
now the dice they get rolled and

466
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,180
basically every single action the

467
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,179
success or failure is determined by the

468
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,040
rule itself so if it's 11 and over then

469
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,500
the action is successful if it's 10 and

470
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,690
lower then it fails if you have the

471
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,450
procedure card for that action that you

472
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,220
want to take then you get a +3 modifier

473
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,640
and this is to highlight the importance

474
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:31,730
of actually having procedures in your

475
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,520
organization to deal with Incident

476
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,940
Response as well as I said it has DMD

477
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,160
roots

478
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,560
folks the goal is to build up

479
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,180
conversations to talk about attacks

480
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,530
it's about tracking any missing

481
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,660
procedures or things that you think

482
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,860
would be very very helpful for incident

483
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,060
response and then kind of walking

484
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,030
through how you'd handle these issues

485
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,250
and I don't know the math but there's a

486
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,320
large combination if you look at the

487
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,030
cards we have red yellow purple and

488
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,159
brown cards you would draw one of each

489
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,170
of those cards and there's a large

490
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,510
number of possible combinations of

491
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,690
attacks that can be incorporated in this

492
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:08,930
game so it gives a really really nice

493
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,580
variation to the tabletop exercises and

494
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,500
adds in some randomness and some

495
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,500
corrected action with backdoors and

496
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,390
breaches as well all right so let me

497
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,180
break down a card for you so every

498
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:23,450
single card has the overall title of

499
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,760
that card and it will say okay this

500
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,830
title of this card is a phishing attack

501
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,100
and then it has some overall text of

502
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:34,490
what that particular attack is like and

503
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:37,159
then it breaks down suggested D text now

504
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,900
the suggested detection becomes really

505
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,910
important and competitive back doors and

506
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,160
breaches because you're building your

507
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,290
detection deck and buying attack cards

508
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,390
and defense cards and the detection

509
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,550
cards are the ones that you have to try

510
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,440
that activity to flip this card back

511
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:54,050
over so it's really really really cool

512
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,030
and then tools now the tools are

513
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:58,520
important because sharing open source

514
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:01,490
tools for the purposes of training

515
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,290
people and maybe wargaming this live in

516
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,180
your environment it's kind of a red team

517
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,550
before a red team is critical so you

518
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,800
could have things like evil engine X you

519
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:11,480
have Go Fish you have cred sniper and

520
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,970
then we also have links to different

521
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,650
articles and tools that you can walk

522
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,870
through or blogs that you can go through

523
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,910
that'll teach you how to do that now I

524
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,770
want to walk through the initial

525
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,540
compromised parts the initial

526
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,190
compromised cards are how the attacker

527
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,800
got in the environment in the first

528
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,470
place and the initial compromised cards

529
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,970
are credential stuffing that's where the

530
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,770
attacker I'm going to bring up my camera

531
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,020
so I can make sure I'm showing the card

532
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,090
correctly so we have credential stuffing

533
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,770
the credential stuffing card is

534
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,139
basically where you have breached

535
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:45,170
credentials online and people are using

536
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,420
them against you exploitable external

537
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,640
service on your environment

538
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,620
bring your own exploited device now so

539
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,540
many people are really big into BYOD

540
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,870
bringing your own exploited device

541
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,940
social engineering as you know from pen

542
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:02,330
testing awesome that's usually the

543
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:05,030
easiest way to get in exploiting a trust

544
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,620
relationship talking about China it's

545
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,030
very regular we have companies that are

546
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,010
like so we're starting up a Chinese

547
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,600
office and we want to know what's the

548
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,910
best way to secure ourselves from the

549
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,540
Chinese office we're like great cut the

550
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:20,870
wire password spring right password

551
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,310
spring insider threat do you have an

552
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,790
insider threat that's doing something

553
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:29,750
malicious in your environment as well

554
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:32,300
and then here we've got external cloud

555
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,370
access so if somebody is using something

556
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,740
like cred king or they're using domain

557
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,840
password spray excuse me password

558
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,660
spraying toolkit from might be leader in

559
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,780
marchello Oh a web server compromised to

560
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,310
basically pop in to your environment

561
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,570
through a web server then of course

562
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,550
phishing which we have already talked

563
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,710
about so those are the cards that cover

564
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:54,680
initial compromised how somebody would

565
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,620
break into your environment in the first

566
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,240
place so that's pretty fun now if we're

567
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,300
trying to chain together the attack we

568
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,250
also have pivot and escalate now as part

569
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,930
of creating this game I wanted to make

570
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,570
sure that I broke the attack phases down

571
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:12,290
to just four stick phases and that is

572
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:14,600
probably one of the I would say that

573
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,570
that's one of the critiques of this game

574
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:21,439
is we didn't set up the attack phase for

575
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:24,050
like recon scanning exploitation lateral

576
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,610
movement you know maintaining act we

577
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,960
didn't actually follow the sands

578
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,030
methodology because it would have been

579
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,280
too many cards so we kind of clumped a

580
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,440
little bit more than we could then we

581
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,129
should have as well all right so here we

582
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,320
go Rick said drink every time John says

583
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,420
exploit compromised is mentioned okay

584
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,060
well here we go let's see how many times

585
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,880
I can say exploit and compromise so here

586
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,950
we have internal password spray and

587
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,240
that's very similar to password spray on

588
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,400
the outside of the environment for

589
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,040
initial compromise but remember we can

590
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,130
also use password spraying for lateral

591
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,170
movement right so we can basically take

592
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,110
our attack and then start password

593
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,740
spraying

594
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,240
with tools like domain password spread

595
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,210
internally to try to identify additional

596
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,940
accounts with passwords like winter 2019

597
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,350
so Tim Adeem how to tweet it said what's

598
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,900
the simplest hack you've ever pulled off

599
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:19,260
our witness we've had a DA account with

600
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,390
winter 2019 multi-factor bypass by just

601
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,740
skipping the login page what are some of

602
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,600
the ones that you have so if you guys

603
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,130
want to put some of those in as part of

604
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,770
the conference that would be awesome

605
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:31,410
as well so kind of get rolling with Tim

606
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,720
Bodines stuff that Jeff McJunkin put out

607
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,580
and that's also key because I took are

608
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,790
actually Jacque took Tim medine spot

609
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,889
today I'm actually Jeff and Tim switched

610
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,830
so Tim was supposed to help kick this

611
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:47,490
off so this one is called kerberos ting

612
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,990
speaking of Tim as well so occur

613
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,790
toasting you're basically taking

614
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,040
advantage of service principle names and

615
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:55,770
then basically pulling down the password

616
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,810
hashes for service accounts as well by

617
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:01,410
the way did you guys see the specter ops

618
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:03,870
post about like Kerberos ting I know

619
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,490
Jeff McJunkin will pull this out very

620
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,800
very quickly but they had a great blog

621
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,350
post that they just put up yesterday I

622
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,120
think it went up and so it's fantastic

623
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,280
if we get a link to not I think that

624
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,709
that's just absolutely great boy

625
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:21,450
somebody just popped an admin password

626
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:22,800
of a was the most easy exploit that

627
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,230
they've ever pulled off in their entire

628
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,860
environment I'll give you my easiest

629
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:30,570
hack ever for an organization okay

630
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,490
so I'll give that at the end of this

631
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,710
presentation don't let me forget I'll

632
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,600
give you the absolute easiest pack I

633
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:39,540
ever did for breaking into a company and

634
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,649
I did it with quasi permission here we

635
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,550
got a broadcast multicast protocol

636
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,610
attacked so that'd be like link-local

637
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:51,870
multicast name resolution a w pod

638
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:54,389
NetBIOS name service mdns pivoting and

639
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,750
then weaponizing active directory of

640
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:59,820
course bloodhound identifying into

641
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,530
exploiting trust relationships and we

642
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,080
consistent Active Directory and then

643
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,680
credential stuffing on the inside as

644
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,810
well

645
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,550
kind of like password spraying but we're

646
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,810
using Exploited credentials that was

647
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,350
actually what was used in the Sony

648
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,879
attack accessibility features this

649
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,830
actually got to get moved we

650
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,900
misappropriated this car so we won't

651
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,949
talk about that but you can use it new

652
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,110
service creation

653
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,600
it's basically adding new services in

654
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:26,639
the environment and then local privilege

655
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,969
escalation basically getting local

656
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,100
administrator on a environment as well

657
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,169
so let's see Jeremiah the easiest breach

658
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,000
that he ever did was he walked into the

659
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:37,770
wrong office that's next to my customer

660
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,270
they recently moved and I asked the

661
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,370
receptionist where the server room was

662
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,080
and they could give me the current

663
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,549
domain admin they could give me the

664
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,860
domain admin password and they did it

665
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:47,429
before they realized he was in the wrong

666
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,780
place

667
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:53,520
good god that is terrifying and that

668
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,080
should be that should be a whole segment

669
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,379
that we have at this conference like I

670
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,820
should be in prison because I think when

671
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,169
you've done pen testing long enough

672
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,080
there's a number of situations where

673
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:06,840
you've broken into the wrong place years

674
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,629
ago back when I was still doing pen

675
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,939
testing regularly my beards not quite as

676
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,100
gray as it should be but believe it or

677
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,960
not a long time ago I was actually a

678
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,178
pretty good pen tester in my own right

679
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,460
your whippersnappers I was hired by a

680
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:22,860
casino to break in and they gave me

681
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,419
their network range and I was able to

682
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,370
break into one of their Nazz servers

683
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,440
with the default user IDs ID and

684
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,760
password and once I got into the NASS

685
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,740
server and started looking at all the

686
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,179
files that were being stored I realized

687
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,860
that it had nothing to do with the

688
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:38,100
casino that hired me it was a completely

689
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,229
different casino so I called up my

690
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,668
customer and I'm like dude the range you

691
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,950
gave me is this it he's like yeah that's

692
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:45,900
our range and I'm like I just broke into

693
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,900
this IP address and it's totally not

694
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:51,390
your server it's this other casino

695
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,090
server just down the road and he's like

696
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:57,360
oh yeah dude we should have told you we

697
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,820
lease out some of our server space on to

698
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,620
other casinos within that IP range so

699
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,960
you might actually see some others

700
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,610
casinos in there as well just if you

701
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,039
break into something let us know who it

702
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,809
is it's like oh my god

703
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,570
so just very very cool there's the

704
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:14,519
specter ops talk by the way we're trying

705
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,229
to get Jo vest and Specter ops to bring

706
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,529
their trainings Walled was hacking fest

707
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:21,539
in Deadwood South Dakota so that is

708
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,909
going to be super cool for Deadwood

709
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,419
militia sir oh it done too far I've had

710
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,989
it myself

711
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:29,279
so that's pivot and escalate so now

712
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:31,080
let's talk about the next set of cards

713
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,559
these are persistence mechanisms how

714
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,149
would you stay on a network once you

715
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,580
have gained access right we pivoted

716
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:40,649
we've escalated our permissions on that

717
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,559
environment so now we're going to talk

718
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:46,168
about how we can persist so with

719
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,049
persistence it's just a service just

720
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,820
simple malware with the other one we

721
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:57,119
have is dll attack so you can basically

722
00:27:50,820 --> 00:28:01,739
use DLL injection malicious drivers on a

723
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:03,599
system not any users button stupid you

724
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:07,820
know just sticking with the basic stuff

725
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,840
right now we've got application siming

726
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,039
taking advantage of the application

727
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,418
compatibility toolkit on a system

728
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,820
malicious browser plugins which I don't

729
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:19,619
see nearly as much as I'd like to but I

730
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,139
really believe that the browser is going

731
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:23,549
to be the new end point here shortly and

732
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:25,258
we'll see people injecting malicious

733
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,940
browser plugins there's been a few

734
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:28,830
stories of those over the past couple of

735
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,029
months but I think really if you want to

736
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,918
persist you want to stay on the system

737
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:33,779
get access to sensitive data create a

738
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,759
plug-in load it up in the browser as

739
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:41,070
well log on scripts and then Evol

740
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:44,039
firmware this is actually one of my

741
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,499
favorites so with evil firmware the

742
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:48,090
attacker up the attackers update the

743
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:52,259
firmware of the network cards video

744
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:53,609
cards bios or UEFI with evil and all of

745
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:55,889
these are very difficult to detect and

746
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:57,928
very difficult to update detection is

747
00:28:55,889 --> 00:29:00,059
endpoint protection analysis and point

748
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:02,729
analysis and then I put prayers to an

749
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:03,928
engaged and merciful God so if they're

750
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:07,139
actually getting down into your firmware

751
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:10,470
that's a very very very bad day indeed

752
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:13,469
then the final set of cards would be c2

753
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:16,070
& exfil so how would an attacker run

754
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,200
command and control in your environment

755
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:21,029
get out of the environment Sarah we have

756
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,990
domain fronting as command and control

757
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:23,790
of course we mention

758
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,740
colbalt strike which is going to be

759
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:29,129
partner up with core security group it's

760
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,110
got purchased using Gmail tumblr

761
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,900
Salesforce and Twitter as command and

762
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,209
control

763
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,290
it's command and control over bits

764
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,350
transfer

765
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:41,360
it's pretty neat and then actually Derek

766
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:43,939
banks has a tool that he shared that

767
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:48,229
does that DNS as command and control as

768
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:51,800
well and then HTTP as data exfiltration

769
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:54,110
keeping some basic ones and then HTTP so

770
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,480
the point is you're gonna take one of

771
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:59,030
each of these color decks cards to

772
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,640
basically generate an incident on the

773
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,740
fly and then it's the goal of the

774
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,740
incident responders to utilize

775
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,480
procedures to be able to detect those

776
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,710
attacks now we have a large number of

777
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,850
procedure cards I'm not going to go

778
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,680
through every single one of them like

779
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,810
into the attack cards but there's a

780
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,540
large number of procedures that exist

781
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,879
now here's the deal the defenders can

782
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,879
run any one of the procedure cards that

783
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,580
they want to try to detect the attacker

784
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,950
but only the four procedure cards that

785
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,370
they pulled will they get a +3 modifier

786
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:34,010
now in the competitive game you can buy

787
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,959
additional procedure cards and increase

788
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,150
your ability to defend your network as

789
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,860
well as you earn money and by the way in

790
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:42,350
the competitive game this is one of the

791
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,570
things that I'm very happy with in the

792
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,899
competitive game the only way that you

793
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:51,470
get money is through failed rules so

794
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,820
let's say that you roll a 4 right so the

795
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:56,450
amount of money that you get is the

796
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:59,210
Delta between 4 and 11 so you got 4 or 5

797
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:02,960
6 7 8 9 10 11

798
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:06,320
all right so you get 7 incident bucks

799
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,030
because in security the only time we get

800
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,679
money is when we fail we call this

801
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:12,230
throwing money at the problem

802
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,820
so I like that quite a bit for this game

803
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,550
but you have things like crisis

804
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,980
management endpoint isolation endpoint

805
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,899
analysis Yui be a user nante behavioral

806
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,960
analytics endpoint protection analysis

807
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,660
is segmentation NetFlow bro Zeke Reeta

808
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,090
analysis firewall log review sim

809
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,860
analysis and server analysis so these

810
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:34,429
are the things that you do as a defender

811
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:36,229
to try to flip over those attacker cards

812
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:38,870
and basically illuminate the entire

813
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:41,600
incident now the other thing that's

814
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,850
really important about these cards is

815
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,860
the incidents not over unless you've

816
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,408
flipped over the

817
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,149
four of the phases of attack and that's

818
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:52,269
key because so many incident response

819
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:54,820
scenarios that we work with they the the

820
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:56,380
defenders will find them our remove the

821
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,539
malware and then they'll just call it a

822
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,950
day and walk away and that's not good

823
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:01,929
instant response right we've got to

824
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,549
figure out how did they get in did they

825
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:05,440
move laterally and were they doing

826
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:08,470
anything else to persist on the on the

827
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,860
network as well that brings us to the

828
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:16,269
inject cards now if the defenders roll a

829
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:18,580
zero or a one at any point then it's

830
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:20,100
going to invoke and inject it's going to

831
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:24,240
incorporate a little bit of randomness

832
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:26,830
into the game and this is more for

833
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,529
conversation right and it's also more

834
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,668
for trying to keep the game flow moving

835
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:32,740
and having it make sense

836
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:34,269
so here are some of the injects

837
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,130
management just approved a new procedure

838
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:39,010
that's awesome when that happens

839
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,690
now this card there's two cards that do

840
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,360
the same thing but they do in a

841
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:45,370
different way so this card says legal

842
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,709
takes your only skilled handler into a

843
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:49,658
meeting to explain the incident now why

844
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:52,029
are did I to create this card I have

845
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:55,870
this card and then your lede incident

846
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:57,370
handler goes out on paternity leave or

847
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,309
family medical leave is what we actually

848
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,620
did so I have two cards for removing the

849
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:07,960
skilled incident handler from the game

850
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:10,719
now I did this because I wanted to see

851
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,269
what happened to teams when the main

852
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,399
talking person goes away and the main

853
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:17,260
talking person is always a good person

854
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,229
they're always a nice person they just

855
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:23,049
don't shut up and whenever you have that

856
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:26,169
main talking person that refuses to be

857
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:28,450
quiet refuses to let anybody else answer

858
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:31,120
any questions in the room refuses to

859
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:34,840
pass the rock to anybody else I want

860
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,860
them out of the game and in here's why

861
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,360
usually those people are not the

862
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,979
smartest people in the room trust me I

863
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,090
talk more than just about anybody and

864
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,580
there's no way I'm the smartest person

865
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,139
in the room but do you want to see what

866
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,610
happens to the organization when that

867
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,380
person that takes up out of the Ox all

868
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,500
the oxygen of the room sets up

869
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:53,929
disappears what happens is the team then

870
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,950
starts facilitating better conversations

871
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:57,260
amongst each other

872
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,120
it's almost toxic for most security

873
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,679
teams if you find yourself the only

874
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,658
person that answers questions you're

875
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:04,730
like god the only person that ever knows

876
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:06,169
the answers to anything usually the

877
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,770
problem is in everybody else the problem

878
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:12,560
is you and you need to address that so

879
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:15,679
learn to shut up and listen to other

880
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,239
people and you will find and they know

881
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,668
this is hard to believe for some of you

882
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,949
but if you actually shut up and listen

883
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:23,888
you're gonna find out that things get

884
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:27,589
done better

885
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:29,030
and this was hard for me so you know in

886
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,230
the owner of a company right I'm the

887
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,990
owner of Black Hills information

888
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:35,179
security and I think I talked about Joff

889
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:36,918
kicking this thing off whenever I hired

890
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:38,270
jaar jaar was way smarter than I was

891
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,830
Jeff and I were working together on a

892
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,099
project with mutual friend of ours he

893
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:45,020
was 1099 and I think that hiring people

894
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:47,359
like Tim Tom's and hiring people like

895
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,730
Jeff and even Ethan whenever he was

896
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,409
coming out of college hiring people that

897
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,750
were smarter than I was out of the gate

898
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:56,720
got me to shut up and listen a little

899
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,700
bit better and I think it made me better

900
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,580
running a company because of it

901
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,848
so shut up ask questions of other people

902
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,140
and here's a little game I like to play

903
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:09,109
if you're in a conversation an IT

904
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:12,830
conversation if you have people that are

905
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:14,810
talking don't speak until everybody else

906
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,339
has taken a chance at speaking and if

907
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:18,920
you have two people that are co-opting

908
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:20,240
the entire conversation then pass it

909
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,290
over to somebody else so if you have two

910
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,720
people that are talking talking talking

911
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,670
you're like that's fantastic hey Bill

912
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,990
what do you think of that hey Jim what

913
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,369
do you think of what they said Susie

914
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,890
what do you think of that start

915
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:32,750
incorporating other people into the

916
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,270
conversation amazing wonderful things

917
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,940
will happen and I have the cards to pull

918
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,470
those people out of the game for the

919
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,330
rest of that game see how the company

920
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,950
respond sometimes they respond great

921
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,900
other times they don't know what they're

922
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,220
doing they just shut down not in itself

923
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,369
is telling there's some work that needs

924
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,270
to be done

925
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:51,850
with it as well

926
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,770
so give the defenders a random procedure

927
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:57,040
card is another inject take one

928
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:58,840
procedure card away sim analyst returns

929
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,910
from Splunk training any sim or log

930
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,800
related activities get a +2 modifier

931
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,440
this one's just evil this is a

932
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,660
conversational one the data is uploaded

933
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,640
to paste fit so how would your company

934
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,410
handle up and a lot of these are

935
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,000
designed to incorporate upper management

936
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,129
and what they would do with the incident

937
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,040
honey pots are deployed this will

938
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:20,440
actually force the attacker to flip over

939
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,840
their lateral movement card so they have

940
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,470
to turn that over right away another fun

941
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,640
one it was all just a pen test so the

942
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:33,009
whole incident was a pen test and

943
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,259
congratulations you kind of got him it

944
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,630
was not a real attack and then this one

945
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:40,000
is Bobby the intern kills the system

946
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,530
that's you're reviewing so those are all

947
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,150
the cards that are in this game kind of

948
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,100
an overview of how this game works and

949
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,500
honestly what I was planning on doing

950
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,720
tonight was going around on the boat

951
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,190
eating dinner going from table to table

952
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,399
the table and playing back doors and

953
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,320
breaches with everybody that was present

954
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,990
at dinner I'm just doing that but we

955
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,330
won't be doing that now this is the best

956
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:04,750
we got and I think it works out okay so

957
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:06,430
hey yeah go ahead Jason as just we had

958
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,170
someone playing one time and the inject

959
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,700
cards they got was data uploaded to

960
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,310
pastebin it was the first time Jack

961
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,080
where that's that's the second was legal

962
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,720
takes only school and learns you know to

963
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:22,900
discuss the incident and then the last

964
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:24,970
one they got was it was a pen test oh my

965
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,050
god well now we know what legal took

966
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:31,779
they're only skill dance and they

967
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:33,730
handler to a meeting the randomization

968
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,440
works out the way it does you know what

969
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,660
that's still a valid question right I

970
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,180
mean there are some firms out there that

971
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,930
are pretty unscrupulous and there are

972
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,540
times

973
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:45,129
okay so just using look we can actually

974
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:48,220
come with that I think it was mandiant I

975
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:50,410
might have this wrong but number of

976
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:53,080
years ago I think it was manning if it

977
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,319
wasn't I apologize please don't sue me

978
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,770
Kevin

979
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,720
but I think it was them and if somebody

980
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:01,130
can answer this just type it into

981
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,200
discord and I'll correct myself right

982
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:06,350
away but there was a security firm that

983
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,509
was handily ending out USB drives and on

984
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:10,970
the USB Drive they whenever they were

985
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,520
copying it they accidentally uploaded a

986
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:16,100
customer report on the USB Drive they

987
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,320
were handing out like Blackadder RSA so

988
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,020
that whole pentesting company posted up

989
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,390
on pastebin yeah that seems kind of

990
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:25,430
far-fetched but that craps happened or

991
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,440
we've actually seen a pen test report or

992
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,480
two from some companies that popped it

993
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,040
up there as well and also if you're

994
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,180
talking about paste bin there's actually

995
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,310
a there's actually a github repository

996
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,700
that has a bunch of redacted pen test

997
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,700
reports

998
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:48,040
um you know an actual pen test report I

999
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:51,669
missed and they had to remove it and get

1000
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:54,009
it scrubbed as well so that is the

1001
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,030
procedure cards so that is the what we

1002
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,140
were planning on doing and like I said

1003
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,400
most of what I was going to be doing

1004
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,560
tonight would be going to table to table

1005
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,210
telling people thank you and playing

1006
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,759
this game with people and then I think

1007
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:06,010
karaoke was going to be tonight and I

1008
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,660
was I had been practicing some karaoke

1009
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,700
songs that I thought would be really

1010
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,250
really really fun as well so there's the

1011
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:14,109
pen testing reports public pen testing

1012
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,300
reports that people share

1013
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:17,830
I don't think ours are up there yet but

1014
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,270
it's kind of funny there's a couple of

1015
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,970
those reports that they're actually old

1016
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,710
templates from old bhi us reports just

1017
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:27,009
fine and we share that with a lot of

1018
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:29,290
different people as well so all right so

1019
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:33,420
so what do you think so far is just cord

1020
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:33,420
gonna work folks I

1021
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,450
virtual con with with discord I think

1022
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,130
this is what it's going to take to pull

1023
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,390
the stuff together and by the way this

1024
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,090
is gonna become really important

1025
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:47,040
especially whenever we open up the voice

1026
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:49,500
discord karaoke I don't even know if

1027
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,140
that's possible and if somebody could

1028
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,240
research like a virtual karaoke and it

1029
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,549
was enough that without without legs and

1030
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,740
delay we know we need to make that

1031
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,750
happen so we need discord karaoke

1032
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,930
because we can do it here but how do we

1033
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:06,360
get somebody else to do discord karaoke

1034
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:08,970
remotely as well a week we can make that

1035
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:12,210
happen I will I'll research it dude

1036
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:15,200
you're practically dying I'm being sick

1037
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:20,070
it yes all right

1038
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,819
all right so that everybody let's call

1039
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,440
it a day

1040
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,450
tomorrow we will zoom at nine o'clock

1041
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,840
we've got the discord channel we've got

1042
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,629
the lobby con the track one talks I

1043
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:32,520
think it's going to be disconcerting

1044
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,840
disorienting for a lot of people that

1045
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,870
are presenting to have the discord

1046
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,230
flashing in their face live but I kind

1047
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,299
of like it

1048
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,440
feels a lot more engaged so I really it

1049
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,120
feels a little bit more engaging than

1050
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,510
presenting live because you can actually

1051
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:48,750
see what's going on in people's heads

1052
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:51,390
live just what it does just a reminder

1053
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:53,490
where we're using Mountain Time yep

1054
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,379
mountain times the amount of time

1055
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,790
because we're pissing off everybody and

1056
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,420
all the administrators that are running

1057
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:02,400
this are here for the network's side so

1058
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,570

1059
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,570
