1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,809
mr. Kevin Johnson oh man

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,400
it's funny Jonathan Kevin and myself we

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:10,769
all kind of started at SANS Institute as

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,200
instructors at the exact same time and

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,910
kind of came up together and really look

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,369
at these guys as kind of brothers in

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,670
arms' and that kind of weird cauldron of

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,980
strangeness because it is weird and talk

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,660
to and be like hey this really strange

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,800
thing happened to me with international

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,940
flights is that the way it works for you

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,650
guys yeah that's the way a word huh

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,330
Yemen is hands down one of the smartest

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,070
people I've ever met but that wouldn't

15
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,210
might be the reason why I bring him on

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,000
here one of the biggest reasons why I

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,070
have Kevin on while was hacking this

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,630
year is because there are very few

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,060
people in this industry that have a

20
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,829
firmer dedication to sharing knowledge

21
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,620
with as many people as possible

22
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,790
Kevin's sole existence you can tell from

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,589
the time he wakes up in the morning to

24
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,690
the time he goes to bed is how can he

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,910
share and get as many people up to speed

26
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,059
in computer security as possible he's a

27
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,129
he's an amazing presenter a brilliant

28
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,408
technical mind and if you've had the

29
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,539
opportunity to take a class from women

30
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,520
consider yourself very lucky and if you

31
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:11,009
haven't and watches classes whenever

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,439
they come up at secure ideas calm but

33
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:16,289
today's labors of Hercules

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,939
so Kevin please take it away I don't

35
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:20,819
know if I can live up to that that level

36
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,798
of expectation that you've you've thrown

37
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:24,869
out there and I'm very disappointed it

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,639
won't turn on my webcam I have my Sam

39
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,899
Cooper on a mannequin behind me it's

40
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:33,329
awesome but you all are missing it I'm

41
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:36,749
gonna try to live up to that I I will

42
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,369
say that I am honored to be part of the

43
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:40,289
speakers here at Weill was acting best

44
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,240
Joanna has put together an amazing thing

45
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:44,579
I'm just upset that we've stopped the

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,839
Old Home Week banter because this talk

47
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,689
isn't gonna be as much fun

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,090
so I gonna talk about the labors of

49
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,639
Hercules and John didn't mention this

50
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,669
but what I always try to do is come up

51
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:59,459
with a talk that makes me laugh and has

52
00:01:56,669 --> 00:02:02,490
a reason why I think it should be and I

53
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,560
picked the Disney Hercules movie because

54
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,408
it's my oldest daughters one of her

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,829
favorite movies and I love her she's

56
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,769
awesome

57
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,879
I love all my kids all three of them it

58
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:14,100
has been pointed out to me that I

59
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,530
misspelled Labor's I did not

60
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,299
that way on purpose because it's the

61
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,710
European spelling and since we're

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,870
talking about Hercules I felt like it

63
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,940
was important I have to say that all

64
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,100
graphics are copyright somebody other

65
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,600
than being I'm just using gives me

66
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,340
things which means we'll get a

67
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,579
cease-and-desist or something a little

68
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,490
bit about me before I get really started

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,490
I am the CEO of securities that's the

70
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,130
fancy way of saying head nerd I'm an

71
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,380
audience faculty member I am a course

72
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,510
author and instructor and John is right

73
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,140
about I don't know if I'm as dedicated

74
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:54,929
as he said I am but I do believe that

75
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:58,350
our purpose in life is to grow the next

76
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,690
group of people to do what we want to do

77
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,680
and if we're not sharing our knowledge

78
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:07,109
we're dying and I don't want to die you

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,100
can follow me on Twitter I do a bunch of

80
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,140
things I open-source fanatic I'm the

81
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,769
crew one of the creators of samurai WTF

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,600
Q apt 101 which is a six day WebP

83
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,150
investing course that's completely open

84
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,810
source and free it's out on github I am

85
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,210
also a dad I've got three kids two

86
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,520
daughters and a son that's me in the

87
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,370
Vader costume and the clone trooper I am

88
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,610
a member of the 501st that is actually

89
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,500
the thing outside of my family that I am

90
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,440
probably the proudest of for the people

91
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,240
who don't know the 501st is a costuming

92
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,650
group that raises money for charity

93
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,210
there's actually a number of security

94
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,370
people that are members of it which is

95
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,320
kind of fun we build screen accurate

96
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,020
Star Wars costumes and then go visit

97
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,530
kids and hospitals or raise money for

98
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,860
charity

99
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,600
I believe that figure for 2019 was like

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,420
seventeen million dollars worldwide

101
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,700
raised but I don't know so that's what

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,410
we do my wife says it's the nerdiest

103
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,019
thing ever I pointed out that she met me

104
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,850
when I was 26 she doesn't know what was

105
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,600
the nerdiest thing ever a couple other

106
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,220
things one I am full of tangents I'm

107
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
full of lots of things and my eyes are

108
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,390
brown and too

109
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,950
I have a sense of humor now many of you

110
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,200
you may have misunderstood that and

111
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,690
thought that I said that I had a good

112
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,510
sense of humor I did not I said I have a

113
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,130
sense of humor to give you an idea Mike

114
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,909
current favorite joke and it's been my

115
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,010
current favorite joke for a while now is

116
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:39,210
why was Walmart not hacked and the

117
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,010
reason is they're not a target so I

118
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,390
actually got the introduce like the CSO

119
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,620
of Walmart or something I don't remember

120
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,380
what their position was and I told that

121
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,240
joke and they wouldn't shake my hand so

122
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,760
let's talk about why we're doing this

123
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,180
one of the main reasons is there is a

124
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,440
gap in a cost for learning and I'm not I

125
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,910
want to be very clear we see all these

126
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,980
headlines right now cyber security

127
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,270
talent gap and all that kind of crud I

128
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:07,170
don't know how much I agree then there

129
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:09,120
is a gap in hiring I know it's hard to

130
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,710
find people to hire I know that it's

131
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,990
hard to find people that fill the

132
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,190
positions we have but but I think that

133
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,510
that's probably because we're looking in

134
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,670
the wrong place and we'll talk about

135
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,780
that in a second but the other problem

136
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:24,630
is and this is something that I have

137
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:29,700
really harped about quite a bit and that

138
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:31,409
is the cost to become trained and I'm

139
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,719
not picking on any particular company

140
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,190
here as a matter of fact the costs that

141
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,000
I have on the screen were pulled from

142
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,800
public websites and they've gone up in

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,360
all cases from the time that I show

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
these screenshots and they're all

145
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,130
different companies like this is not a I

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,620
can poke fun at that company whatever

147
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,150
that company happens to be this is

148
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,850
really a problem with our industry if

149
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,599
you're starting out that I can remember

150
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,960
when I decided to stop being just an IT

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,440
nerd and become a security nerd

152
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:08,430
um I started an IT in 1991 mainly by

153
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,430
accident I was a nerdy kid a guy I knew

154
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,160
was starting a company and he needed a

155
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,940
guy who knew how to develop and run a

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,700
network and was cheap well I fit all

157
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,350
those and so they hired me and I got my

158
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,090
first job right out of high school so I

159
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,710
always giggle when people say well when

160
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,510
I got out of college I don't know when

161
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,510
they were in college I got a job and

162
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,909
then I stuck with it so I kind of fell

163
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,760
into this position of being the 19 nerve

164
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,040
and I decided that security was

165
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,920
interesting to me and I wanted to get

166
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,560
into it and even then it was

167
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,740
expensive but we're talking 20 years ago

168
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,450
right I was I had to convince Denise to

169
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,160
let me spend money in training and the

170
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,849
let me go figure stuff out and we made

171
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,730
it work

172
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,190
luckily for us right but I look at it

173
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,590
now and now as a business owner you know

174
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,120
I've got 19 employees and they come to

175
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,380
me and say hey I want a class and I say

176
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,870
well how much is the class and they say

177
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,390
well how it's $6,000 or $7,000 and I'm

178
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,870
like what I can't afford that

179
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:12,780
III and they can't when we look at the

180
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,780
training costs and I'm not I want to be

181
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,179
very clear if people want to spend that

182
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,890
much great good for them if you want to

183
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,400
charge that much if they think it's

184
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,219
worth it

185
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,320
good for them I'm a greedy capitalist

186
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,690
I'm perfectly willing to let people

187
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,670
charge whatever they want to charge for

188
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,280
whatever they want to offer and if

189
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,980
people want to pay it good for them but

190
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,770
I think that we have a problem and I

191
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,760
think that the problem is that we aren't

192
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,289
teaching enough people we aren't

193
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,539
reaching out to enough people have these

194
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,730
skills and get them to understand what

195
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:51,870
they need to do and then we also have a

196
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:54,480
problem of what do we teach I think that

197
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:59,130
the biggest problem there is that people

198
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:03,060
don't know the path the end yes that is

199
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:06,030
an operating system pun but I like it so

200
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,180
we talked to people and and as somebody

201
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,619
you know John mentioned it earlier I

202
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,110
present all over the place I teach all

203
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,690
over the place I'm constantly going out

204
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,160
to customers locations and I'm I'm I'm

205
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,320
in the face of the company which is

206
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,220
really a bad choice because I'm funny

207
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,590
looking but we we go out and I am

208
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,870
constantly being asked by people I've

209
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,810
got schools that say to me how do we

210
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,090
teach our kids and and they're like well

211
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,880
I want to be you I want to do what you

212
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,140
do how do I get there and I think that a

213
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,330
lot of people think that there's just

214
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,770
this I can wake up in the morning I

215
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,200
finished high school or at finish

216
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,520
college and I'm now a penetration tester

217
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,960
but they don't really know what they're

218
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,449
doing and they don't know how to get

219
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,870
there and how to improve and where to

220
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:54,420
focus we see where it often like where

221
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,029
do I practice I want to learn this

222
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,740
but I don't know what to do or the

223
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:02,459
number of times I've seen people say

224
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,519
like on Twitter hey just go join a bug

225
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:08,729
bounty program and practice there I

226
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,649
cringe and that's not even a problem

227
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,779
with bug bounties like I we can talk

228
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,360
about bug bounties offline or somewhere

229
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:18,570
else if you want but that's not even up

230
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,750
I don't like bug bounties it's a if you

231
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,339
were a company offering a bug bounty did

232
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,300
you really want to get the people who

233
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,360
don't know what they're doing and are

234
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,790
practicing no that should not be our

235
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,100
advice we should be giving people who

236
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:35,719
are learning practice areas and in

237
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:39,600
places to go to learn more and end

238
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,970
whatever right on top of that if you're

239
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,040
the person learning or the person

240
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,670
teaching how do you know you're getting

241
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,939
the correct information one of my

242
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,349
favorite videos and and and I'm gonna be

243
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,620
really boring so you might as well gonna

244
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:58,920
watch it now but but go out to youtube

245
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,709
and do a search for next-gen hacker 101

246
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,810
this kid and I say kid I don't know who

247
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,399
this person is and I and I and I want to

248
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,560
be very clear I'm not making fun of them

249
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,279
but this video is where they walk you

250
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,589
through and show you how to see the IP

251
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,810
addresses of everybody else that's a

252
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:18,540
visiting a website right now

253
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,969
and you watch this video and the kid

254
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,980
goes through this explanation of how to

255
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,790
use and I'm gonna pronounce it the way

256
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,589
he pronounced it tracer T which many

257
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,760
people on this webcast probably caught

258
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:35,820
that it's traceroute and this kid is

259
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,689
doing a traceroute from from me it

260
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,819
sounds like a him his machine to

261
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:46,079
google.com and every single one of the

262
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:48,149
hops it takes he claims is an IP address

263
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,638
of somebody else is visiting google.com

264
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,529
right this second and he starts

265
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,449
describing and he goes into this detail

266
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:57,280
and let's be very clear it could be the

267
00:10:54,449 --> 00:11:00,339
ultimate troll I don't know

268
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:04,300
but this kid has put a lot of thought

269
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,200
and explanation into what he sees on the

270
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,140
screen

271
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,870
and he talks about how the timing right

272
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,060
the the 15 milliseconds whatever that

273
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,640
that is telling you how fast the

274
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,849
person's speed that they very internet

275
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,030
connection is and it he talks about how

276
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,500
you know that that's their user name and

277
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:28,420
that knows the coast like it's just

278
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,990
every bit of information in this video

279
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:34,420
is wrong right and I'm a Star Wars fan

280
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,910
so you know it's it's it's like Lucas

281
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:42,490
says right everything you just said is

282
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:45,430
wrong but he was so positive and so sure

283
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,820
of himself and and want to be clear I

284
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,930
admire that but I'm not I'm following

285
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,590
Tim's advice right

286
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:56,930
I'm not blasting this kid I'm just point

287
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,190
now that we failed him

288
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,729
because we didn't get them the correct

289
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,670
information

290
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:05,310
and he doesn't know that unless it's

291
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,170
just an elaborate role but I know people

292
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,930
who have watched his video and thought

293
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,099
it was real

294
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,349
thought that was the right information

295
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,279
how do we verify this and I'm not gonna

296
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,750
get into Facebook and Russian trolls and

297
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,540
fake news and all that kind of stuff

298
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,180
right but if we can't even get the right

299
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,380
information about politics how do we

300
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,569
expect to get the right information on

301
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:29,090
technology out to people

302
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,130
and are we teaching ethics and I know

303
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,930
that's a touchy subject subject for a

304
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,910
lot of people but are we teaching ethics

305
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,530
are we teaching the right ethics are we

306
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,500
teaching people when they should and

307
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:44,089
shouldn't do what we do because let's be

308
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:48,470
one what I do for a living day in and

309
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:51,050
day out is against the law except for

310
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,630
the fact that have contract except for

311
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,479
the fact that I have permission and what

312
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,760
does that mean right how do we how do we

313
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,380
know what we're allowed to do I just

314
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,850
have a conversation with a really really

315
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,370
good friend of mine one of my best

316
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,500
friends yesterday what a guy I think is

317
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,960
one of my best friends and he asked me

318
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,690
about a company that is just scanning

319
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,760
the internet and it talks about with

320
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:16,910
this problem in that and and Giovanni

321
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,370
was like hey well how does how did they

322
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,050
get permission for this and and he was

323
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,650
double-checking this in his opinion

324
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,670
correctly so they didn't have permission

325
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,970
so what they were doing was an ethical

326
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,290
and I happen to agree with that idea so

327
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,290
that's what I said no like yeah no

328
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:36,890
that's that's wrong but here's a company

329
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,719
who's offering a service of we scan

330
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,000
random other sites and tell you about

331
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,280
their vulnerabilities hey and I'm not

332
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,230
gonna throw them under the bus right you

333
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,610
know I'd like to so how do we teach all

334
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:50,720
this

335
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:52,940
so in my mind what we have to build what

336
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,620
we need to focus

337
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,950
we have to stop thinking about

338
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,720
information security as magic we have to

339
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:04,160
stop thinking about information security

340
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,900
as this really high education if you

341
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,990
don't understand you don't have a

342
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:12,829
doctorate in computer science reverse

343
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:15,260
encryption quantum flux capacitors

344
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,540
whatever what we really need to start

345
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,460
thinking about this is that we're really

346
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,860
just a trade and I'm not trying to

347
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,350
demean anything I'm proud of being a

348
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,370
tradesman I'm proud of being somebody

349
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,330
who is an internet plumber right and I

350
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,600
think that we need to start thinking

351
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:35,090
about things on a path just like a

352
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,690
trades person does and and you know the

353
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:40,820
the traditional historic apprentice

354
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,210
journeyman mentor and and please note

355
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:47,420
that mentor is the last class and

356
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,970
there's two reasons I know many of you

357
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,800
probably know the term master I don't

358
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,780
want to use that and then there's two

359
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,990
reasons I don't want to use it and one I

360
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:59,420
think it's pretty obvious there are

361
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,460
negative connotations whether you agree

362
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,800
with them or not or you understand why

363
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,710
people find them negative they are there

364
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,650
and we have to recognize that and in my

365
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:12,320
opinion just as importantly now maybe

366
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,670
not just as important but importantly we

367
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,750
also have to make sure that the person

368
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,400
who has made it to that level understand

369
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:22,550
that their job is to mentor everybody

370
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,220
else and honestly all three levels

371
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,479
should be mentor right if you started

372
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,600
out your entry level you're an

373
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,510
apprentice and there is a set of things

374
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,660
that you should learn and know how to do

375
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,130
and and so when I look at and as we'll

376
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,270
talk about in the next couple slides

377
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,550
we're going to talk about building

378
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,850
mentor programs and how to build this up

379
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:46,819
and create these programs but when I

380
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,020
want a mentor program I look at the

381
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,839
people who are just coming in as

382
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,360
apprentices they're their entry-level

383
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,339
they may know tons of stuff and we may

384
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,780
find out within a week of having them in

385
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:58,160
the mentor program or a day of hour a

386
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,520
minute of having them into the mentor

387
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,620
program

388
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,850
but really they should be a mentor

389
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,010
themselves or they should be a

390
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,410
journeyman or whatever right but but the

391
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,870
reality is when they start we think of

392
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,579
them as apprentice and the reason we

393
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:15,050
think of them as an apprentice is

394
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:19,280
because we want to hold them up to a set

395
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:22,219
of skills a knowledge base a knowledge

396
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,430
level that they should have the start

397
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,310
and and I really like pulling people

398
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,439
into these programs from a variety of

399
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,719
backgrounds I like pulling people from

400
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,240
help desks or pulling people from QA

401
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,000
teams or even project management teams

402
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,980
and non-technical teams to bring them in

403
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,220
to these mentor programs even if their

404
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,320
goal is not to become a super badass pen

405
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:48,920
tester but so that they can understand

406
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,089
and so that they can grasp because we

407
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,740
want everybody to understand security

408
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:56,690
because security is everybody's

409
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,940
responsibility right so we bring them in

410
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,820
as apprentice but we start showing them

411
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,950
stuff be sure working with them and this

412
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,959
is bi-directional we want to take stuff

413
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,780
from them too we want to learn from them

414
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,620
because let's be very clear being a

415
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:15,530
mentor is not the end it really is just

416
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:17,540
the beginning so we start to talk and we

417
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,800
start to discuss things we start to

418
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:24,050
teach them and show them and guide them

419
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,459
and that last part I believe is critical

420
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:30,580
to understand our job is to guide not

421
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:34,179
direct

422
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,899
we don't force them down of house we

423
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,610
guide them where their need to go

424
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,950
I'd them where they can get the best

425
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,559
knowledge and understand them and then

426
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,880
as they're doing this for a while as

427
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:50,430
they learn as they explore as we support

428
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,760
them they become a journeyman at this

429
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,500
point they're really confident maybe

430
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,140
they're excellent at some things but

431
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,410
they at least have a level of competency

432
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,930
and what I like to think of is using my

433
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,720
company as the example right what we do

434
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:09,630
is we consider somebody who's a

435
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,160
journeyman somebody who is ready to lead

436
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,630
a project they're not just a tester but

437
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,370
they actually are the ones that are

438
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,370
interacting with the customer and and

439
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,979
kicking the project off and scoping

440
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:26,939
projects and selling project right there

441
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,760
they're capable of we know that they are

442
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,070
good at what they do and they understand

443
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,660
more than just somebody who's like oh

444
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,280
yeah I know how to pin tests they know

445
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,990
how to be a consultant now that's a

446
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,700
secure ideas tournament

447
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,380
in your organization because you should

448
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,120
be building these programs in your own

449
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,190
organization in your own groups in your

450
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,678
own whatever that that level of

451
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,720
competency may mean a different

452
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,700
description and that's why I say it as

453
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,260
vaguely as I can on the slide but

454
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,929
there's somebody who's competent at the

455
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,840
job we're bringing them into and then as

456
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:02,200
they continue to grow because mentoring

457
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,779
doesn't stop I think that and you have

458
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,299
these random thoughts right I think back

459
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:08,890
to Richard Stallman's writer if you

460
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,110
bring him in to speak and let's be very

461
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,520
clear based on his rider I've never met

462
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,360
Richard Stallman but based on his rider

463
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,529
he is a nutjob

464
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,049
and I mean that as nicely as possible

465
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:19,210
but you know one of the things he wants

466
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:20,950
if you bring him in to speak is parrot

467
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,419
that he'd like to stay at somebody's

468
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,120
house and he hopes they have a parrot

469
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:27,340
what do you keep says to them don't go

470
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,219
out and get a parrot

471
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,199
because parrots can live like 70 years

472
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,270
or something right there they live very

473
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,000
long periods of time and like if I

474
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,649
bought a parrot at my age and the parrot

475
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,309
was young because while it's not my

476
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:41,620
birthday

477
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:45,399
today it was my birthday a few weeks ago

478
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:48,789
and I turned 47 if a parent can live 60

479
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:52,570
years it is unlikely that I am going to

480
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:55,090
outlive that parrot a parrot is a big

481
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,399
responsibility being a mentor is a big

482
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,809
responsibility you're constantly working

483
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,250
with them so as they get to a point

484
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,260
where they're a journeyman as they've

485
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,440
grown into a competent worker right

486
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:09,100
you're a job now is to continue to guide

487
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,799
them to continue to provide that support

488
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:15,520
and knowledge and understanding so that

489
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:19,299
they can grow into being a mentor of

490
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,340
their own because that is our goal as I

491
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:22,750
said the very beginning as John used to

492
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,279
describe me which I still don't

493
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,730
understand the accolades but okay I'll

494
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:30,549
accept them today but our job is is to

495
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:33,730
get to that mentor capability is to get

496
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:37,029
to the ability to pass on the skills we

497
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:40,090
have just recently okay a week before my

498
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:43,030
birthday I decided that I needed a hobby

499
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,639
that didn't involve computers

500
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:48,460
because I'm a nerd I've been a nerd for

501
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,270
so long that the guy who used to steal

502
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,600
my lunch money

503
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:55,820
still takes it on a regular basis and me

504
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,469
makes a good Subway sandwich

505
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,470
but I decided I needed a hobby that

506
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:03,530
didn't involve computers and I've been

507
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,540
fascinated by wood lathe you know where

508
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,960
they turn the wood and they use the

509
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:13,070
gouge to to carve it into a shape make

510
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,620
cups or bowls or pens or tops or random

511
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,530
shapes that fly all over the garage not

512
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,570
that I know speaking from experience and

513
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:23,399
I've on a lathe but before I bought the

514
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:25,049
lathe that was my birthday gift

515
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:27,399
I bought the lathe I started watching

516
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,929
YouTube videos

517
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:33,959
I started watching people who were

518
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:36,489
sharing a craft the art of wood turning

519
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,460
just like we should be sharing the art

520
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:42,099
of penetration testing or information

521
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,830
security or IP or project management or

522
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:48,009
whatever we do and I was just struck by

523
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,678
how much so many of these people in

524
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:51,940
these videos just wanted to share what

525
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:53,889
they're doing one comes to mind

526
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,679
immediately Steve Ramsey was his name

527
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:58,570
and he's the woodworker for mere mortal

528
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,339
woodworking for mere mortals is his

529
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,279
channel and I'm not pimping his channel

530
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:05,979
and I mean I am he's awesome and and he

531
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,719
just wants to show you how to do

532
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:09,219
woodwork and there's other people that

533
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:12,339
do the same thing right like here's how

534
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:15,940
you do this Turk wave and I was just so

535
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:20,320
impressed by their passion of sharing

536
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,879
and I hope that that people recognize my

537
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,580
passion for sharing and that you should

538
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:27,070
have the same passion so let's talk

539
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,439
about some of the rules you know Phil is

540
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,019
the trainer in Hercules see there is a

541
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,570
relevance to the Hercules reference when

542
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:36,279
Hercules needed to become Hercules at

543
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,349
least in the Disney movie in either the

544
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,700
trainer and he got Phil I'm not gonna

545
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:42,729
try to pronounce Phil's real name

546
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,289
Pullman and he has a set of rules and

547
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45,759
let's be clear in the movie he has like

548
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:49,379
a hundred rules or something

549
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:51,489
I've only pulled some of them as

550
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:53,799
relevant to what we're talking about

551
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:55,809
because most of the rules were jokes for

552
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,339
the movie and then I put some of these

553
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:59,499
relevance here right and then I

554
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:01,239
highlighted some of them and then I

555
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:02,979
think are important I think they're all

556
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:06,879
important we need to learn from our

557
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:09,039
mistakes but I think rule number one is

558
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:12,070
probably very critical for us to

559
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,090
understand and that is is that everybody

560
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:18,720
needs a hero

561
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:20,760
or a mentor is in my mind the hero is

562
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,020
the mentor that's what you become you

563
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,720
get to the point of you're a hero and

564
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,870
then you become the mentor everybody

565
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,070
needs one we all stand on the shoulders

566
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,550
of giants

567
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:35,370
I am only where I am today because of

568
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:39,600
the people who lifted me up and I hope

569
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:42,780
and pray and worry that I'm not lifting

570
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,780
up enough people that I want to be the

571
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,210
shoulders somebody else is standing but

572
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:51,450
we all need that hero every single one

573
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:54,000
of us we also need to remember that we

574
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:56,370
shouldn't get cocky and I think that

575
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,090
that number 13 on here is the same thing

576
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,929
right

577
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:04,980
don't stop for applause we don't do this

578
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:09,990
or we shouldn't do this a recognition of

579
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:13,410
being smart for being the best for being

580
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:16,530
number one III I worry so often when I

581
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,680
see people talk about things like oh man

582
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:22,020
I want to be an information security

583
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,840
rockstar you know what I don't want to

584
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,330
be an info SEC rockstar I remember when

585
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,379
I first started teaching her sans when I

586
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:32,610
first released

587
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:35,400
5:42 it was a four-day class and Mike

588
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,790
poor used to joke and tell me that I

589
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,060
wasn't a rock star I was a pop star

590
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:43,409
because I only had a four day class we

591
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,710
shouldn't be doing this for the applause

592
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:48,960
I've done some really really neat thing

593
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,640
and I don't mean that as in look at this

594
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,460
cool stuff I've done I've done things

595
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,190
that I look at no man that was fun that

596
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,200
was awesome that was impressive to be

597
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,970
but I didn't do them because they were

598
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,680
impressive I did them because I needed

599
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:06,420
to do them I did them because I wanted

600
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:10,050
to show somebody else I present on a

601
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:11,910
regular basis I I think I have five

602
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,899
different presentations I'm giving in

603
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,410
the next two weeks

604
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,800
I am absolutely petrified of public

605
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,250
speaking

606
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,260
I don't vomit anymore before I do it but

607
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,680
I am petrified of public speaking I hate

608
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,980
it I was nervous and upset all day with

609
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,780
the idea that at 4:30 Eastern today

610
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,580
I had to join a green room to check my

611
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,780
screen and my monitor and all that kind

612
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,250
of stuff to make sure it was working and

613
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,840
then a half an hour after that I was

614
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,490
gonna be presenting to all of you I've

615
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,500
been nauseous all day I didn't sleep

616
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:42,390
last night because it still scares me

617
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,130
and that's why I say I don't do it so

618
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,010
people can come up to me later today and

619
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,390
you did awesome or you socked it did it

620
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,580
because I think it's important for us to

621
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:53,700
share now a couple other things to point

622
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,770
out one play by the rules if we don't

623
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,940
follow the rules then when no better

624
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,740
than the people we're trying to stop

625
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,320
well no better than the people we're

626
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,150
trying to protect it gifts to play by

627
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,250
them one of the things I like here is

628
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:08,610
that greater your agility the greater

629
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:11,309
your ability and I like that because way

630
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:13,559
too often we get people who want to

631
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:16,980
focus on one thing I'm gonna learn this

632
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:19,168
one thing and I'm gonna be amazing at

633
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,540
but if you don't know all the things

634
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,940
that support it everything that is part

635
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,129
of it then you're not gonna be as good

636
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,080
as you need to be and as you're trying

637
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,280
to guide other people you're gonna have

638
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,949
problems and then finally we need to aim

639
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:37,590
this is a hard one I'm not a list person

640
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,059
I'm not a person who says this is what I

641
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,139
need to do and here's all the steps that

642
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:46,530
I'm gonna follow if you followed Tim's

643
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:49,500
Twitter thread yesterday threw in an

644
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,879
example of a story and I sadly didn't

645
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,980
make all of Tim's stalks I don't know if

646
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,850
he mentioned it of when Matt Carpenter

647
00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:01,770
and I were doing a pen test and Matt

648
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:03,629
follows a process Matt Eames amazingly

649
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:07,770
well Matt Carpenter is a person that I

650
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:10,470
am blessed to know privileged to call

651
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:13,900
friend and he follows a process and you

652
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:17,200
know what I don't I should

653
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,810
we did a pinch s together and I got root

654
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,890
access to the system ten minutes into

655
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:28,060
the test and it was funny because Matt

656
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:29,260
complained dead our boss that he didn't

657
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,970
think it was fair I didn't follow the

658
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,770
process he was following the methodology

659
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,960
and I got root and and I'm I'm

660
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,820
paraphrasing and making it sound way

661
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,000
more blah than it really was

662
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,960
the reality is that I got root in ten

663
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,120
minutes but Matt did a better job

664
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,539
Matt produced better results Matt

665
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,520
produced a better test than I did and

666
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:53,129
it's the same thing when we try to teach

667
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,639
other people if I just stand up and say

668
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm gonna teach you information security

669
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,789
you're gonna fail to learn it and I'm

670
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,200
gonna fail to teach it because we

671
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:06,730
haven't aimed correctly we haven't

672
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,860
realized what we need to get to

673
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,900
now having said that you have to be a

674
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,270
little careful because when I started

675
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,390
that journey to become a security person

676
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:18,850
I actually built a list i sat down and I

677
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,670
wrote ten I think it was ten thing that

678
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:24,280
I needed to learn and like I said in the

679
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,710
previous presentation when I hijacked it

680
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,110
I wanted to be Mike poor I wanted to be

681
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,510
like Mike that's probably trademarked or

682
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:34,030
something right and so I sat down I

683
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:38,080
wrote down ten things that I believed I

684
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:40,450
needed learned to be Mike and I focused

685
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,610
on the first one and I learned it and I

686
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,980
crossed it off the list and I realized

687
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,379
that I had a list of 23 things I needed

688
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,610
to learn

689
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,139
because when I was learning that one

690
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,668
thing

691
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:52,408
I learned a bunch of other things I

692
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:54,509
didn't know that I needed to know but I

693
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:57,299
still needed to know it so I learned the

694
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:59,639
next one and I had a list of 75 things I

695
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:02,129
needed more and then a hundred and then

696
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:06,090
the thousand and a million and now at

697
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:09,899
the point where I have a list of 473

698
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:12,689
Brillion items that I need to learn it's

699
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:15,299
actually why I believe that I will never

700
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:18,509
solve the imposter syndrome idea and

701
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:21,299
that's because I know how much I don't

702
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:23,489
know but I'm still aiming as we build

703
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:26,309
out mentorship programs we have to aim

704
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:30,749
so how do we build them because the

705
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:34,769
reality is we need to build them to help

706
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:37,650
everybody else and grow dreams of people

707
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:40,470
we need to secure us

708
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:42,450
and let's be very blunt I don't mean all

709
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:46,560
the people we need to hire to be

710
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:49,320
security people if we don't teach as

711
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,129
many people as possible what security

712
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,659
means and I don't mean user awareness I

713
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,310
mean actually understanding security

714
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,780
actually understanding why security is

715
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:01,020
important actually understanding what

716
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:03,740
security means if we don't teach every

717
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,900
single person we come into contact with

718
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:09,050
we're never gonna solve this problem and

719
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,580
I know we're probably not gonna solve

720
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,800
the problem it's just gonna keep

721
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,260
changing but we can make it better and

722
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,930
to make it better we have to mentor

723
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,270
other people now I'll be very clear I

724
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:22,460
don't like doing sales pitches okay the

725
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:25,100
only sales pitch I do in my talks and I

726
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,260
haven't done it yet is that if you're a

727
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:31,340
veteran or an active-duty military

728
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:34,610
person or a first responder much of my

729
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:36,260
training that I offer is free some of

730
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:38,090
its not if it's not it's hugely

731
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,890
discounted as much as possible

732
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,230
there's my sales pitch so if you are a

733
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,670
veteran or meet that qualification drop

734
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,220
us an email and we'll send you the

735
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:48,440
coupon code that's my sales pitch I have

736
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,540
two examples of mentoring programs that

737
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,790
secure ideas has built I want to be very

738
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:56,930
clear both of these programs are

739
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:59,450
services secure ideas cells I am NOT

740
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:01,310
pimping them I guess I am right I'm a

741
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,050
greedy capitalist here's to mentor

742
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:06,429
program you can sign up for and pay me

743
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:08,840
for but what I want to show you is the

744
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:11,420
implementation plan and we're gonna walk

745
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:16,189
through it right now of house here ideas

746
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:19,730
build these two programs so that you can

747
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:21,560
build the same programs yourself I want

748
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,110
to give you enough information that you

749
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:27,409
don't have to pay me cuz I've talked

750
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:30,199
about this many times I joke and say

751
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:33,140
that my goal is a business owner is to

752
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,530
be protested by the Occupy movement I'd

753
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:39,340
like to be so stinking rich but there

754
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:41,450
are pup tents in my cul-de-sac

755
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,909
complaining about my lack of paying

756
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,730
taxes or something like that right but

757
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:49,010
the reality is that my business goal is

758
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,950
to go out of business my business goal

759
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:54,830
is to show people how to do it

760
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:58,490
themselves so they don't have to hire me

761
00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:00,139
they don't have to pay me now the people

762
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,130
who hold my mortgage are happy to know

763
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,270
that that's probably not gonna happen

764
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,220
anytime soon

765
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:06,650
and I'm gonna continue to pay my

766
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,230
mortgage please hope so right but how do

767
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:10,460
you build a mentor program yourself okay

768
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,610
there's a couple things you need to

769
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,420
remember one you gotta follow a series

770
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:19,689
of guidelines

771
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:22,090
first one is make the program formal

772
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:25,870
now I don't mean that we all wear tuxes

773
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:28,540
what I mean is that we actually have to

774
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:32,260
formalize what the program means what

775
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:34,899
its goals are and what is part of the

776
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:38,170
program well what we plan on offering

777
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:41,500
how we plan on communicating it and we

778
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:43,000
need to communicate the plan right so it

779
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,400
has to be formal I've seen only too

780
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,310
often when I worked at Blue Cross of

781
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,410
Florida we've tried to do mentoring and

782
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:53,050
lunch and learns and stuff like that and

783
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,970
and I'm not bashing Blue Cross we either

784
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:57,159
people trying to do it or who've failed

785
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,200
and the reason we failed was it was kind

786
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,030
of this I will just do that when we can

787
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,920
right how about we meet during lunch

788
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,330
when I don't know when are you available

789
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,430
maybe that's week what do you think

790
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:08,860
about Tuesday ooh Tuesday is good

791
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:12,520
oh no Tuesday's not good formalize it

792
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:14,530
build out that process that plan that

793
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,990
communication and then let everybody

794
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:20,860
know what it is here's what we're gonna

795
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:23,200
do like for example with salsa what we

796
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:26,439
do is we tell people every two weeks

797
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,360
there is going to be a live webcast that

798
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,980
you can join there you go here's how you

799
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,199
join it here's how this works

800
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,270
this is the schedule and here are the

801
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,230
topics it's gonna cover you do the same

802
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:40,810
thing build out that entire process

803
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:42,520
before you start don't don't go into it

804
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,110
with the idea of well I'll see if people

805
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,810
want to do it and if they want to do it

806
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,060
we'll figure out what no don't do that

807
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:51,659
be flexible right if you come up with a

808
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,520
plan and you say okay every two weeks on

809
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,110
Tuesday we're gonna do this and then the

810
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,560
people you're mentoring come back and

811
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,929
say ah Oh Tuesday doesn't work and

812
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,740
here's why is there any way no no I

813
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:08,889
formalized this it's - no don't do that

814
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:11,860
be prepared to flex but have the plan D

815
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:13,810
flex fum okay because if you don't have

816
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,400
the plan you're gonna fit all fart

817
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,570
around for a while and that's what

818
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,150
happened with us when we're trying to do

819
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,429
the mentoring at Blue Cross is we fiddle

820
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:23,980
farted around and then we realized it

821
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:26,710
wasn't really working and because it

822
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,469
wasn't working nobody had the interest

823
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:32,830
to try to fix it

824
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:34,290
but that that was the issue it's a make

825
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,119
it formal

826
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:40,509
then

827
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:42,700
identify mentors now this I say

828
00:34:40,509 --> 00:34:44,889
aggressively I don't mean go beat people

829
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:46,658
up right pull a gun and run around

830
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:50,619
shooting at people until they become a

831
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:52,059
mentor what I mean is don't just put out

832
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:53,799
it let's say you're doing this inside

833
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:56,230
your company inside your organization

834
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:59,739
let's say you wanted to mentor people in

835
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,690
the sets right don't just write a people

836
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:03,460
and say hey anybody interested in

837
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:06,069
helping us teach other people how to

838
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,960
prepare for this program we actually see

839
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:10,390
this a lot with development teams but

840
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,099
security people realize that developers

841
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,569
need to know more about security and we

842
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:15,279
wanna build up security in our

843
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:17,170
development lifecycle and what have you

844
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,880
and so what what you'll see is a

845
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,009
security team will reach out to the

846
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,170
development managers or they'll send out

847
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:25,239
an email to all the developers or groups

848
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,950
developers and they'll say hey anybody

849
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,839
interested in becoming a security

850
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,299
champion I always love that term

851
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:35,650
security champions I got a shield and a

852
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:37,780
sword and a horse No

853
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:41,200
and it sends these emails out hey

854
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,440
everyone do this anybody anybody Bueller

855
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,439
Bueller

856
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:49,700
and they don't get anybody or they get a

857
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,410
couple people worse they get people who

858
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,029
there's no way that person is ready to

859
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,680
be a Venter notice I didn't say they

860
00:35:53,029 --> 00:35:58,210
couldn't be a mentor then they're not

861
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,210
ready to be a mentor

862
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:03,470
go out aggressively and identify the

863
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,230
people that you think and be mentors and

864
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:09,980
drag them into this program obviously

865
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:12,770
you can't kidnap them right you can it's

866
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,230
illegal in most states go out and

867
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,970
identify who you are gonna have be the

868
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:20,810
mentors to help out with this stuff

869
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:23,689
bring them in and work with them on the

870
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:26,600
plan work on them on the formalization

871
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:29,330
of the program now you should have the

872
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,830
plan started at least mostly done by the

873
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,420
time you bring the mentors into it

874
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,500
because if you bring them into it and

875
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,420
you say look I don't know what we're

876
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,700
gonna do but we're gonna do this they're

877
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:41,720
gone but bring them in and start working

878
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:43,759
with them on adjusting the planet for

879
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,819
the way the program works now the next

880
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,400
part is pretty complicated for a lot of

881
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:53,180
people but it's critical

882
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,550
have to provide multiple paths for

883
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,440
learning and there's a lot of reasons

884
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:00,400
for this Jason Gilliam one of the owners

885
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,580
here at security as hit dude is genius

886
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:08,060
he talks about as we were building our

887
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:10,850
mentorship programs how people learn

888
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:15,170
differently I don't know about you but I

889
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:18,200
like to read I read a lot I read every

890
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:21,010
single day I try to take in as much

891
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,319
information as possible

892
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,930
I don't learn well by watching a video I

893
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,400
just don't now having said that I just

894
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:31,000
released a whole bunch of videos this

895
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,380
morning but I don't learn that way

896
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,940
other people do I was just talking to

897
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,130
somebody I don't number who it was and

898
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,680
they were like oh man this is awesome

899
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:41,290
i watch these videos and it's so oval

900
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,509
one of my consults and he was watching

901
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,820
the professional evil fundamental videos

902
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,890
that we released today and he was like

903
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,380
man this is great this is a great way to

904
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,509
learn I I understand things so much

905
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,130
better when I watch it in a video and

906
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,780
now I'm happy to say he didn't learn

907
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,430
anything from the fundamental videos I

908
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,020
released today because he's above that

909
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,540
he's one of our senior consultants he's

910
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:04,720
one of our mentors but he's like I

911
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:07,200
learned from videos other people my

912
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,660
oldest daughter she likes to listen to

913
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,640
audio books and audio podcasts and

914
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,020
things like that listen because that's

915
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,400
how she can focus there's nothing

916
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,200
distracting she just sits there and

917
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,010
listens whereas my younger daughter

918
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,339
Sarah

919
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:24,180
she likes the videos she likes to see

920
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,920
things she also likes to do hands-on

921
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,529
doing the lathe we've also been pouring

922
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,780
resin to do these different our nerding

923
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,520
out at home with crafts right but we

924
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,280
have more glitter than anybody else

925
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,380
should have she watches a video on how

926
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,020
to pour resin but then she has to go to

927
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,660
it and until she does it until she

928
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:46,390
actually sits down with the total boat

929
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:50,319
and combines the hardener with the the

930
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:52,839
resin and stirs it up with the powdered

931
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,210
coloring and then pour it into the mold

932
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,620
and wait for its whole time and I'm

933
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,260
probably using terms that don't matter

934
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:02,410
in this context but you know the resin

935
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:05,770
that we're using has a pot time and then

936
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:08,020
a cure time and Dara read it in the

937
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,580
directions and she's 13 right so she's

938
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,150
read the directions then she watched a

939
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,759
video

940
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,960
Evon in Caitlyn it's the video series

941
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,030
that she and I like to watch together

942
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,380
and they were talking about it and

943
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:20,500
they're pouring it and Sarah kind of

944
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:23,260
understood it but it wasn't until we sat

945
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,050
down with the actual resin and poured it

946
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,330
and stirred it and watched it start to

947
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,550
harden as we were stirring it that she

948
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:33,160
started to understand pot time like how

949
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:36,040
long until you can't pour it into a mold

950
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,259
anymore and then the residue are using

951
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,960
as a slow hardening resin and so it

952
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:43,420
takes two days to completely cure and so

953
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,339
about three hours later it's

954
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,920
able to be removed from the mold if you

955
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:49,930
want to this particular resin don't

956
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,940
don't take this an advice on how to do

957
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,910
resin and we pulled it out of the mold

958
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,109
we were impatient right hahaha but you

959
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,970
could still tell that it wasn't

960
00:39:56,109 --> 00:40:00,730
completely cured and it wasn't until she

961
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:02,410
held in her hand and did it that she

962
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,569
really understood the difference between

963
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:08,799
pot time and cure time and what that

964
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:10,089
meant in doing this process and I find

965
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:11,920
that quite often with people learning

966
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:14,440
how to pen test until you dump a

967
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,970
database do you really understand sequel

968
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,040
injection so yeah

969
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,799
change the price on a website they

970
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,589
really understand logical art so there's

971
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:26,109
multiple paths that you have to take

972
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:27,640
into account in your mentoring and then

973
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:29,710
you also want to think about different

974
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,839
communication paths that's part of that

975
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,180
paths to learning right and what we like

976
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,308
to do is you know you've got some books

977
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,490
or written material slides

978
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:41,650
you've got recordings of audio and video

979
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,240
teaching you how to cut and do stuff and

980
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,460
then you have I say chat room that's

981
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,680
right but like we run slack workspaces

982
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,630
where you can sit in the slack workspace

983
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,490
and talk to other students and mentoring

984
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:54,849
and peas I guess is there I were and

985
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:58,328
like for us we actually have our

986
00:40:54,849 --> 00:41:01,210
consultants idling in those slack

987
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:03,579
workspaces so that they can be there at

988
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:06,190
any time to answer questions right and

989
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:08,680
when we actually have a an SLA that you

990
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,630
know within half an hour you'll get a

991
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,779
response during business hours to a

992
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,880
question in the sastra channel and and I

993
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,559
point that out that you should be doing

994
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,720
the same thing you should give people

995
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:22,450
this is part of making it formal jumping

996
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:25,899
back you give them an SLA an expectation

997
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:29,500
of how fast they'll get a response how

998
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,809
fast they will be able to talk to

999
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,750
somebody and and you also need to have

1000
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:37,750
them understand that the people being

1001
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,760
mentored have a level of expectation

1002
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,160
because there's nothing more frustrating

1003
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,630
than reaching out to somebody and asking

1004
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,629
a question because they're your mentor

1005
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:48,640
and and and let's be clear it's positive

1006
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,829
busy right they have jobs they have

1007
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,009
lives their families whatever their

1008
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:55,569
hobbies but you ask a question and it

1009
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,040
doesn't matter how unimportant that

1010
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:59,800
question may seem to somebody else

1011
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,390
to you it's critical to your mentee or

1012
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,730
whatever that word is right it's

1013
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:07,359
critical they have to have something so

1014
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,270
having an expectation of response is

1015
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,860
important in your program and

1016
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:14,050
communicating that expectation so that

1017
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,910
people know and I'll pick on sass the

1018
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:17,050
right I don't let you but I have no

1019
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:20,170
work-life balance

1020
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,610
it's a whole it is very often that it do

1021
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,290
in the morning I'm sitting on my

1022
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,270
computer working and it's the reason I

1023
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,440
need the wood lathe and somebody will

1024
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,720
throw a question into the sausage

1025
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,970
channels and I'll answer it because I'm

1026
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,060
sitting there but we try to make it very

1027
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:34,899
clear that if they get that answer at

1028
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,330
2:00 in the morning

1029
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,450
that's a one-off we're trying to help

1030
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:42,640
because we're there but but the

1031
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:44,230
expectation is that there will be there

1032
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,690
during business hours we'll be working

1033
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,880
with them at that time and then finally

1034
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:52,600
as you build out this program you have

1035
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,720
to ensure that people are engaged that's

1036
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,950
a typo it should say engage them reach

1037
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,140
out to the people that are in the

1038
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,910
program all of the people in the program

1039
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,859
the people attending the people

1040
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,899
mentoring the people and this should be

1041
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,730
a group thing but make sure that you

1042
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,290
reach out to people and are you

1043
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,750
understanding are you following are you

1044
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:12,910
doing this are you like we we give

1045
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:16,060
assignments like if you go through our

1046
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:19,210
sis mentorship program you get an

1047
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:21,400
assignment every single week of stuff

1048
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:23,050
you're supposed to read and quizzes

1049
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,670
you're supposed to take and practice

1050
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,340
exams that you should be following up on

1051
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:29,380
and we reach out to students and

1052
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,150
attendees and mentees whatever you want

1053
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,530
to call them hey are you reading it are

1054
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,080
you getting this are you following this

1055
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:37,510
is this making sense that we try to

1056
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:41,230
engage them and there's a number of

1057
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,680
reasons for that one it's important

1058
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:46,930
because people will feel like I don't

1059
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,839
want to bother them know it bother us

1060
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:52,270
let me manage my own time people also

1061
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,350
they get stuck and a lot of times I

1062
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:56,350
don't know about you but I've done it

1063
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:58,210
right where I've gotten stuck on

1064
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:01,779
something and the next thing I realize

1065
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:03,970
is it's been three days and I haven't

1066
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:07,270
solved my problem and it's because I was

1067
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:09,129
stuck but if my mentor had reached out

1068
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,690
in that three day periods of Kevin how

1069
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:13,000
you do I would have immediately said

1070
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,380
having problem with this the other thing

1071
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,480
that you need to make sure that when you

1072
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,270
reach out to them is that you are

1073
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,170
accepting feedback and paying attention

1074
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:26,180
to the subtle unspoken feedback of how

1075
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:27,950
well you are meant to ring

1076
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,240
because if you reach out to one of your

1077
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,029
mentors one of the people you're

1078
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,899
mentoring to me and they comment that

1079
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,060
they haven't heard from you in a couple

1080
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,800
weeks they're not trying to be mean it's

1081
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,299
just that great here for me I

1082
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,910
interviewed a couple weeks you're

1083
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,710
failing you've messed up in your program

1084
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,990
you need to make sure that you're paying

1085
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:46,070
attention and if they ask you a question

1086
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:48,890
one of the things I hear

1087
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:52,220
I'll explain something and mentoring

1088
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:54,440
students whatever you hear this you'll

1089
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,730
say hey okay this ask you a question

1090
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,100
you'll explain the question and how

1091
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,460
often do you hear an instructor say make

1092
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,980
sense

1093
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:03,170
you got it does that work yeah yeah you

1094
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,900
you with me and the only right answer

1095
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,220
there's yes of course I got it now

1096
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,040
that's not true that's not the only

1097
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,779
right answer but as the person mentoring

1098
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,240
that's the instructor what you need to

1099
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,350
listen for is first and going yeah yeah

1100
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,439
it's okay I got it

1101
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:19,520
no you probably don't let's talk a

1102
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,280
little bit more you don't want to bother

1103
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,630
in it you feel dumb we all feel dumb

1104
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,640
I can tell them to tell you the number

1105
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:27,560
of times I've had somebody teaching me

1106
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,220
something and I've just not gotten it

1107
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:36,160
and I felt stupid asking them to repeat

1108
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:38,529
it again and again and again

1109
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,328
the mentor if you engage people if you

1110
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,579
reach out to them you'll know they're

1111
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:44,619
having that problem that's our goal and

1112
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:46,480
like I said security is we've

1113
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:49,089
implemented two programs of mentorship

1114
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,380
that we believe are very successful the

1115
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:52,808
feedback we've gotten from people are

1116
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,730
very successful we're building more and

1117
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:55,930
I'm not saying that like oh hey look at

1118
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,760
these great programs by them

1119
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:00,240
please look at these great programs by

1120
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,260
them that's the way I make payroll but

1121
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,740
you can build them yourself

1122
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:08,140
our entire responsibility is to be like

1123
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:12,009
Phil now I mean the rough-in a drunk

1124
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:16,089
I mean mentoring the next series of

1125
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:18,940
Heroes being the shoulders people can

1126
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:21,609
stand on thank you and now I'll open it

1127
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,470
up to questions I am NOT in I just

1128
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:25,480
realized I'm not in the discord Channel

1129
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,919
so I'm going to let whoever is the

1130
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,349
person in the discord channel repeat

1131
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,030
questions to me oh that would be not

1132
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:33,309
problem is we get all of these different

1133
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,890
things that pop up got a question for

1134
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:37,839
you this is from I'm gonna just call

1135
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:40,000
them swag nur cuz that sounds cooler

1136
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,470
spent the better part that's two years

1137
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,700
establishing Club my college that

1138
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,098
provides a live environment to learn

1139
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,230
blue and red team options any tips or

1140
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:49,630
resources for building an introductory

1141
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,609
mentorship program most of the time we

1142
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,109
have new members come in and tend to get

1143
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:54,549
overwhelmed the concepts are more

1144
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:56,380
seasoned members are engaging so I think

1145
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:58,029
it's like that wave thing where the

1146
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,470
people that are at the earlier part they

1147
00:46:58,029 --> 00:47:01,029
get in and they start doing amazing

1148
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:03,459
stuff and then people that come in get a

1149
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:05,289
little bit intimidated yeah so there's

1150
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,500
two things I'd recommend doing it one

1151
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:10,119
and we just started it this morning

1152
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,700
we've released our professional evil

1153
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:15,460
fundamentals and it's a YouTube playlist

1154
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,549
as dumb as that is and they are two to

1155
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,410
four minute videos that are just

1156
00:47:17,549 --> 00:47:22,359
definition and we're we're we've got

1157
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:24,819
like 21 of them recorded now and they're

1158
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:27,578
being published two at a time three at a

1159
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:29,558
time over the next few weeks but but the

1160
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:32,559
goal there is and you can do the same

1161
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,839
thing is start documenting and recording

1162
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,630
whether it's a video or just writing it

1163
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:39,430
down that introductory stuff so that as

1164
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:42,130
somebody comes in they've got a place

1165
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:44,200
they can go to get it that's that's the

1166
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,430
first recommendation the way John

1167
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,558
described that's right yeah you have

1168
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:49,390
these waves of people come in and and

1169
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:49,700
they come in and then two weeks later

1170
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,379
there's

1171
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,480
new group but the old group is still

1172
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,610
pushing forward the second

1173
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,010
recommendation and I'm gonna pick on my

1174
00:47:55,610 --> 00:48:00,170
sis mentorship program because it's how

1175
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:02,270
we do that if you were to sign up and

1176
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:03,920
and check on sales pitching and I'm not

1177
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,820
if you were to sign up for the

1178
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,890
assessment for program

1179
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,830
it's a nine-week program it has a

1180
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:13,160
definite calendar it has a start and a

1181
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:16,009
stop and you pay for it came for it that

1182
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,740
one time you then get to take the

1183
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:21,230
mentorship program as many times as you

1184
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:23,419
want because our goal with all mentoring

1185
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:25,250
is not just to prep somebody for that

1186
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,140
test but to prep people for

1187
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,810
understanding of the knowledge right and

1188
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:32,060
in learning and so what we do and we've

1189
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:34,310
actually seen it it's been beautiful in

1190
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:36,110
the Syst program is that what you have

1191
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:39,860
is we have a nine week program people

1192
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:43,400
take it they learn they engage they talk

1193
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:45,050
they build relationships and they finish

1194
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,360
the mentor program and then we take

1195
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:49,640
about a month we do it a month because

1196
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,220
we're billable consultants and then we

1197
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,150
launch another mentor program and

1198
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,919
everybody who is in the other one can

1199
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:57,200
sign up for the new one and then we have

1200
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:02,990
new students come in and what we find is

1201
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:04,730
that one the experienced mentees I don't

1202
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:07,729
know if that's really the word but they

1203
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:10,400
start exploring more we start getting

1204
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:13,610
more complicated discussions going and

1205
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,590
deeper dives into the theoretical and

1206
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:18,230
this and that which is awesome right and

1207
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:20,420
fun and also probably overwhelming to

1208
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:23,300
the new people but the new people are

1209
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:25,610
being presented the stuff in that same

1210
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,310
calendar moving forward that is that

1211
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:29,690
program that everything else and but

1212
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:32,150
they're also getting exposed to the the

1213
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:33,560
more advanced stuff but what I'm seeing

1214
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,900
and this is the beautiful part in my

1215
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,980
mind we're seeing the people who have

1216
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:42,680
taken the mentor program before becoming

1217
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:44,150
mentors themselves they're helping

1218
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,740
people they're answering the questions

1219
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,360
they're guiding people through things

1220
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:50,540
it's gorgeous

1221
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:55,280
and and so that to me is the way to do

1222
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:58,310
it is to have a time frame per program

1223
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,250
but too often I see these these hey

1224
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:02,779
here's a lab environment you can play in

1225
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:05,719
and everybody gets

1226
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:08,959
it's freeform and there is no this is

1227
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:11,989
the star here's the end and that's leads

1228
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:14,509
to that oh man people are so far ahead

1229
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:16,609
of me that I'll never catch up I might

1230
00:50:14,509 --> 00:50:19,069
as well stop is that I hope that makes

1231
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:21,049
sense yeah I think that answered it also

1232
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:22,669
another question I came in I thought was

1233
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:24,019
interesting was I'm a college student a

1234
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:25,848
cyber security program in school do I

1235
00:50:24,019 --> 00:50:27,769
need a mentor I don't have a clue about

1236
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:29,209
cyber security I'm accomplished student

1237
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:32,178
and I have worked with computers all my

1238
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:33,828
life I'll take a crack yes but you don't

1239
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:35,659
necessarily have to go and find someone

1240
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:38,569
and say will you be my mentor because

1241
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:40,579
there's lots of people like Kevin ibh is

1242
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,929
we do webcasts all the time there's a

1243
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,640
tremendous number of people that are

1244
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:45,349
constantly giving back to the community

1245
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,390
that you can basically be hooked into

1246
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:48,919
their program and start seeing the

1247
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:51,259
webcasts going through their training

1248
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:52,969
packet Vox all of these different things

1249
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:55,279
that that would be my recommendation

1250
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:57,979
Kevin I agree with your recommendation

1251
00:50:55,279 --> 00:51:01,279
the only addition I would do is I do

1252
00:50:57,979 --> 00:51:05,178
actually recommend getting a local

1253
00:51:01,279 --> 00:51:06,979
mentor as well and the reason is and in

1254
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:09,140
my opinion it shouldn't be one person

1255
00:51:06,979 --> 00:51:10,368
what you should do is try to engage in

1256
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,379
local groups

1257
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:14,659
everybody needs Mentors you're gonna

1258
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,189
need mentors your entire life no matter

1259
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:18,140
what you do there's gonna be something

1260
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:19,669
else you need to learn and there's gonna

1261
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,788
be somebody who knows it better than you

1262
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:25,908
I will tell you that Black Hills is an

1263
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:27,679
organization I I am in Slee admire the

1264
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:29,989
John said at the beginning of how my

1265
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:33,319
passion is to share so this is John

1266
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:35,839
Wright and they are constantly putting

1267
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:38,509
stuff out there get engaged follow

1268
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:41,119
people on Twitter join the conversations

1269
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:43,789
getting slack channels and ignore the

1270
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,009
noise uh I've seen way too many people

1271
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:47,900
who jump into these things and they'll

1272
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:50,929
they'll still out a question as somebody

1273
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,380
who is quote-unquote awesome at this

1274
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:53,630
stuff

1275
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,849
and they'll get a rude answer back what

1276
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,519
I have found is everybody who gives an

1277
00:51:55,849 --> 00:52:00,529
asshole answer to something is probably

1278
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:02,808
not that good at what they say they can

1279
00:52:00,529 --> 00:52:05,749
do people I know there's actually good

1280
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:08,569
at stuff want to share it well and I

1281
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:10,669
also think the the noise there's there's

1282
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:12,558
places like that are fine Prannoy it's

1283
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:16,700
like Twitter is there for politics noise

1284
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,780
and social just Argyle argue out things

1285
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,700
but don't for a second think that

1286
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,320
Twitter is what the information secure

1287
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,029
security community is and that's all

1288
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,589
that it is you can go to LinkedIn where

1289
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:27,589
it's professional it's a little bit

1290
00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:28,790
almost a little bit stifling from time

1291
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:31,099
to time but don't think that that's what

1292
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:33,500
it is you almost got a hit in multiple

1293
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:35,570
places and spread out and take the good

1294
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,880
and ignore the death unless I will

1295
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:39,050
actually say find those live somebody I

1296
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,700
was gonna say if somebody on Twitter

1297
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:42,349
basically says you shouldn't wash your

1298
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,750
hands for whatever reason you're still

1299
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:47,630
safe to ignore those people oh and Nazis

1300
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:49,250
and more Nazis I did agree I don't think

1301
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:51,650
we should ignore Nazis I think we should

1302
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,180
punch them in the throat oh crap that's

1303
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:55,190
right remember our parents always said

1304
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,569
violence is never okay unless Nazis I

1305
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:59,150
mean even my mom I would play

1306
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:02,619
Wolfenstein and she's like I'm like mom

1307
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:05,240
it's not just like okay it's go kill him

1308
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:07,070
one final question before you go I'm not

1309
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:11,049
gonna say who this is from but who's

1310
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:13,579

1311
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:15,349

1312
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:18,010
employee of the company that is the only

1313
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:18,010
right answer
