00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,150
hello everyone cheers from Philly with

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,100
apologies to Samantha bee who called her

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,500
election game this is not a game the

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,410
game we're going to roll through this

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,860
I am a system administrator at and

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:25,310
medicine I don't have a security gig per

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:28,020
se but I love playing security games and

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,909
running with run running with scissors

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:36,809
in the in the metaphorical sense so

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:40,229
games and InfoSec have had a history

11
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,709
together since the 70s but everything

12
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:47,010
has really just been abstract nobody has

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,949
or at least few games themselves got

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,218
into the nitty-gritty of what it is to

15
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:55,170
do a penetration test or any kind of

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,139
coding usually you just got a little

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,679
menu option about how to probe the

18
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:05,159
system attack a system and you know you

19
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:08,340
just get a little ping when it finishes

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,960
more recently in the last 10 years or so

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,180
a lot of games have been on PC involved

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,689
in actually getting people to code it's

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,939
not just for programming these are

24
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,939
actual video games that you can have fun

25
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,158
with pack and slash is a fun one where

26
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,070
you can change the behavior of the

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,310
objects you run into in the world you

28
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,529
can tell the birds that attack you to

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,380
restore your health instead of taking

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,409
hit points away you can change the hit

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,589
points of a wall you can make preachers

32
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,200
friendly instead of aggressive or make

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,920
them aggressive toward your enemies and

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,759
it's all about getting through this

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,579
little Zelda like world in a clever

36
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,329
little way by changing behavior through

37
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,960
social engineering hack net is more of a

38
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,729
classic 90s packing game but with more

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,399
pretty you can run it through

40
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,360
point-and-click or through typing

41
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,190
commands but it's really just for the

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,630
story you're not going to learn anything

43
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,140
fun

44
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,650
out of it except for where they pull in

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,010
people's email files and you get to read

46
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,190
through those logs on the other hand

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,480
else heartbreak is very complex the

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,609
story is very minimal but you get to run

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,209
all over the world and change the

50
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:43,140
behavior of the items that are in the

51
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:46,290
game you can move your hotel room around

52
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,500
the city there is some sort of secret

53
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,440
police agency in here but since this is

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,050
a swedish game and sweden loves hackers

55
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,530
they don't actually do anything scary

56
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:01,200
they just exist what I have been into

57
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,710
lately is the last game called exit

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,950
Punk's which comes from the Zac Tronics

59
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,950
studio they make three different games

60
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,369
that are based on assembly programming

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,640
on your left-hand side here is the code

62
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,060
for the bots that you run around either

63
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,760
breaking into systems or even rewriting

64
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,360
your own neurons and it's a fun little

65
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,700
game

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,970
that's the end of the video games now we

67
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,820
get into the stuff where for the folks

68
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,440
here I pack and fest it's kind of like

69
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,239
now I'm going to show you how to lock

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,340
the barn door and when the horses are

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,990
already out because we've been playing a

72
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,750
captured flight game for the last two

73
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,650
days that should be used I cannot see

74
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,580
that anymore

75
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,670
I am a system administrator as I've said

76
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,150
so my life is spent in the blue team my

77
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:57,850
red team skills are fairly weak my worst

78
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,090
skills are in penetration testing for

79
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:04,660
wireless networks and for some reason I

80
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:08,880
can't quite get the hang of sequel

81
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:12,340
injection if they have any sort of

82
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,760
defense period but every time I play a

83
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,950
CTF my goal is to learn two or three

84
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,099
things that I have not done before or

85
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:26,190
haven't done well before and keep

86
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,720
improving the best CTFs have many

87
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:33,790
command skills that you need to get used

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:37,900
to and the more extensive and varied the

89
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,910
puzzle is I think it makes it more open

90
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,810
to people with different skills and it's

91
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,000
great for team building I can do a lot

92
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,060
of things in Linux I can do almost

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,430
nothing in Windows and so the game that

94
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,180
we've been playing with meta CTF has

95
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:59,310
been awesome because I've got a teammate

96
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:02,950
Jason who has been really great in the

97
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,720
and I also have dis no Meah I'm sorry

98
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,090
I'm looking at Jason's name but my

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,490
teammate is Lucas look at San Diego it

100
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,650
has been awesome in particular with the

101
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,169
windows challenges but when you have

102
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,200
people with different skills that's how

103
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,840
you put together a great team either for

104
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,450
a CTF or for an actual threat hunting

105
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,719
team you get to teach one another and

106
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:30,099
cross pollinate and pick up new skills

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,350
that way so many folks that are here at

108
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,870
Wild West hack and fast the virtual con

109
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,700
already know how to solve a CTF

110
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,920
hopefully this will be great in the

111
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,860
youtube you know the puzzles you

112
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,050
usually start simple if you have to find

113
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,570
it just complete a bunch of puzzles to

114
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,280
unlock others then they should start

115
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,130
simply you know just like in any other

116
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,080
video game but you can you know flags

117
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,500
are easy to find sometimes you can just

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,530
prep for them if you're looking for

119
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,350
underscores or the phrase CTF and in

120
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,809
others you get to do a little more work

121
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:08,470
they really do have practical uses

122
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:12,820
sometimes you know penetration testing

123
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:14,590
games and CTF give you all sorts of you

124
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,150
know titles and clever clues that you

125
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,500
don't get in the real world on

126
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,500
engagement but

127
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:27,200
when you are in a an actual sticky

128
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:31,080
situation

129
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,830
you know you just use those same skills

130
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,190
that you earned in a CTF to solve your

131
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:41,669
problem when you're working on a CTF

132
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:45,750
you'll run into a lot of common puzzle

133
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:49,110
types that involve web casting picking

134
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,720
out improper permissions escalating

135
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:55,440
privileges and finding default

136
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,830
configurations that are insecure and

137
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,010
these aren't all contrived because

138
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:05,729
everything that has gotten into a CTF

139
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:08,099
isn't just because problem that's been

140
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,350
well known it's a problem it's usually a

141
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,510
problem that's persistent across

142
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:16,230
multiple operating systems multiple

143
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:19,650
devices multiple pieces of software I

144
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:24,570
have the unfortunate pleasure of working

145
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:28,560
a lot with WordPress in my job and the

146
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:32,550
number of sequel injection flaws that

147
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,889
come up in a plug-in or even in base

148
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:40,120
code is unending

149
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:42,280
unending when you were getting to a

150
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,310
Husker Minh perfect if you use you word

151
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,849
for us you don't host it yourself I wish

152
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:53,020
I could do that it's my job to be to

153
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:56,229
suffer but you can play CTFs online

154
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,409
anytime you want just like they were any

155
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:03,128
other game on your computer or your

156
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:05,319
tablet because they are up on servers

157
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:08,169
like micro corruption I told you how

158
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,509
much I loved the electronics games that

159
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:13,990
you code and assembly here you actually

160
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:17,169
get to do disassembly in a very pretty

161
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:20,020
interface over gdb you pop around the

162
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:22,960
world opening supposedly intelligent

163
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,240
locks each one that you do unlocks

164
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,060
another city and another piece of your

165
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,909
travel budget that you get to perform a

166
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:34,029
trial a challenge in other things that

167
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:37,510
you can do for web attack and practice

168
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:39,909
is open up the OWASP juice shop they

169
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,000
actually host it on Heroku or you can

170
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:46,810
download it yourself from github and put

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,040
it on a server in a VM or on your home

172
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:57,459
network and just attack a very poorly

173
00:08:51,040 --> 00:09:00,670
configured website Piko CTF is not a its

174
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:02,529
time limited competition for any kids

175
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,740
that you have in your life that are

176
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:08,709
interested in security once the

177
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,130
competition is over it stays up online

178
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:14,439
for anyone to practice with and every

179
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,350
year the gans Institute runs the holiday

180
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,230
hat challenge which for the past two

181
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:23,380
years has actually included a virtual

182
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,800
conference called Kringle con with talk

183
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:30,040
videos that have been pre-recorded

184
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:33,370
without all these pens and O's they tend

185
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,730
to go through very ripped from the

186
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:41,010
headlines format in terms of the exploit

187
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:44,110
able conditions that are presented

188
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,779
what's really important for them is that

189
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,120
you write an after-action report when

190
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,670
the conference is wrapping up and

191
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,920
they choose the winners based on those

192
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,639
reports and even if you didn't finish

193
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,259
all the problems you can still win

194
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:03,279
t-shirt surprises based on your

195
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:05,920
reporting as opposed to just the puzzles

196
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,029
themselves so here's a quick list of

197
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,819
other sites where you can find

198
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:15,579
challenges all the time the other next

199
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:20,290
step is to actually create a home lap

200
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:23,649
you can have and not just the OWASP

201
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:27,670
juice shop on a Raspberry Pi but have an

202
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:30,160
entire network of insecure whether

203
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,810
accidental or deliberate systems that

204
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,259
you can attack

205
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:40,008
the first of these that I found was

206
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:43,430
called damn vulnerable Linux it was a an

207
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:46,670
early penetration testing distro to be

208
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,370
you know tested against it was a good

209
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,439
practice I don't know about Windows ones

210
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm sorry that I did not research that

211
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:58,389
for you but dbl is a lot of fun if you

212
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,870
have actually lived through the 90s

213
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:07,189
Metasploit able is a great resource for

214
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:10,519
more practice and a testbed for the

215
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:14,029
actual Metasploit framework State

216
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:17,029
Security Labs is an academic program

217
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:22,129
that lets you practice against specific

218
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:25,279
flaws and exploits and is particularly

219
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:29,540
good for if you want to do testing

220
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:33,009
against Android or iOS because they have

221
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:39,050
mobile vulnerabilities as well as

222
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:42,339
regular Windows or Linux servers if you

223
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:45,889
want to get the entire site full of

224
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:49,160
vulnerable machines - clay envelope up

225
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:52,160
is a great resource for that so like I

226
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,439
said you can set up a home lab not just

227
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,209
with VMs but with cheap hardware

228
00:11:54,439 --> 00:12:03,800
sometimes if you have a weird waste day

229
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:07,040
or electronics recycling day in your

230
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,250
neighborhood you can go and pick up

231
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,219
machines from people that are just

232
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,490
giving them away because it's old or

233
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,920
it's not safe but it's just old and

234
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,050
unsafe enough for you to learn how to

235
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,490
penetrate all you have to do is hope

236
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,740
that the people didn't include their

237
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,660
hard drives and the machines

238
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,340
do not test against your neighbors

239
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,390
routers unless they've already given

240
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,510
them to you

241
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,960
Raz poon for the Raspberry Pi actually

242
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:40,400
puts an entire virtual network on a

243
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,980
single PI that you can attack from the

244
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,829
command line on the machine

245
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:49,400
sticky-fingers has not just a Kali build

246
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,920
but also a vulnerable server that you

247
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,290
can put onto your home network I would

248
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,360
recommend putting this on a segregated

249
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,939
router from your actual home network

250
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,810
take something that is less than

251
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:05,570
bulletproof and just have it talk to the

252
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,849
Wi-Fi maybe with your Internet of Things

253
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,860
light bulbs as long as you don't

254
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,740
actually have you know your gaming

255
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,740
platform your TV and anything that has

256
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,720
your family information on it and then

257
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,900
you got to come out in the world because

258
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,640
even though we're all stuck at home

259
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:25,280
hiding from covet talking to each other

260
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,250
in discord this was meant to be a live

261
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,449
conference where we could actually meet

262
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,580
face to face and learn how to pack

263
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:38,720
together it's been nice having the cat

264
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:41,240
in my lap but I would have I do miss the

265
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,790
chance to have met all of you and we'll

266
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,220
try again next year hopefully in better

267
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:51,020
health for everyone I did say fabulous

268
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:54,740
prizes and this is a challenge coin that

269
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:58,310
I got from besides Philly from a pen

270
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,980
cast others give cash money goodies

271
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,000
badges or attendance the next year's

272
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,560
conference security besides runs

273
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,950
everywhere not just in the US but in the

274
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,479
world if you go to b-side stud org see

275
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,240
if there's something coming up in your

276
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,400
area that has been rescheduled til after

277
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,520
the summer not much is happening this

278
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:23,150
month but once we can all go out without

279
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,579
mask skin we can patch it on hardware

280
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:28,610
and software together the Walker summit

281
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,790
was supposed to be next week out in Fort

282
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,920
Washington it's been shifted to

283
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,469
September 18th to 20th the first one was

284
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,500
out in Atlantic City this is going to be

285
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,480
this

286
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,380
iteration of the conference coming up

287
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,020
now in September there will be a CTF I

288
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,540
had co-wrote one of the b-side CTS with

289
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,300
the organizer of the conference he'll be

290
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,280
volunteering at that event and hope to

291
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,250
see people in September and of course

292
00:14:53,280 --> 00:15:00,480
the Wild West I confessed we have about

293
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:03,780
an hour and a half left before the meta

294
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,550
CTF competition ends and like I said

295
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,530
I've got some great teammates I hope

296
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,620
that you are playing and you have good

297
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:14,970
ones too and we can meet up in September

298
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,360
to play again and then there is the Holy

299
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,290
Grail

300
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:23,160
DEFCON that takes place every year they

301
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,920
hold the culmination of a long CTF

302
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:30,020
process with regional competitions

303
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:33,569
online competitions people have teams of

304
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:36,480
dozens sometimes you know hiding up in

305
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:40,140
hotel rooms through a you know through a

306
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,420
cable link to the rest of their

307
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:46,650
teammates that are actually on the floor

308
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:49,560
and they have cash prizes if you want to

309
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:52,290
do this for the win of more than ego

310
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,020
though that's a goal to reach for so

311
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,120
we've gone through this I said it was

312
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,300
going to be 45 minutes has actually been

313
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,900
25 sorry for the nerves but I do

314
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,109
recommend continuing with checking this

315
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:10,470
out that link or YouTube on your home

316
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:13,070
lab is Jeff McJunkin one of the other

317
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:17,690
presenters here

318
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:21,280
Alys goldfuss is one of my InfoSec

319
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,990
heroes she has been working on a few

320
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:28,459
CTFs over a glass of tea on Sunday

321
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:31,820
mornings the past year and CTF time is a

322
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:34,880
good directory of upcoming events some

323
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,970
online some live and those are

324
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,920
particularly ones that are based on time

325
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,920
limits and prizes
