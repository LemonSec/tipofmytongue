1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,640
all righty buddy it is two o'clock

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,350
mountain time four o'clock Eastern Time

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,739
I'm here with Bryson board and George

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:16,090
are Keeley's that is a lasting or chicas

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:20,300
I know you man it's all good

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,680
and I'd like to welcome both here

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,050
they're gonna give a talk on an

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,370
adversarial emulation with the CG matrix

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,460
thank you very much and take it away

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,070
well we ran a Twitter poll because in

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,230
the olden days of the haxing speakers

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,410
used to get Iced and so with that

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,089
Smirnoff original which is I'm sure just

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,000
as gross and just as tasteless as the

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,770
rest of them is what one so in honor of

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,239
the olden days just like a virtual

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,239
conference we are going to be drinking

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,809
one of these so cheers George you cheer

19
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:53,709
sir oh that tastes horrible oh my god

20
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,709
that's so gross

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,720
now

22
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,720
all right we ready this

23
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:12,280
oh and throw you off all right so

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,199
presenting all right so we are going to

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,439
be talking on adversarial emulation and

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,509
you can see our unicorn is sunny like

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,740
they were in San Diego so we are setting

28
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:24,369
the mindset that we were all in

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,979
California together the key to this talk

30
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:31,270
is we are going to be talking about how

31
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:35,110
to shift from a win centric mindset aka

32
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:38,979
ego driven to business driven or results

33
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:42,009
all too often red team's hackers pen

34
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,950
testers get carried away with trying to

35
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:47,229
win and the industry has started to

36
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,270
shift now where businesses are beginning

37
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,720
to look for results how do we work

38
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,700
together

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,259
of course the arrow is purple for a

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,530
reason what do you think that reason is

41
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,530
George

42
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,950
at a time well sorry so yeah purple is

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,960
uh how my daughter would say how you

44
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,390
make what happens when you combine red

45
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,180
and blue together and really being

46
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,180
efficient and business centric about the

47
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,160
purple team now the grukk we did two

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,990
years ago give a man in O'Day and all of

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,359
access for a day teach a man to fish and

50
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,780
he'll have access for life now I started

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,000
with this tweet for two reasons one

52
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,360
fishing business email compromise is the

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,480
majority access method that attackers

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,600
use in the real world and it works for

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,299
multiple reasons one statistics are in

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,900
my favor I can send you as many fishes

57
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,400
as I want

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,770
they cost difference to send one email

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,840
to 10 million emails is relatively

60
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,920
negligible and statistics are in my

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,750
favor because I just have to get

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,510
somebody to click - this is the theory

63
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,850
of this talk so we're going to be

64
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,579
talking a lot about conceptual framework

65
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,570
we're not going to deep dive into

66
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,390
PowerShell we're not going to deep dive

67
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,739
into any particular framework what we're

68
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,059
going to do is we're going to give you a

69
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,920
different way to look at the problem

70
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,570
we're going to give you a different way

71
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,429
to think through the problem and in

72
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,590
addition we're going to provide you a

73
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,750
number of technical resources that we

74
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,910
have built and shared that we will

75
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,130
continue to populate hopefully with some

76
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,600
of y'all's help after this talk to help

77
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,010
make you better in the long term that's

78
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,319
right

79
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,569
first of all Who am I I'm the unicorn

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,328
guy I'm also on the board of advisors to

81
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:30,450
the army cyber Institute I do some work

82
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,860
for sisa at DHS and I'm a senior fellow

83
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,089
of national security and cyber security

84
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,819
at our street

85
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,720
mostly I'm our industry silly unicorn

86
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:42,720
and I'm George or Gia's I have been in

87
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,599
offensive security for coming up on 10

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,579
years now at a large financial industry

89
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,189
contributions include the common

90
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:52,530
vulnerability scoring system a threat

91
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:55,440
let penetration testing framework that

92
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,319
we use globally for Red Team and

93
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,980
adversary emulation I teach for since I

94
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,629
have a red team course and other

95
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,149
community things like ISS a shout-out to

96
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:08,489
them and way back when I wrote a book on

97
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,799
an operating system you should not be

98
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:15,239
running which is Windows 7 speaking of

99
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,970
books I got some of these to give away

100
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:22,320
in this talk or whoever comes up with

101
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,650
the nice the best question over on the

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,580
channel so that is track 2 talks I'll be

103
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,620
monitoring while Bryson speaks yes so

104
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,270
please participate we love questions we

105
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,680
love comments the heckling probably

106
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,810
won't work so well because you're muted

107
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,360
but we do have several books to give

108
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,580
away on the definitive guide to Red Team

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,090
operations and development written by

110
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,000
Joe vest and James Tuberville alright so

111
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,010
obviously I've talked about who I am a

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,650
little bit but one thing I just kind of

113
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,139
want to create here is the idea that I

114
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,909
believe in the post access space which

115
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,949
is primarily what we're looking at red

116
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,750
teaming that the defender is not as weak

117
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,430
as we all like to think one of the

118
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,970
things that I've always found strange is

119
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,220
why in information security of all of

120
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,449
the disciplines and humankind's is it

121
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,030
the one place where it seems like

122
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,659
somebody else knows my stuff better than

123
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,119
I do

124
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:19,860
and that just continue to to sort of

125
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,990
rattle around in my head and I kept

126
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,020
thinking it can't possibly that can't be

127
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:28,500
true and the first place it's not true

128
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:31,530
is in communications when an attacker

129
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,480
gains access when they pop shell when

130
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,099
they land with a state zero when they

131
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,310
build that state zero up into a

132
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,320
multistage campaigns they start moving

133
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,020
to a place of interest and they need to

134
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,340
communicate one to be able to do that

135
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,049
because they have to have that command

136
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,520
and control to tell it what to do and

137
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,310
also it's kind of hard to steal anything

138
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,270
if you can't take anything out so for

139
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,010
those two reasons they need to

140
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,880
communicate and the way they do that is

141
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,650
over the communications that are already

142
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,840
organic to that enterprise I can't bring

143
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,340
my own wires to the table

144
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,198
and I can't bring my own communication

145
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,599
protocols to the table I have to use

146
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,820
what's already there because if I don't

147
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,190
I stick out and so one of the core

148
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,830
elements of the attacker is blending in

149
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,840
with what's already organic to that

150
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,699
environment how do they talk when do

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,219
they talk what ways do they talk and

152
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,860
being a part of that and then the second

153
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,389
part was well alright so that's that's

154
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,860
limited I can only talk so many ways

155
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,660
there's only so many communication

156
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,150
protocols in the world and companies

157
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,639
aren't gonna be using so many of those

158
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:36,030
what is an attacker do as a part of that

159
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,160
and the capabilities what they do what

160
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,020
they bring to the table that actually

161
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,630
allows them to accomplish their goal is

162
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,909
also bounded there's only so many things

163
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,889
an attacker can do now there might be a

164
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,510
number of ways to do those things but

165
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,419
their behaviors themselves are actually

166
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,070
finite as well and so I came up this

167
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,010
idea that called a bounded attack space

168
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,780
philosophy which is that while

169
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,760
exploitation whether that's technical

170
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,580
whether that's physical whether that's

171
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,969
social my means to get there is infinite

172
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,240
but what I do once I'm there is actually

173
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,950
a finite space of possibility and

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,470
furthermore what's the value of post

175
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,780
exploitation we start looking at post

176
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,270
exploitation we're now primarily dealing

177
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,450
with the largest surface area of every

178
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,330
organization and guess what it's not

179
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,760
technical it's people it's all the

180
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,859
different kinds of users and here we

181
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,840
have a representative example of some of

182
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,280
the different kinds of users from the

183
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,010
folks who don't know how to turn their

184
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,109
computer off and on who the engineers

185
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,630
who always want to be in charge of their

186
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,629
own station do the guy or gal who always

187
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,139
thinks you know what they're doing

188
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:46,969
Elon Musk whatever the hell he's doing

189
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,430
and then of course somebody else that's

190
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:52,010
coming in and doing what they want to do

191
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,230
so now we're gonna get into setting the

192
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,030
classic question of pen test versus

193
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,530
adversary emulation so we're all

194
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,150
speaking the same language

195
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,219
as well as we're gonna delve into some

196
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,469
concepts in this section talking about

197
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,750
some conflict of industry definitions

198
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,790
and terms and those are actually some of

199
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,280
the questions we got so shout out to

200
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,480
juice box and champ that's exactly what

201
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,390
we're gonna talk about here just to

202
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,090
level set we can't just get to adversary

203
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,710
emulation there's a maturity model in a

204
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,659
way to get there and what we found

205
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,580
speaking with a number of you that have

206
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,490
been doing this for a while number of

207
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,530
their organizations is that you start

208
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,870
with vulnerability scanning you scan a

209
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,750
bunch of systems you run your Nexus your

210
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,340
next close whatever born ability scanner

211
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,490
scan whatever if it's a web app and you

212
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,230
get a very long report that's step one

213
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,539
then you actually do vulnerability

214
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,460
assessment that involves a human looking

215
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,980
at those results doing some triaging

216
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:49,220
thinking saying alright this is internal

217
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,960
it's a lab box maybe it's a production

218
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,930
system on the internet and actually

219
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:58,460
doing some correct risk scoring with

220
00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:00,530
cbss do a scoring system and really set

221
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,650
different boundaries as to should this

222
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,630
be fixed today tomorrow in 90 days or

223
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,069
never fixed from there we have

224
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,930
penetration testing and the main

225
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,120
difference there is that you're actually

226
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,130
going to exploit vulnerabilities and

227
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,040
this is really where a lot of us have

228
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,140
been for quite a bit but then regulators

229
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,140
came and kind of water down what a pen

230
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,569
test is and confined us to these very

231
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,910
limited scopes PCI is probably one of

232
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,070
the best examples that you can only ten

233
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,100
test a certain scope within their

234
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,540
environment once a year you only can hit

235
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,910
certain IDs and you can only attack

236
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,939
during certain times and you can't do

237
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:40,459
social engineering so because of that

238
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,460
time the term red teaming was started to

239
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:46,850
be used as a noscope entus or full scope

240
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,980
pen tests where you actually emulate and

241
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,730
do the same tactics techniques and

242
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,980
procedures as a malicious actors that

243
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,320
involves understanding the actor who is

244
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,820
likely to attack you each organizations

245
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,370
can have a different threat model and

246
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,440
then there you get to actually do these

247
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,910
tests

248
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,470
the difference between a red team and a

249
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,890
purple team is that a red team

250
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,720
assessment will be blind that means most

251
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,340
people in the target organization are

252
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,950
not going to know about this you

253
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,050
generally do this for a month to three

254
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,090
months some organizations are doing this

255
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,579
for longer and then you come back at the

256
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,550
end of that with your reports and all

257
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,560
that and you show how you did it and the

258
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,349
blue team gets some value there but

259
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,619
where we're going to is this purple team

260
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,150
concept now all the previous ones these

261
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,650
are still doing right you're not gonna

262
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,780
stop doing more ability scanning you're

263
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,079
not gonna stop doing your pen test or

264
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,970
your blind red team maybe once a year

265
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,160
but you can do some of these purple team

266
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,530
engagements to be more efficient and

267
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,709
purple team is just that combining red

268
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:53,380
and blue set them together and try these

269
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:56,410
TTP's see what should happen what should

270
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,570
be caught what should be detected what

271
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,610
should have an alert maybe at the sock

272
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,320
or instant response should be able to

273
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,840
see and that will make you much more

274
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,520
efficient in the short term to catch

275
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,310
some of these one-offs

276
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,600
in addition orienting you to a format

277
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,160
that were using in this presentation

278
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,920
you'll notice in the bottom right we

279
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,280
have a link that link goes to a much

280
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,290
more extended discussion on the maturity

281
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,750
model here in this case by George or

282
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,370
Jia's and throughout the presentation we

283
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,490
will have additional links for

284
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,590
documentation videos websites all

285
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,900
providing you additional information so

286
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,480
that you can build up your sources after

287
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,640
this talk or further detail so

288
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,860
penetration testing like we discussed is

289
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,860
primarily exploitation focused we're

290
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,410
looking at getting access popping shells

291
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,750
is rewarding there is nothing more fun

292
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,459
than to be sitting there banging away

293
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,220
get something and then just like

294
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,440
wargames the green glow of the terminal

295
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,580
lights you up as you finally get in and

296
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,800
you're on now this change here is that

297
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:03,520
about twenty or thirty years ago this

298
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,459
was all hacking was was a one-person

299
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,040
team focused on exploitation and getting

300
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,330
that shell and there are multiple things

301
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,030
that have changed in the environment

302
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,920
where we still as George discussed one

303
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,120
to look at penetration testing because

304
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,849
it's an important task

305
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,120
of system hardening I'm looking at my

306
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,160
surface area analysis how do I get in

307
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,710
what is my risk to somebody getting in

308
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,480
as I discussed previously though that's

309
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,560
the near infinite space and that's one

310
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,750
of the challenges that we have in

311
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,479
information security is trying to

312
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,990
measure something out of infinity is a

313
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,070
sliding scale furthermore defenses got

314
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,860
good

315
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,769
the software got good the software got

316
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,600
complex and good Microsoft Windows is

317
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:50,480
now a hard target

318
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,889
it used to be Swiss cheese and so that's

319
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,899
one of the reasons that we've now seen

320
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:57,199
the shift where while penetration

321
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:59,630
testing used to be the entire kill cycle

322
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:01,189
kill chain it's no longer anymore and

323
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,470
it's now just a part of an entire chain

324
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,600
furthermore there's a focus on crown

325
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,759
jewels or bus getting to add me getting

326
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,250
domain admin is good but only getting

327
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,279
domain admin is not so good because if I

328
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,560
get in I escalate and I just own domain

329
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,100
and walk out what does the business

330
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,888
learn furthermore that's not necessarily

331
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,009
what we see in the real world or what an

332
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:27,680
adversary is going to do so of course

333
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:29,240
topic here is adversarial emulation what

334
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,130
we're trying to do is getting out of

335
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,630
technically accomplishing something just

336
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,850
interesting that's technical and

337
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,040
understanding in the context of business

338
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,050
results which means we need to look at

339
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,689
what do we see in the real world because

340
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,008
that's the real threat model engagements

341
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,769
are typically shorter for penetration

342
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:47,959
testing because of course a lot of

343
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:49,760
things are compliance driven a lot of

344
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:51,739
folks in information security kind of

345
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,660
sneer at this concept of compliance

346
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,529
driven security because of course we all

347
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,149
know while compliance isn't security

348
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:01,040
compliance is the starting point for a

349
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:03,589
business to legally be able to function

350
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,719
if I have a requirement to go do a pen

351
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:07,490
test to get my check once a year that I

352
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,740
am legally valid as a business to

353
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,360
operate that's the starting point that a

354
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,680
business is going to begin to think of

355
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,730
so red team and penetration testing

356
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,319
internal red team's are going to be

357
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,850
conducting repeated engagement they're

358
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,870
going to be different philosophies

359
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,519
different techniques different

360
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,899
capabilities based on whether you're

361
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,990
internal external for lots of different

362
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:29,000
reasons internal is focused on repeated

363
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,380
engagements of remediation one of the

364
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,269
advantages can be that they have

365
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,620
privileged or insider knowledge because

366
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:36,620
they actually work inside that

367
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,810
organization a lot of organizations try

368
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,509
to almost push their red team to the

369
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,949
side for different reasons and that's

370
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:45,529
that's kind of that constant tension

371
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:47,719
between how do we create a black box

372
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:51,170
test versus a grey box versus a white

373
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,120
box test which will we'll define shortly

374
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,769
and then it the external red team is

375
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,019
useful because it offers a different

376
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,670
perspective they have industry

377
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:01,370
experience so here's a chance to

378
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,630
benchmark okay I'm a financial in what

379
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,399
do I look like compared to other

380
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,800
financials and I can hire a red team

381
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,570
who's had experience doing those kinds

382
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,569
of engagements against other financials

383
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,279
so I can get an industry benchmark the

384
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,790
challenge though of course is these are

385
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,090
incredibly limited by resource and money

386
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,319
so you're gonna get snapshots in time

387
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,770
one of the challenges with the red team

388
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,930
is I can only take do so much in so much

389
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,090
time and so I end up being forced to do

390
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:33,020
what I call more of a surgical strike I

391
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:35,470
have to try to focus on a few things get

392
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,910
in a few places do that quickly

393
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,130
demonstrate my value as fast as possible

394
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,810
because that's all the time I either

395
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,670
have with how much money the clients

396
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,189
willing to spend or how much time the

397
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,260
client is willing to spend and George

398
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,620
you are quite familiar with internal red

399
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,810
team yeah and some very good questions

400
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,540
about doing rotation between red and

401
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,609
blue and does you know do you get

402
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,829
diminishing returns because of the

403
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,590
internal red team and like I said I've

404
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,200
been there for will really have the red

405
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,270
team at this financial for about four to

406
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,340
five years and yes we do know the

407
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,720
environment way better that's why it's

408
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,610
often even though if you have an

409
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,710
internal red team sometimes it's good

410
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,950
maybe every two years or something like

411
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,850
that

412
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:22,400
get a real external red team to come and

413
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,200
and do an adversary emulation to see

414
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,480
what they find the good thing about the

415
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,580
internal red team is that they already

416
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,520
know a lot so they're going to focus

417
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,730
their testing on way more advanced type

418
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,439
of techniques and procedures that they

419
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,540
know will get through and that really

420
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,910
brings out the reasoning of why you

421
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,709
should fix those so I believe both of

422
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,089
them bring value you shouldn't replace

423
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,190
either of them even if you have an

424
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:48,560
internal red team you'll be able to do

425
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,260
more purple teaming for sure but also

426
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,750
contract an external team every once in

427
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,900
a while so that you get that real third

428
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,330
party no strings attached no prior

429
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,850
knowledge tested Reggie

430
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,640
one of the best insights I got on this

431
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,130
was actually at Wild West a confessed in

432
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,630
Deadwood South Dakota last year in

433
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,770
October and there were group of us

434
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,950
sitting around a table and we were

435
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:15,079
talking about conference attendees and

436
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:18,590
Wild West tech fest wild way West

437
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:21,079
hackfest is primarily a conference with

438
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,909
an offensive security focus and it was

439
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,730
interesting though is that means that

440
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,830
probably only about 20 25 percent of the

441
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,650
attendees are actually out of offensive

442
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:34,040
security red team penetration testing

443
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:36,920
seventy eighty percent our blue team or

444
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,030
IT and the other contrast that that was

445
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,460
it was interesting because if you go to

446
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,379
a blue team or an IT conference almost

447
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,630
nobody from offensive security attends

448
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,550
those which I think is a bad thing there

449
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,650
are certainly a lot of folks you don't

450
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,110
typically get started in red team you

451
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,450
usually grow from having learned how an

452
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,870
environment works in fact Jeff McJunkin

453
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,970
who was on this Court earlier today was

454
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,250
talking about how he learned PowerShell

455
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,620
as an exchange administrator before he

456
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,000
went over into offensive security and so

457
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,530
part of what I would like to offer cuz

458
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,780
I'm willing to bet that the hundred or

459
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,178
so attendees that are on right now that

460
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,570
most of you are not actually in the bed

461
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:16,640
team space that one that's okay

462
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,070
sorry I just got distracted cuz Jeff

463
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,440
just tagged me as I called him out that

464
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:24,320
cross training is absolutely applicable

465
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,480
we recommend a process and a framework

466
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,580
here that encourages red and blue to

467
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,080
work together at a doctrinal level but

468
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,059
at that same time at the personal level

469
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,740
we absolutely believe that the two sides

470
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:36,110
should be cross training and sharing

471
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,780
information because that's the best way

472
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,990
to have a business area focus from a

473
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:44,000
blue team side of why does the red team

474
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,559
engagement need to be something that is

475
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,390
binary they go away and they just come

476
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,460
back with results when I think about

477
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,429
purple teaming what I like to think

478
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,140
about is the fact that a red team is

479
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,800
going to be something that is done in

480
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,260
stages

481
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,090
hey let's validate application

482
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,660
whitelisting let's validate application

483
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,280
whitelisting

484
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,200
as many different places as we can

485
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,870
throughout this enterprise and then once

486
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,280
we do that let's whitelist the campaign

487
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,389
that will come together and say hey

488
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,160
here's what we learned

489
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,110
let's fix those things now let's

490
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,440
whitelist this campaign and go to the

491
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:18,320
next level we've now just emulated an

492
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,490
adversary by their ability to defeat

493
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,500
application whitelisting

494
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,050
I didn't have to do anything technically

495
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,309
complicated to do that I just had to

496
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,540
coordinate with the blue team that said

497
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:31,960
alright this executable this I

498
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,629
on script this DLL whatever that payload

499
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,760
is we're going to whitelist it and now

500
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,110
that's the equivalent of the Chinese

501
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,600
defeating our application whitelisting

502
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,709
control and the pic campaign is able to

503
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,860
progress and we're able to do that

504
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,740
collaboratively nobody on this planet is

505
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,409
going to spend the same amount of time

506
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,990
resource or money as a true adversary to

507
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,820
be able to emulate those things so

508
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,590
instead of actually trying to do it at

509
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,540
that level technically it's something

510
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,330
with a simple handshake we can

511
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,790
accomplish the same goal so on that note

512
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,370
this brings up the debate in our

513
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,409
industry about some terms emulation

514
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,060
versus simulation so I'm gonna start

515
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,550
with Tim Malcom Vetter who is the

516
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,580
enterprise red team lead at fortune one

517
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:17,760
and he notes the dictionary definition

518
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,770
of emulation as a reproduction

519
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,620
simulation as an imitation and then the

520
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:26,080
concept of a false flag which is a

521
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,370
covert operation designed to deceive by

522
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,070
creating the appearance of a particular

523
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:34,570
party or group the false flag operations

524
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:37,540
are where I might repurpose malware upon

525
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,310
the Russians I repurpose Chinese malware

526
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,560
and then I launch an attack on America

527
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:44,050
the immediate technical forensic

528
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,720
analysis is going to look like I'm the

529
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:49,180
Chinese because I reused Chinese code

530
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,190
and I've now given a false flag cover of

531
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:54,250
looking like something that I'm not and

532
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,440
he uses this as a call to the red team

533
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,200
because the red team in a false flag

534
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,050
operation is now boss flagging as an

535
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,260
adversary on the other hand we have

536
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:07,260
Caitie nickles who during my talk at

537
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,870
Derby Khan

538
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,450
quote emulation is sort of in the spirit

539
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:15,689
of but we can never match adversaries

540
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:19,650
exactly whereas simulation applies it's

541
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:22,980
an exact match so here we have contrary

542
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:25,050
indicating terms around emulation versus

543
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,410
emulation and to make things even more

544
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,940
complicated we have more simulation with

545
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,640
the breach and attack simulation space

546
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,520
where we now have different definitions

547
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,530
of what simulation is and so what I

548
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,080
would offer is the reason that we chose

549
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,450
the name emulation and adversarial

550
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,460
emulation is because I believe that

551
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,910
there's two levels that we're talking

552
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,300
about

553
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:52,110
one is where am i trying to replicate

554
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:55,260
the techniques tactics and procedures of

555
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:58,320
an adversary that I want to measure my

556
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:02,010
defensive controls against the other is

557
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,870
what exactly am i doing on a network or

558
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:09,480
a host computer so for example if I am

559
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:12,810
going to do ransomware I can't actually

560
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,780
do ransomware on a user's host computer

561
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:18,860
because no assessment should ever impact

562
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,200
operation so how do I effectively

563
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:25,080
simulate ransomware on a computer

564
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,880
without effectively ransomware in the

565
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,399
computer and the example that I give and

566
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,260
you can look at this up online where

567
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,870
I've demonstrated it is creating

568
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:37,170
arbitrary files using local encryption

569
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,270
to encrypt those files calling back to

570
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,400
by c2 server that I'm conducting the red

571
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:43,620
team operation from so I've host in

572
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,080
network activities tied to ransomware

573
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,570
but I haven't actually affected the

574
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,550
users computer so just kind of two

575
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,320
different levels between actual

576
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,470
operation of what happens on a computer

577
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,639
and then where I'm trying to replicate

578
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:01,140
the TTP's of an adversary that's a lot

579
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,760
of where we have this industry confusion

580
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,190
tied in to of course what force during

581
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,690
Gartner think that this is anything you

582
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,460
want to add there George yeah I'm

583
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,930
actually just reading through a lot of

584
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,030
people say you know a lot of these are

585
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:15,270
just buzzwords that I think in spirit

586
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,040
we're all agreeing that what we want to

587
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,690
do is understand how an adversary works

588
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,379
which is what we're gonna jump into

589
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,090
right now

590
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,410
emulate that or actually

591
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,080
that whether you want to call it

592
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,880
simulator me lake and improve at the end

593
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,280
of the day to improve the blue team

594
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,560
improve your detection then your

595
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,350
alerting your prevention and your people

596
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,970
and processes it's a comment on these

597
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,189
being buzzwords of marketing jargon

598
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,710
certainly you're going to find that

599
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,020
challenge throughout there are lots of

600
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,450
vendors lots of products all competing

601
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,550
to try to communicate their own goals

602
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,590
and their own agendas but I would argue

603
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,020
that in the practitioner community it's

604
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,459
really important that we try to come to

605
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,590
a common understanding of what we mean

606
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,110
and why that confusion is because at the

607
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:00,510
end of the day it's our responsibility

608
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:03,209
to protect our businesses that's what

609
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:05,010
we're hired for yeah and not and not let

610
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,020
it get watered down like we left

611
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,440
penetration test and get water down to

612
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:13,680
mean one IP address and just a little

613
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,810
bit of exploitation here they're the

614
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,370
proverbial missus scan report is a pen

615
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:22,500
test me exactly so what do we need to do

616
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,409
to be able to effectively do adversary

617
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,200
emulation so the key here is one

618
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,690
flexibility because I need to be able to

619
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,880
change what I'm doing at the host and

620
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,830
the network level to be able to

621
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,180
replicate and I keep using replicate

622
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,449
because I'm now avoiding the use of the

623
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,340
term it emulation to emulate that

624
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,710
particular adversary and it needs to be

625
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,740
repeatable and the reason it needs to be

626
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,960
repeatable is that this should not be a

627
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,030
one-off this becomes something that when

628
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,760
I've created that particular view of an

629
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:55,980
adversary I'm able to share that with

630
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,210
DevOps I'm able to share that with the

631
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,040
stock I'm able to share that with the

632
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,320
blue team so that's something that they

633
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,770
can take away and work around and I

634
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,169
build up my own baseline and library of

635
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:09,030
my organization's emulated campaigns to

636
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,770
be able to do that so we talked about

637
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,330
customization I need to be able to

638
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,639
change command and control I need to be

639
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,290
able to change what I'm doing

640
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,570
repeatable this helps me start to

641
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:20,550
establish metrics of performance because

642
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,740
the reality is that that organization is

643
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:25,080
always changing and with that change is

644
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,090
going to be the potential degradation of

645
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,550
controls one thing I always like to

646
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,280
point out to folks is how confident are

647
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,980
you that controls are uniform throughout

648
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,629
your enterprise which means that however

649
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,490
you feel you are protecting all of the

650
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,890
employees in that company particularly

651
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:43,350
an international multinational company

652
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:46,169
do you think that the controls are all

653
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,780
implemented equally across all of those

654
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,580
computers

655
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,049
kill chain incite so this is where I

656
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:55,340
talked about finding the defensive

657
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:57,710
contours where can I move down the kill

658
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,049
chain of determining what works and what

659
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,289
doesn't and then together moving past

660
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:04,908
that and then moving past that and then

661
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:06,140
automatable so one of the challenges of

662
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:08,750
course that we all have in our industry

663
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:13,010
is the fact that we want to be able to

664
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:15,590
make it easier or new folks or junior

665
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,299
folks to come up to speed and so part of

666
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,850
what I propose here is that you need to

667
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:23,000
have this balance in your organization

668
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:26,120
of the very knowledgeable experts who

669
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,490
can build out these capabilities who can

670
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,889
define them with whatever set of tools

671
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,870
that you're using and that those can be

672
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,909
pushed down so that more junior

673
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:39,020
operators can work within those limits

674
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:41,270
and operate them on the environment

675
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,930
so we talked briefly on white box versus

676
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:47,510
black box this is contentious compart of

677
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:50,300
the way we do things so white box is I

678
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,490
have full insider knowledge I am given

679
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,850
all of the details for me to be able to

680
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:59,180
begin like a well-established adversary

681
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:01,520
versus black box which means I just know

682
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,840
the company I'm looking at and I have to

683
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,950
begin reconnaissance and intelligence

684
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:09,139
collection to conduct my campaign part

685
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,960
of what I think confuses this is one

686
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,210
this is a little bit of a mix of surface

687
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,960
area analysis and penetration testing

688
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:20,060
but my personal opinion on it is that I

689
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,530
think all red teams should start from my

690
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,679
white box perspective because I'm

691
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,520
primarily looking at the business

692
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,620
potential risk

693
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,260
what is that contextual risk of what

694
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,850
happens once you get in there's no risk

695
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,950
to reconnaissance there's just a

696
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,750
question of what can you find and the

697
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,240
reality is going back to that nobody is

698
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,730
ever going to invest the same amount of

699
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,030
resources in time as a committed

700
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,620
adversary I'm not aware of any red team

701
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,870
that's ever been hired for a two to five

702
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,030
year red team to do a patient and

703
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,820
stealthy reconnaissance that also

704
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,770
includes interacting with human assets

705
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,629
for information so this is just my

706
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,400
personal view on why I think that red

707
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,120
team should start with a white box

708
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,280
perspective and there's absolutely

709
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,679
nothing lost by even beginning your red

710
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,750
team with set points within the

711
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,090
enterprise I know several large

712
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,520
companies that the bet team begins from

713
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,409
random hosts inside the enterprise and

714
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,990
they begin from there because they just

715
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:20,630
assume access defense validation of

716
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,550
question right about this of why should

717
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,680
we automate this and I think it's fairly

718
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:27,260
a great slide to answer that question

719
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,810
let you know that people are asking okay

720
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,580
do you want to take it this goes back to

721
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,649
the question someone just has to blow

722
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:37,399
what's the value of automating some of

723
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:39,110
these tests if there are TTP's and the

724
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,710
reason for that is that we want our red

725
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:46,159
teams to focus on and think and continue

726
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:48,890
to find new and new and interesting ways

727
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,260
of being able to do certain procedures

728
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,310
certain techniques the example I want to

729
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,010
give was that we

730
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:58,500
found a particular issue and it required

731
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:01,470
a lot of moving parts to get there so

732
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,570
for instance a certain log a certain

733
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,760
event ID had to get turned on then that

734
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,010
event ID have to be logged locally then

735
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,320
it have to be sent to a log aggregator

736
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:13,020
from there had to be sent to a sim do

737
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,210
some sort of security analytics and then

738
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,430
eventually actually show up further

739
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,290
level one analyst to see because it's a

740
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,640
TTP you can't prevent it's just

741
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,280
something we have to live with but we

742
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,770
have to detect it and one of the reasons

743
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,420
why we automated this and we created an

744
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,760
automated method of doing that

745
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:32,310
particular TTP we were able to give that

746
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,010
to the engineers they would run it see

747
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,690
if that correct log was running they did

748
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,450
that multiple times way better than

749
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,730
having a red team or drop a C to go

750
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,550
through and do or run an atomic red team

751
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:47,100
etc then once they get back to their

752
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:49,230
correct logging send it to the correct

753
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,520
place make sure that it's traversing the

754
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,500
network getting to where it needs to

755
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,389
then make sure that the analytics were

756
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,240
working they told me they ended up

757
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:59,070
running this over 30 times during that

758
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,360
time normally in tradition you'd have

759
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,820
your right team just redoing this

760
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,209
redoing this redoing this in this case

761
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,439
we can have them execute this particular

762
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,650
controlled you know kind of synthetic

763
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,570
type malware and be able to test it

764
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,790
themselves and while our red team got to

765
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:17,220
focus on another so it's not even

766
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,230
control validation at that point it's

767
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,270
really making sure it works then once

768
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:23,130
you do have the control you can automate

769
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:26,310
that control validation pieces make sure

770
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:28,290
nothing actually stops working right and

771
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,419
you can do this for various TTP's and

772
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:33,050
what we'll get to the threat Intel part

773
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:36,720
my turret acts early so back to you guys

774
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:39,210
yeah so to emphasize there one that

775
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,340
helps me build a library that the entire

776
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,720
organization can start to use because I

777
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,149
think that when we're looking at this

778
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,250
defense outlet validation the red team's

779
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,110
goal is to constantly be able to emulate

780
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,570
the latest and greatest threat to that

781
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,429
organization and I emphasize that to

782
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,889
that organization because not everything

783
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,650
is a threat everybody probably the best

784
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,970
example I can give of that is actually

785
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,560
so this morning I was having a

786
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,380
conversation with somebody and they were

787
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:07,330
talking about hey nobody has ever looked

788
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:10,000
at the threats to mining equipment

789
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,379
and my first comment was well what's the

790
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,820
threat bottle there I would say the

791
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,020
threat there is more likely that

792
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,149
somebody is going to be stealing

793
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,060
equipment versus that somebody is going

794
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:21,910
to try to manipulate this close access

795
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,919
industrial control equipment so just

796
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,240
because something can be done doesn't

797
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,680
mean it's something you have to worry

798
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,350
about we can't worry about all of the

799
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,240
things so we need to find ways to reduce

800
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,730
that burden for ourselves by automating

801
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,240
as much as possible and do that that

802
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,860
that part is the emulating the behavior

803
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,140
so in this example we talked about wanna

804
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,590
cry if I go and get a sample of one a

805
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,680
cry

806
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:47,260
I can validate myself against that exact

807
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,400
sample so first problem we have in this

808
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,080
ties into a challenge for threat

809
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,730
intelligence is that sample is going to

810
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,530
have a particular hash it's going to

811
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,970
behave a certain way it's going to go to

812
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,580
a particular IP or domain

813
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,020
well attackers already know that you're

814
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,000
going to catch this stuff which is why

815
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:04,180
they already build in the ability to

816
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,170
shift those things it's relatively easy

817
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:11,710
to create new signatures it's also not

818
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:13,540
that difficult to defeat signature ink

819
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,040
techniques that defenders use so I can

820
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,760
even be the same thing and look like a

821
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,139
different thing to you

822
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,330
and then it's not hard for me to

823
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,520
constantly have changing bounce nodes

824
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:24,110
and ip's and different things this is

825
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,670
part of one of the reasons why botnets

826
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,909
can also be particularly interesting

827
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:32,150
because they provide me my own basic tor

828
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:35,330
net for of consumer products for c2 and

829
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:37,490
so the goal here is being able to look

830
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,500
at ransomware behaviors versus just a

831
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,870
particular kind of ransomware is the

832
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,700
emulation that we want to do and then

833
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,530
the executive perspective on defense

834
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,060
validation is they're looking to

835
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,399
validate their investment in products

836
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:52,159
they've spent a certain amount of money

837
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,720
on tech on process and on people and

838
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,320
what they would like to know what works

839
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,780
and what doesn't

840
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,659
going back to the comment on marketing

841
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,280
jargon what am I actually getting versus

842
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,770
the snake-oil of what I've been sold I

843
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,230
cannot tell you how many places that

844
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:09,050
have spent seven digits on a particular

845
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,730
product we go and we do a particular

846
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,360
test and they come back and they go oh

847
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,490
my god

848
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,389
we're spending this amount of money and

849
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,650
it didn't even catch that bear on one

850
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,450
hand there's no worse feeling in the

851
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,010
world then realizing you spent a lot of

852
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,470
money for something that didn't deliver

853
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,220
on the other hand it's really good to

854
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,890
know the truth

855
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,480
so as hard as it is to call that the

856
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,490
emperor has no clothes this is the

857
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,220
executive interest in being able to do

858
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:37,190
this and then validating the investments

859
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:39,710
in people so a lot of things when we

860
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,840
look at this the goal across the

861
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,330
defensive matrix of what does a red team

862
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,159
do it's looking at protection it's look

863
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,439
at detection and then it's looking at

864
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,750
response so a part of that could be is

865
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,220
my sock awake are they able to see these

866
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,300
things what should they have seen and

867
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,670
when should they have been able to see

868
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,250
it or in the case of most businesses

869
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:00,800
because the majority of businesses don't

870
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,030
have their own internal sock what am I

871
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,649
getting for the money that I'm spending

872
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,899
with that managed service security

873
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,960
provider are they meeting their SLA are

874
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,850
they able to catch the obvious things

875
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,590
the threat intelligence today threat

876
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,259
intelligence today is primarily driven

877
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:17,659
by static identifiers and the reality is

878
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,540
those things are constantly changing so

879
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:23,210
it's disappointing so one of my points

880
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,909
on this is for us as an industry to be

881
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,190
able to adapt we should not have the

882
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:30,060
burden as practitioners in the red team

883
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,609
and purple team space to

884
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,859
and read a forty to sixty page analyst

885
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:36,899
report to try to pull out the

886
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:39,480
information for us to be able to emulate

887
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:42,000
an adversary so one piece of work that

888
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,159
came out at last year's attack on mitre

889
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,469
published an open-source toolkit called

890
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,899
tram tram does natural language

891
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:50,609
processing to go through those reports

892
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:53,520
and try to bubble that up for you I

893
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:54,869
think that's a good first step I would

894
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,270
argue that the threat intelligence

895
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:59,369
industry needs to adapt even further and

896
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:02,460
they need to be creating not lengthy

897
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:05,520
endless reports but machine readable for

898
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:08,599
emulation so instead of producing a 60

899
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,250
page report they produce some sort of

900
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:13,950
sticks or yarra like format that we're

901
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,570
able to ingest automatically and that's

902
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,879
something that we can put into all of

903
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,590
our tools so one of the things we're

904
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,619
going to talk about here quickly it

905
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:24,920
shortly is one of the tools that George

906
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:27,930
and I and several others created to help

907
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,859
catalog and identify all of the command

908
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,319
and control frameworks that are

909
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:34,589
available out there both open source as

910
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,450
well as proprietary and my point here is

911
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:38,220
that if the threat intelligence industry

912
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,770
creates a standard for all of us to

913
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,990
build - then all of those frameworks can

914
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:45,000
now look to ingest that to automatically

915
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:48,240
be able to replicate whatever they're

916
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,550
trying to do and of course you can't get

917
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,009
by without one reference through the

918
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,930
pyramid of painting by David Bianco the

919
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,910
challenge here of course is threat

920
00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:00,060
intelligence at the bottom of hash IPs

921
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:02,220
and domains needs to grow up toward the

922
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,440
techniques tactics and procedures which

923
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,720
is really difficult to do given the

924
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,310
current state of affairs and then the

925
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,709
final piece is one of the riskiest ways

926
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,660
of doing this is neutered malware where

927
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,240
I go out take a sample of something

928
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,549
bring it in reverse engineer it make

929
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,930
sure that it's not harmful as well as

930
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,030
make sure that is something I control

931
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:23,310
and now I can throw that exact same code

932
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:26,130
out into my environment here is a great

933
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,810
example this is a call out to Katy Katy

934
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,720
no longer works at mitre actually Katy

935
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,910
now works at red canary though thumbs up

936
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,629
Katy but while she was at mitre she

937
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:38,430
created this idea of how to look at a

938
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,440
traditional threat intelligence report

939
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,089
pull it out and then automatically

940
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,710
correlate it using the mitre attack

941
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:46,080
matrix which is where we see

942
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,640
these different designations so now I

943
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,480
have the ability to start to look at

944
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,190
what are the metadata of a threat to be

945
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,010
able to emulate it which leads us right

946
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,110
into mitre attack probably just about

947
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,480
everything these days is centered around

948
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:02,820
mitre attack minor attack is one of the

949
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,890
major hot frameworks that everybody's

950
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,300
going with most of it that you've seen

951
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,370
is all enterprise attack which is

952
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,830
focused on delivery on through

953
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,390
they are fleshing out pre attack and in

954
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,610
addition they're also building out an

955
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,140
attack framework for ICS that was

956
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,020
published at the end of last year

957
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,509
so what mitre attack does for us and

958
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,790
this goes back to that save some of the

959
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:25,860
same challenges we have in industry one

960
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,440
example of simulation would be that I

961
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:31,020
run a box in here like account

962
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,500
manipulation so account manipulation in

963
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,750
persistence the then trying to do bypass

964
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,030
user account control and the point is

965
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,310
that I will I will run this and I will

966
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:43,380
get a score and then I will run bypass

967
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,000
user account and control and get a score

968
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,340
and then I will do something else

969
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,100
separately my argument is that's not

970
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,380
emulation because if you look at the way

971
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:56,040
an attacker works an attacker is going

972
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,740
to be state based my ability to do

973
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,020
access token manipulation in privilege

974
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,149
escalation is going to be dependent on

975
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,470
what information I've gathered from

976
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,750
being able to do one of these other

977
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:08,549
techniques my ability to do lateral

978
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,590
movement is going to be radically

979
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,960
different if I have privileges versus I

980
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,520
don't and so the way I like to think

981
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,110
about this is the mitre attack framework

982
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,720
should be looked at like a periodic

983
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,910
table of elements the individual

984
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,100
elements combined together create a

985
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,710
chemical equation which is my ability to

986
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,830
emulate an adversary them individually

987
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:31,590
are just inert objects so on top of that

988
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:33,299
they've also published sub techniques so

989
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,460
in addition to the high-level periodic

990
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,920
table there's now a lot more depth in

991
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,230
each one of those squares to go into the

992
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,630
sub techniques that that matched that so

993
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:44,280
just something to be aware of I like the

994
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,140
good thing about this is miter attack

995
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,390
gives us a common language now to

996
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,330
describe attacks and discuss what's

997
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:53,390
happening but the challenge is don't get

998
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,370
into a box focus

999
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,589
don't get into a rigid adherence to what

1000
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:00,529
you think is in the framework and there

1001
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:03,170
is no way to just blanket test across

1002
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,090
all of mitre attack and don't get caught

1003
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:07,850
up in you know we're green in this box

1004
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:10,790
but yellow in this box it's it's it's

1005
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:13,580
good as a way to describe what's

1006
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:16,160
happening but do not do not over focus

1007
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:20,060
on it and with that we're gonna go to

1008
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,810
George with the c2 matrix w w SC 2

1009
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:27,170
matrix comm this started originally

1010
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:28,310
started when the folks over at Specter

1011
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,650
off said that they weren't going to

1012
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:33,950
support Empire anymore this was around

1013
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:36,020
june july 2019 and i went and asked some

1014
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,720
smart people like just McJunkin who's on

1015
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:41,000
here and Tim and Ed and a few people I

1016
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,490
say hey what other seaters do you use I

1017
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,400
got a different answer for every person

1018
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:48,560
then started just asking around more and

1019
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,050
more and found them quite a bit of SI

1020
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,360
toos without real really knowing which

1021
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,920
ones worked all of them get hub code

1022
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,610
that you have to read quite a bit into

1023
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,740
and then talking with Bryson uh-uh

1024
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:03,920
what was that I was Derby con Derby con

1025
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,180
bird buggy of other other SI toos I

1026
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,280
think you were playing with caldera at

1027
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,589
that point or trying to play with

1028
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,740
caldera at that point I think it was pre

1029
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:14,180
version 2 and we just started

1030
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,759
brainstorming of how cool it would be if

1031
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,589
you had a list of all the SI toos with

1032
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,970
all the different features because so

1033
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:22,100
far we've talked about getting threat

1034
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,589
Intel finding an adversary that's going

1035
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:27,529
to likely to attack you getting out

1036
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:29,810
those TTP's and then figuring out which

1037
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:32,510
situ or what framework you can use that

1038
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:34,400
would emulate most closely to whatever

1039
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,110
adversary you want to do and that's

1040
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,970
where this came out as you can see on

1041
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,500
the screenshot here we have a number of

1042
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:41,810
different factors I think we look at

1043
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,270
over 30 different things in particular

1044
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:46,700
focusing on the command and control

1045
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:48,590
channel what protocols are used if you

1046
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,120
read thread into and malware and we'll

1047
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:53,090
cover this shortly you'll see a lot of

1048
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:58,549
is over HTTP but you see a number of

1049
00:40:53,090 --> 00:41:02,570
them using others like HTTP to SMB ICMP

1050
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:05,090
DNS over HTTP totally just bringing all

1051
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:07,190
these together there's 35 of them right

1052
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,530
now as you can see it it's all

1053
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,869
completely full and every time we get

1054
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:14,000
close to filling this matrix a new one

1055
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:16,700
gets released generally on a Friday

1056
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,339
afternoon so it's a fun little project

1057
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:23,450
it's been taking out quite a bit you can

1058
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:25,099
follow it at c2 matrix on twitter and if

1059
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:28,339
you go to the next slide I want to talk

1060
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:31,400
about a release we're gonna do right now

1061
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:33,799
so one of the things I kept hearing when

1062
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,960
we brought out the c2 matrix was how do

1063
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,420
you actually get these installed how do

1064
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,760
you make them run where the basics and

1065
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:44,599
what we're releasing today is the how-to

1066
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,240
so how to dot the C 2 matrix com it

1067
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:49,460
started it's populated only for wild who

1068
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,439
has hackfest so you're the first people

1069
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:54,140
to see this and you can actually go

1070
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,000
through and click on any of the C twos

1071
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,700
and they'll tell you how to get it

1072
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,510
installed how to run it and some of the

1073
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:05,779
basics around a listener and agent how

1074
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,579
to create that payload etc we also have

1075
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,470
a couple other things coming out because

1076
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:11,420
if you've ever tried to install any of

1077
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,910
these you know they aren't as

1078
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,859
straightforward as possible so as a sans

1079
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:18,680
instructor working with sans we are

1080
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:22,700
coming out with the slingshot C 2 matrix

1081
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,740
Edition which will have the top 10 C

1082
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,230
twos that we believe most people used

1083
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:30,950
also been working with the folks over at

1084
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:34,760
offensive security Kali Linux already

1085
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:37,009
has PowerShell Empire 3.1 or actually

1086
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:42,050
three one zero it is supported now by

1087
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:46,280
team called BC security but by 2022 it

1088
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:48,980
will have 11 C twos on there so uh this

1089
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,270
is really allowing everyone to test

1090
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,270
these out all these are open source

1091
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:56,780
already most of them are and then really

1092
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,810
the next phase is more strategic view on

1093
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,760
how to use the C to matrix which

1094
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:05,630
involves attack mapping an adversary

1095
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,150
mapping so if we say a your your C so

1096
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:10,670
comes and says you know January 5th

1097
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:13,940
first day back from work or to work from

1098
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:16,550
the holidays these Iranian threat actors

1099
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,450
are high risk now because of the current

1100
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:21,570
global affairs

1101
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:23,910
what can a PT 33 and 34

1102
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:26,820
you can look at the matrix and say

1103
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:29,430
alright the C tubes are most likely

1104
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:32,220
recover these TTP's are these go to the

1105
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:36,089
how-to to end test them out and actually

1106
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:38,609
have valid results for improving your

1107
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:41,580
detective and preventive controls so all

1108
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:44,820
that's available right now how to not

1109
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:47,060
the c2 matrix to work in progress we do

1110
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:51,390
appreciate everyone's feedback and

1111
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:53,640
contributions we also have these c2

1112
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,160
matrix stickers I wish I can give you

1113
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,890
all but if you contribute I've heard

1114
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,299
that you magically receive stickers at

1115
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,930
your house I don't know how that works

1116
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:05,910
but uh contributors have have been

1117
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:08,430
saying that they're receiving themselves

1118
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:12,690
pretty cool back to you guys

1119
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:14,850
so emphasis here one this is a community

1120
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,230
driven effort George and I and all the

1121
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,770
others are not able to do this on our

1122
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,140
own

1123
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:20,100
there are new C to matrix excuse me

1124
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,259
there are new C two frameworks

1125
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,850
constantly coming out there are updates

1126
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,490
to the ones that are currently in there

1127
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:28,589
there are a lot of new ideas that we've

1128
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,359
been debating for the last few months on

1129
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:33,240
where we want to take this idea even

1130
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,100
further we are looking for folks to get

1131
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,770
involved in to help we want folks

1132
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:40,650
testing we want folks writing how to's

1133
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:43,170
we want folks crafting how to emulate

1134
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,570
specific threats obviously we are going

1135
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:47,880
to be releasing here and short bit some

1136
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:49,650
new distributions which will make it

1137
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,780
even easier because a lot of these will

1138
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,790
already be installed for you so please

1139
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,450
reach out work with us to help make this

1140
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:58,430
better for everybody in the community

1141
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,348
what are the ones that I called out here

1142
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:02,149
is called Dara and since we're short on

1143
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:04,430
time this fortunately I'm not going to

1144
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:06,349
do a big demo but we provided some

1145
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:07,970
videos and some documentation walking

1146
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:10,369
through even more detail than what's

1147
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:13,730
currently available on the c2 Matrix

1148
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:16,250
website so the github for it all of the

1149
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:18,109
docs so the good news is caldera is free

1150
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:21,140
you'll notice they even say adversary

1151
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:23,960
emulation in their github so we're on a

1152
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:25,339
good site the bad news is this is the

1153
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,190
object tree for caldera

1154
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:29,990
it's his fairly complicated which is all

1155
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,210
one of the reasons that this is a pretty

1156
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:34,220
powerful tool I would summarize that

1157
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:36,560
this is a great tool to practice in a

1158
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:39,290
lab a lot of the things that are

1159
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,070
required for installation so here are

1160
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,859
some of the things you need for

1161
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:44,780
execution make it difficult to use in a

1162
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:47,598
production environment but it is a

1163
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,310
fantastic tool for emulation in a lab

1164
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,470
environment has a lot of capability and

1165
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:54,740
you'll notice the links down at the

1166
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:57,859
bottom though on the left side is a

1167
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:00,379
thorough walkthrough written walkthrough

1168
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:02,150
that we are sharing on us setting up

1169
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:04,819
specific campaigns and how to do that

1170
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:08,000
and then on the right is a link to the

1171
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:10,550
video for that quickly going through do

1172
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,670
you notice any trends here HTTP

1173
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:16,369
obviously rules the day these are all

1174
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:19,640
available for sale for almost nothing

1175
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:21,920
these are still in operation years later

1176
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,660
because they still work I talked about

1177
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,329
network activities being a finite space

1178
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:28,279
the emphasis I would put on here is the

1179
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:31,490
one place that an adversary can never

1180
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:34,069
fool you because they have to bend the

1181
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:36,500
laws of physics is on the wire at the

1182
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:38,630
network when I go down to become a 1 & 0

1183
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,760
I become a 1 and 0 like everybody else

1184
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:43,300
it's only by blending in with the

1185
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,250
traffic that I can try to be clever

1186
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:48,349
lateral movement of course is the most

1187
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:51,500
common thing to look for almost no

1188
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:53,569
adversary ends where they want to excuse

1189
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,099
me starts where they want to they begin

1190
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:56,210
wherever they begin they have to get

1191
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:58,369
where they need to get which means they

1192
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,990
have to pivot throughout and so there's

1193
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:01,339
pivoting there's password spraying a lot

1194
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,319
of folks don't look for that internally

1195
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:05,450
use of vulnerabilities inside and then

1196
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:06,980
of course just basic tricks looking at

1197
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,509
the combination then from a defensive

1198
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,380
perspective is understanding should

1199
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,730
these things be talking

1200
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,610
should these things be on the same

1201
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:17,940
network segmentation is your friend post

1202
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:19,650
activities we talked about this or the

1203
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,140
purple team that we're gonna skip real

1204
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,480
quick here to George doing a very fast

1205
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,759
summary of an actual purple team

1206
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,900
exercise actually got awesome questions

1207
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,700
I want to thank everyone that's been

1208
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,980
putting in questions because we've been

1209
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,140
able to answer them subliminally about

1210
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,390
while we're still doing the slide so

1211
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,100
purple team exercises one of the things

1212
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:40,680
that someone commented is you know in

1213
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,390
your maturity module can you just jump -

1214
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,890
purple team and not do red team or do

1215
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,500
red team after and the answer is yes

1216
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,930
it's just how some organizations matured

1217
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,330
there are a number of them that it went

1218
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:53,549
from pen testing to purple teaming and

1219
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:55,560
then doing blind right team so by all

1220
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:57,720
means whatever gets you there gets you

1221
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,850
there the purple team exercise is the

1222
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,669
way that we did it was blind test first

1223
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:05,130
we're blue team hated the red team

1224
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:09,390
because we were internal and we come in

1225
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:11,610
and win and that was our thought process

1226
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,879
back then right was about winning and

1227
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:17,520
that's not the goal the goal is to make

1228
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,590
blue better to make your detective and

1229
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,180
preventive controls better to train and

1230
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:23,100
improve your people process and

1231
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,990
technology so we started doing these

1232
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,970
purple team exercises in the first one

1233
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:29,129
had to be in person just because of the

1234
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:31,740
psychological and the history behind it

1235
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:34,110
where it was very adversarial between

1236
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,520
blue and red there's an entire talk here

1237
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,580
on the bottom right that you can check

1238
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:42,150
out and what's important about a purple

1239
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:44,370
team exercise is to choose those tactics

1240
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:46,530
techniques and procedures correctly you

1241
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:48,630
don't want to choose TTP's that you know

1242
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:52,080
aren't gonna get caught by anything you

1243
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:54,420
actually want to see TPS that will be

1244
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,730
detected but not necessarily prevented

1245
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,890
and especially doing this early on so it

1246
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:01,770
takes a lot of planning ahead of time

1247
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:04,620
most red team exercises do as well a lot

1248
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:07,560
of talks just focus on no initial access

1249
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:09,779
and defense evasion but the actual prep

1250
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,360
time or a purple team or a red team

1251
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,220
exercise could be four weeks could be

1252
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,410
eight weeks and there's where you want

1253
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:18,149
to choose these TTP's and ensure that

1254
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:20,430
you're bringing battle so start with

1255
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:22,650
those TTP's that you know you detect but

1256
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,299
requires a person to actually action and

1257
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,980
then move on to

1258
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,660
something more sophisticated or

1259
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,790
something that should work something

1260
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:32,100
that might not work really depending on

1261
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:34,230
what you want to do so like I mentioned

1262
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,779
there's a whole talk I did at the Sands

1263
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:38,820
purple team summit slides are there for

1264
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:41,000
running an in-person purple team II but

1265
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,350
they're definitely high value and then

1266
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,850
Sina will be doing a presentation on

1267
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:46,560
thought card I've actually been giving

1268
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:48,480
her a number of the lessons learned so

1269
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,090
she's gonna have more examples there as

1270
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,540
well but definitely bringing value is

1271
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:56,660
the reason we do all of this is to

1272
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,770
improve the defenses of our

1273
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:01,049
organizations or your customers of your

1274
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:03,540
third party it's not just about winning

1275
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:06,270
which is exactly how Bryson's started

1276
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,100
the conversation today and if you do

1277
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,540
want a little more on this this is my

1278
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,180
shameless plug I am a sentient

1279
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,130
instructor and there's a two-day red

1280
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,930
team exercise an adversary emulation

1281
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,690
course where we do everything we just

1282
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:21,149
talked about we use threat Intel by luck

1283
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:23,670
of the draw I chose an Iranian threat

1284
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:26,280
actor so well it was very timely in

1285
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:29,340
these past three months to emulate apt

1286
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,530
33 in the course we use Empire but you

1287
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:33,750
learn all the basics and lovely

1288
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,730
obviously we cover the c2 matrix so it's

1289
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:38,490
a two-day course

1290
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:40,500
5050 so all hands-on and you go into

1291
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:43,259
from initial access all the way to

1292
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,930
action on objectives and it's a lot of

1293
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:48,720
fun so reach out if you want to do that

1294
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:51,980
sans announced today that they will be

1295
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:55,709
moving all there in person courses and

1296
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:58,740
conferences between now June 1st to

1297
00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:00,810
virtual so we'll still be supporting the

1298
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,279
community and anyone that signs up so

1299
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:06,470
hopefully we see you there

1300
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,470
Mattie Bryson we're done
