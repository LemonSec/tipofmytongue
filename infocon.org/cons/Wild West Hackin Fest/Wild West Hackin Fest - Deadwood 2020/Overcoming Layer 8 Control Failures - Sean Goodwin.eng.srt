1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,689
all right we got sean is here overcoming

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
eight control failures engaging your

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,640
staff and the fight against cyber

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,910
criminals you ready I'm ready

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,189
you sure yeah hey can't cyber criminals

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,439
is easy right that's the easy part right

7
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:19,910
the taxis player hates that's the hard

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,679
part

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,109
yeah once it's the money then you get

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,369
the people then you get the technology I

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,499
might be getting that whole thing wrong

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,779
but it's late in the day all right sir

13
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:32,910
with that please take it away

14
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:36,300
awesome thank you the idea for this talk

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,819
and I know it's a quick slot so you know

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,149
I'll post those slides in that download

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,449
channel shortly really the intent I was

18
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,750
looking to recover here is you know

19
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:50,750
technology is

20
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,970
most of what we do and we can spend a

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,400
lot of time focusing on securing the

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,860
technology and then we all know it falls

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,480
back to you send a phishing email you

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,730
place a phone call and someone just

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,369
hands you their credentials and all that

26
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,619
time and money spent on the latest and

27
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:09,110
greatest technology was all for nothing

28
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,240
right that's what I wanted to do is

29
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,270
leverage some of the experience I have

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,570
if I'll talk about the obligatory BIOS

31
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,789
slide here main takeaway two things

32
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,580
really one being that I work in an IP

33
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,020
assurance and security consulting

34
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,619
organization so that puts me in probably

35
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,509
fifty to sixty different is a year and

36
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,130
then the second one being being a

37
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:36,070
student at the Sands Technology

38
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,070
Institute and I'll mention why back

39
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,460
into the details a few things to talk

40
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,440
about when I'm talking about you know

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,860
security awareness training you kind of

42
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,860
hear that

43
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,210
Airness you know what I'm talking

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,710
through things here

45
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,710
really focusing on

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,990
on a Lincoln efficient email not

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,460
my tea who called you from number you

48
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,580
haven't seen before and is asking for

49
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,580
you

50
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:13,210
when we're talking about training

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,120
teaching new skills a lot of times the

52
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,120
intents for this to be really specific

53
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,349
and accounts payable are being trained

54
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:32,040
vo impersonation emails or even folks in

55
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,040
IT are being trained

56
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,670
is that person on the other end of the

57
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,390
line so just a quick clarification there

58
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,899
so one of the things that we see a lot

59
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:51,970
in these organizations in something that

60
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:55,030
here was an sands management 433 that's

61
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:58,239
all about in maintaining and monitoring

62
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,650
a security awareness program is that a

63
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,950
lot of times we see these security

64
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:08,950
awareness programs being run just by a

65
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,540
quick heads up your bike seems going in

66
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,679
and out so just make sure the placement

67
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,679
stays getting close okay

68
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,030
actually I think that somehow made it

69
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,570
worse

70
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,300
now there is now I will not move okay

71
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,180
well it's working just fine all right

72
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,470
did we we catch I guess the importance

73
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,470
here of awareness and training

74
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:39,100
oh you guys can read that uh huh so what

75
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:42,070
I wanted to cover here is the fact that

76
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,900
not only this is covered in that full

77
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,079
course but something that I see a lot is

78
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,580
either human resources or the compliance

79
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,280
department

80
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,610
are charged with implementing these

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,890
security programs but they're not the

82
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,690
security experts so a lot of times what

83
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,720
we end up seeing is something that's

84
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,859
really driven by whatever compliance

85
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,440
requirements

86
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,000
organization has to follow so more often

87
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,280
than not it's going to be once a year

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,820
it's going to cover really the bare

89
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,890
minimum requirements that you know it is

90
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,849
outlined in whatever law or regulation

91
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,349
is there and it's really going to be

92
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,600
cookie cutter across the organization

93
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,940
when I talk to these folks a lot of

94
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,870
times we'll hear IT or information

95
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,480
security is too busy right there they're

96
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,950
focusing on chasing down all these

97
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,260
alerts they're getting from different

98
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,810
malware pop-ups or phishing attacks

99
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,070
coming in they don't necessarily have

100
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,070
the time to focus on

101
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,560
I like the chicken or the egg scenario

102
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,698
they're constantly chasing the chicken

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,699
around without actually

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,720
get involved

105
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:01,919
that program beyond me

106
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,110
often times of IT and is folks that

107
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,330
aren't even sure what's being covered

108
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,780
they've been beers they don't really

109
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:12,090
remember farming process and they think

110
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,330
HR is doing something but they're really

111
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,659
not sure and like I said ITR is is too

112
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,969
busy chasing those alerts where they

113
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,709
can't actually

114
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:24,929
I have to do and I know the the numbers

115
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:27,899
here aren't great I guess that's an

116
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:30,378
issue with surveys in itself but I

117
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,379
wanted to

118
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,620
folks around what they're seeing as far

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,620
as

120
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,990
and you know we're still seeing a really

121
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:44,889
big majority driven by annual programs

122
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,349
that are be recorded online function

123
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,630
there is that it's very vanilla generic

124
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:51,639
programming that's given to every

125
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,400
employee and chances are probably

126
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,229
something that's a few years old what

127
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,560
was actually nice here some of the other

128
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:01,630
questions is a handful of folks that

129
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,380
responded actually noted that their

130
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,630
training focuses on home devices which

131
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,110
is something I'm going John and that

132
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,999
there actually is a really involved

133
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,960
process for tracking

134
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:19,440
updated

135
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,330
and the last one it actually was kind of

136
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,569
surprising results here that folks are

137
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,568
all

138
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:31,730
get it for it just a heads up you're

139
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:35,560
going in out again

140
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,560
now we're pretty out

141
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,810
yep still not back just barely hear you

142
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:44,179
but baby

143
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,060
yep Hertz

144
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,400
button guy do this is this any better

145
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,790
that's better okay

146
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,448
to headset there we go so one of the

147
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:04,270
items here when we saw IT and is was

148
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:08,380
actually involved in the development

149
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,630
process is the curse of knowledge a big

150
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,139
thing here and it's something you know

151
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:16,090
I've noticed I struggle with as well is

152
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:19,330
making assumptions based on your

153
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:22,630
experience really making assumptions not

154
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,430
only on what the audience will know but

155
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,100
what they're interested in hearing about

156
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,289
and what we you know start to struggle

157
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,840
with and what we really don't like to

158
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:34,510
hear is well the end users are too dumb

159
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,969
so we need to you know make this as

160
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,039
simple as possible you might need to

161
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,840
make things simple for certain folks but

162
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,539
it's not because they're dumb and that's

163
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,250
one of those I guess opinions that can

164
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:48,039
really hurt an organization from a

165
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,710
security training perspective one of the

166
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:53,740
things I like to point out is you know

167
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,210
you may be the the security wizard what

168
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,430
are the chances you're able to balance

169
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,840
the books at the end of the quarter with

170
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,669
all sorts of different stock option

171
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,638
requirements of everything you know

172
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,799
these end users are really good at their

173
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,500
own jobs they just may not have the

174
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,440
security understanding you have and when

175
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,520
we start to see a farm behavior model we

176
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,159
start to see that as your ability

177
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,919
increases and certain things the

178
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:24,430
motivation will start to drop and what I

179
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:27,448
mean by that is it can start to skew

180
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:30,520
your opinion on really what's important

181
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:32,589
one of the examples you know I had here

182
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,348
that based on I guess current events

183
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:38,409
with the Cova 19 items is risk

184
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:40,390
estimation as far as travel I think a

185
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,130
lot of folks have you know heard of that

186
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,949
comparison between flying and driving

187
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,920
before but when you start to look at the

188
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:51,490
numbers you know driving is

189
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,709
significantly more dangerous but if you

190
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,220
don't really understand all the things

191
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:59,199
that go into air travel those risks can

192
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,430
look you know really intimidating and

193
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,680
that may be something you want to try

194
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,140
and avoid the other area where we start

195
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,910
to see itn is folks start to miss the

196
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,270
mark is focusing on the wrong thing

197
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:14,089
so starting to update training and maybe

198
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:17,270
push out really frequent notices to your

199
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:19,520
end users based on earn events in the

200
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,840
news and this one can be really tough

201
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,300
and is really dependent on the

202
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,490
organization because what you don't want

203
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,550
to do is get to the point of alert

204
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,960
fatigue of those end users especially if

205
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,390
you're starting to bombard them with

206
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,170
things that are not relevant to them

207
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:38,600
what I mean here is if you're providing

208
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,339
information as an informational and of

209
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,290
take-home thing for the employees and

210
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,650
it's something that they're likely to

211
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,719
face either in their day jobs or at home

212
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,760
that can be really beneficial because

213
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,010
we'll talk about how that can carry over

214
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,840
to protecting corporate environment but

215
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:58,069
if you're constantly bombarding say the

216
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,860
marketing department or the sales

217
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:04,250
department with the latest you know

218
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,080
technical jargon of the most recent apt

219
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,210
attack they're going to start to tune

220
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,400
you out and then all of a sudden what

221
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,190
looks like a really solid and well

222
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,130
informed program for my tea is again

223
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,440
missing the mark with those end users

224
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,960
one of the great quotes that I saw here

225
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,320
is never letting a breach go to waste

226
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,970
and what I mean by that is if you are

227
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,550
involved with building out your program

228
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,880
there is a certain amount of time after

229
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,979
any big organization is in the news with

230
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,800
any sort of breach or security incident

231
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,410
where folks are paying attention and

232
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,209
executives are likely thinking could

233
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,520
that be us are we doing the right things

234
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,760
to actually stop this from happening and

235
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,890
so one of the things you want to do is

236
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,680
take advantage of that increased

237
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,180
awareness at the executive level and

238
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,390
actually start to work towards getting

239
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,099
an executive by it and what we want to

240
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,189
see there as far as something that's

241
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,030
going to have success long term is

242
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,760
probably not what ever wants the years

243
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,740
have a project plan in place the big

244
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,650
thing and was actually just touched on a

245
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,860
few moments ago is executives love

246
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:15,620
seeing different graphs and measurements

247
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,190
so build out a process where you can

248
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,640
actually identify will do X and if we

249
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,620
see Y that means

250
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,010
it's working and be able to show some

251
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,980
tangible improvement along the way also

252
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:33,480
don't go straight for the cash a lot of

253
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,950
people would love to rush to saying hey

254
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,860
that's great there's this attack we

255
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,960
don't want to be the next news story we

256
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,490
need six hundred thousand dollars for

257
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,070
this new tool to prevent it from

258
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,780
happening that might be the case but you

259
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,480
also might be able to leverage existing

260
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,069
tools you know open-source tools you

261
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,150
know there may be other ways without a

262
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:56,160
massive price tag and maybe that

263
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,110
expensive tool is what you need but that

264
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,180
might be further down the line if you

265
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,100
can make incremental improvements along

266
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,560
the way you can start to get that buy-in

267
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,060
and have them understand exactly what

268
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,609
you're doing and where you do need to

269
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:12,180
bring in that extra tool start and small

270
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:15,240
you know you don't need to solve your

271
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:18,209
entire organizations problem in one day

272
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,790
it doesn't need to be one project to fix

273
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:23,820
everything really sticking with the

274
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,980
theme of being able to show what you're

275
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,820
doing is making a positive impact for

276
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,410
the organization and building up that

277
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,720
internal trust and internal credibility

278
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,630
that the ideas you're putting forward

279
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,910
are for the good of the organization and

280
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,370
are what you're you know ultimately

281
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,990
working towards is getting a more secure

282
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,360
environment now this next one

283
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:48,000
totally dependent on the organization I

284
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,130
realized but it happens enough that I

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,080
want to mention it is you may have to

286
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,520
ditch the hoodie there are certain

287
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,680
organizations and I think it's becoming

288
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,590
more and more popular where dress code

289
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,609
is less important a lot of the

290
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,260
organization's I work with are in the

291
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,630
financial services industry and the

292
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,760
health care industry and the people that

293
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,000
are signing those checks or approving

294
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,830
the big products products and projects

295
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,740
don't necessarily understand or maybe

296
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:16,410
don't want to understand the typical IT

297
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,000
or hacker culture and here you have to

298
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,730
use some of those social engineering

299
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,010
skills we use against end users against

300
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,840
the executives trying to dress the part

301
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,330
fit in with them start to build the

302
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,940
rapport with the executives that you

303
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,220
need to actually win over to your side

304
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,170
to get these projects up and running a

305
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,840
few books here you know there

306
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,790
a lot of really good books and studies

307
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,410
and everything around working with other

308
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,420
people and getting some of this buy-in

309
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,050
these four I did want to call out and

310
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,189
they really do help you understand

311
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,859
putting yourself in the other person's

312
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,500
shoes so whoever the recipient of

313
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,020
training or security control you're

314
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,080
trying to address all four of these

315
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:01,860
books touch on different areas to help

316
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,260
you again train avoid that ignorance of

317
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,200
knowledge and understand what the end

318
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:10,140
user is seeing without your security

319
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,360
Wizards skill set at the same time you

320
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,819
need to take the time to understand the

321
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,270
business without understanding why the

322
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,980
end user is doing certain things that's

323
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:23,100
going to contribute to you missing the

324
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,970
mark on that training initiative common

325
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:30,560
examples we see is ITR is wants to you

326
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,550
know block all sorts of removable media

327
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,069
probably with good reason there's a lot

328
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,349
of different malicious attacks but

329
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,960
especially in the industries and I work

330
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:44,100
in there are some folks that actually

331
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,050
require different USBs or file transfer

332
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,330
web apps all sorts of different things

333
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,829
that they actually need to do their job

334
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,050
and if you're trying to block that

335
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,690
they're going to find a way to really

336
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:57,359
get their job done and likely circumvent

337
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:01,260
some of your controls some other things

338
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,810
that we see is secure email portals can

339
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,030
be miserable to work with on the

340
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,949
receiving end I'm not sure how many

341
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,260
different portals folks tend to work

342
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,420
with but if you're trying to log in to

343
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,210
really any of them I'm cast proof point

344
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,030
six any of the big ones there it's a

345
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:20,490
really clunky experience and if the

346
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,990
sales team is being forced to encrypt

347
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,330
every email that goes out with

348
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,100
attachments regardless of the

349
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,690
sensitivity of the content in those

350
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,010
attachments they're going to start

351
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,410
finding a way to work around that

352
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,319
because now they may be losing sales

353
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,839
based on a poor user experience on that

354
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,300
so really make sure you're able to focus

355
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,860
on what these folks have to do to get

356
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,930
their job done

357
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,840
and then really make sure that you're

358
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:48,270
able to get them to understand why

359
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,160
security is important now we used to

360
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,750
hear PI T or security being the

361
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,569
Department of know you really want to

362
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,390
change that opinion in your organization

363
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,610
get them to understand why you are

364
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,590
pushing certain initiatives while you

365
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,600
also want to understand what they're

366
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,880
doing in their day job and figure out

367
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,860
how you can work together another post

368
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,980
that went up that I do want to highlight

369
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,250
from Lance is he just had an awesome

370
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,020
talk and post on building out security

371
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,879
culture so there's a great reading class

372
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:22,119
for you here as well

373
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:25,839
the last thing I wanted to highlight is

374
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:28,149
we've seen a lot of success in tailoring

375
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,639
some security programs to individual

376
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:33,699
benefits meaning how can you teach that

377
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,369
end user how to protect themselves their

378
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:38,289
kids their family members at home you

379
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:40,569
know more and more we're seeing elderly

380
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,579
relatives have issues with whether it's

381
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:45,099
the IRS scam or social media account

382
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:47,378
being taken over having things like a

383
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,449
Lunch and Learn program a personal

384
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:51,549
device review or checklist things like

385
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:53,829
that you know there's considerations as

386
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:55,419
far as liability you don't want to be

387
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,549
getting caught up with that but if

388
00:16:55,419 --> 00:17:00,399
you're teaching people how to actually

389
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,539
protect their family members they're

390
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,100
gonna pay attention a little more

391
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:06,339
because that hits closer to home work

392
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,289
may just be work to that person but if

393
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,329
you're teaching them how they can keep

394
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:12,849
their you know 80 something-year-old

395
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,859
grandmother from being scammed by an IRS

396
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:19,029
scam again they're gonna pay attention

397
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:20,678
and those behaviors or the training on

398
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:22,539
how to spot those sorts of things are

399
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,339
going to become part of their day-to-day

400
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:27,158
have it and they're actually going to be

401
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,860
able to start protecting the corporate

402
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:31,330
information without necessarily

403
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,279
realizing the last bit here is just

404
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,720
making sure security awareness you know

405
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,539
we need to move away from that being an

406
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,970
HR or appliance function we really do

407
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:42,240
need to get all of this through due to

408
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,919
an organizational wide understanding

409
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,779
we've seen a lot of great success when

410
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,629
really departments have fun with this

411
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:51,789
you can have competitions between

412
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:54,189
departments as far as hey we had a

413
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:57,039
hundred percent of the accounting folks

414
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,360
report the last phishing email so we're

415
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,730
going to give them a shout-out to the

416
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,309
whole company and really start to drive

417
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,929
some of that internal friendly

418
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,700
competition in getting that buy-in when

419
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,279
someone has the opportunity to

420
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,169
contribute to the material they're more

421
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,080
likely to pay attention to put the

422
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:15,639
effort in very last thing Walla sheep I

423
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,000
don't know how many folks are familiar

424
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:21,519
with that it really is entertaining but

425
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,070
may not be the best thing to do in your

426
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:27,519
corporate environment may be fun for IT

427
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,289
a lot of folks do not enjoy being called

428
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,929
out in a negative light and what I like

429
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:34,840
to actually do is flip this around and

430
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:36,940
get back to that wall of fame mentality

431
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,428
where you actually are highlighting

432
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,590
folks that are reporting phishing emails

433
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:43,389
are reporting suspicious people and are

434
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,029
actually doing all the things we want to

435
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:47,949
see people like getting congratulated to

436
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:49,269
do that really highlight the successes

437
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,379
and you'll start to see those numbers

438
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:55,330
freeze so the last few things if you

439
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:57,070
take nothing else away any of your

440
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,399
pitches and trainings keep them short

441
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,950
and non-technical keep that focused on

442
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:05,918
really the the key things folks need for

443
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,240
their job while being secure make sure

444
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,730
you're providing those updates to

445
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,470
leadership they do like seeing drafts in

446
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,600
different graphics on where things are

447
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,980
getting better play the long game you

448
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,379
don't need to fix everything at once

449
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:21,070
make sure you can address small wins

450
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:23,019
with that slides and links it to a bunch

451
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,059
of different things I'm included there

452
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:27,909
if you don't want to scan the QR codes I

453
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:31,658
will also post the link into the slides

454
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:33,360
chat fantastic thank you so much and by

455
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:37,059
the way I've got a little bit of

456
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,039
presentation tip tips for you I want you

457
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,168
to take that headset that you were using

458
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,869
and just yet wrote against the wall as

459
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:46,799
hard as you possibly can and never you

460
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,799
nothing again
