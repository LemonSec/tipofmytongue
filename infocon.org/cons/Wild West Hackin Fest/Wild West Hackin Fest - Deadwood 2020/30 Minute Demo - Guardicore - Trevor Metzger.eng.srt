1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,569
all right next up I believe we have

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:11,259
Garda Corps who do we have from them we

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,719
have Trevor Anya yes I'm here hey Trevor

4
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:15,249
a little bit about Garda Corps and why I

5
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:17,320
think it's super cool that you guys are

6
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:19,330
here once again thank you for jumping

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,460
onboard and sponsoring this insane

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,589
virtual conference and kind of rolling

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,449
with the punches but if you go back and

10
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,769
you look at Black Hills Information

11
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:28,960
Security and a lot of the work that

12
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:30,999
we've done over the past couple of years

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,920
there has been a tremendous amount of

14
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:36,190
research at bhi us and attacking cloud

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:39,399
platforms and I really believe that most

16
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:41,949
organizations jumped into cloud well

17
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,590
before they were ready and by they I

18
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:46,089
mean the actual cloud infrastructures

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,219
having the security around it that we

20
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,660
need it's basically like hey let's take

21
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,039
all of our most sensitive assets and

22
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,648
just throw that crap up in the cloud and

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,120
see what happens and you got people with

24
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,260
multi-tenant they've got you know

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,699
running things in a juror they're

26
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,370
running things in Google cloud compute

27
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:02,050
running things in AWS and without really

28
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,579
thinking about how you can tie that all

29
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,070
together from security perspective to

30
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,479
stop pentesting firms like us and the

31
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,639
attackers that are out there all the

32
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:13,810
time so with that sir are you ready to

33
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,270
go I am alright so my handing it over to

34
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,150
you so take it and run thank you for the

35
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,750
intro and welcome everybody to my home

36
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,689
office

37
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,780
I'm with Garda core fury engineer about

38
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:28,689
here located in Golden Colorado Garda

39
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,020
core is the Tel Aviv company we're based

40
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:36,059
in Israel been around since about 2013

41
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,350
our primary focus is visibility

42
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,020
segmentation reach detection and

43
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,969
incident response so I'm gonna go over a

44
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,979
little bit today about you're pretty

45
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:47,500
much in that order

46
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,810
segmentation everybody knows it's pretty

47
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,740
much the oldest concept in security the

48
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,780
best way to reduce your risk and to

49
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,640
create a better security posture still a

50
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,979
lot of the folks that we talk to and

51
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,280
that we speak to out there in the wild

52
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:05,380
wild west they don't or aren't

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,288
segmenting their networks

54
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,478
and I could vouch for this you know my

55
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:12,640
previous experience was I was a network

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,900
engineer security engineer you know

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,790
really being out there in the trenches

58
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,180
and doing this with those traditional

59
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,519
and some firewalls and you know not only

60
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,620
is it difficult but once you're done

61
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,800
using those tools you get very little

62
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,880
protection in very little visibility in

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,650
that east-west track and with those

64
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,349
traditional segmentation those projects

65
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,950
and planning and coordination is very

66
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,590
complex

67
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,910
we've got multiple teams involved SEC

68
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:45,670
ops net SEC network infrastructure and

69
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,349
course your server platform teams all of

70
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,819
those guys need to be coordinated and

71
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:51,220
they need to play nicely together

72
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,869
once you toss in those distributed data

73
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,930
centers and the multi cloud scenarios

74
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,510
this becomes a very difficult task for

75
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,459
all of those teams who are generally

76
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,578
really busy doing all kinds of other

77
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:06,340
important stuff and then the actual act

78
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:08,650
of moving those applications of servers

79
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,709
between VLANs it requires changes in

80
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,510
downtime and it's high risk and we all

81
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,630
know that that means a really crappy

82
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,640
weekend or everybody involved

83
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,010
summarising here in this tweet may seem

84
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,010
like a joke but it is it's funny but

85
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,170
it's true and this is exactly what we

86
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,910
hear and we see out there in the Wild

87
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,059
West

88
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:33,489
so you know having that black and who

89
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,889
are flattish network it's just really

90
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,290
not an option anymore most of the

91
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:41,019
traffic you have in your data centers

92
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,850
all that east-west and those perimeters

93
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:47,829
are getting harder and harder to define

94
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:50,608
and so you need to take those measures

95
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:53,230
to reduce the risk lateral movement and

96
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:56,079
we reduce the impact of those breaches

97
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,179
and and of course everybody's really

98
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,269
high on those words of the zero trust

99
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,000
architecture and that makes a good high

100
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,639
on our priority list business impact of

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,160
segmentation this is how we are able to

102
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,700
do this and benefit your your business

103
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,238
so first those lateral movements we all

104
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,519
know breaches happen so you can segment

105
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,448
and you can significantly reduce your

106
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,430
tax

107
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:23,259
minimize all the potential for your

108
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,949
lateral movements in case of an actual

109
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:29,169
break reach and from our experience more

110
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,819
than 90 percent of those open ports that

111
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,409
you have within your network and within

112
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:35,020
your systems are not needed

113
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:37,780
rath application operation and they just

114
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,810
introduce risk second we can Purdue

115
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,818
protect your digital crown jewels being

116
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,550
able to effectively ring fast you get

117
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,810
your digital crown jewels across any

118
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,379
infrastructure that you guys may have

119
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,509
that basically it keeps those breaches

120
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:55,599
from less critical assets coming into

121
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:57,310
those more high-value assets and

122
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,319
protects those high-value assets from

123
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,849
one another so it's one of the most

124
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,939
common use cases that we needed to see

125
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:06,400
out there and then that dirty word of

126
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:09,430
compliance it's the one use case where

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,159
you can't overlook segmentation without

128
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,669
actual financial consequences so thus

129
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:17,199
you you need it so in many cases

130
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,810
regulations require segments to be as

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,789
small as a single application for equal

132
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,560
parts of your network and your business

133
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:27,159
that's when we get to hear your micro

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,770
segmentation or nano segmentation really

135
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:31,599
get down to a granular level fourth on

136
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,299
the list here is cloud your

137
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:36,310
organization's adopt cloud and your

138
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,500
applications become hybrid this

139
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,779
introduces an additional tax surface and

140
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,430
also additional types of infrastructure

141
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:44,650
with its own controls and then at the

142
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:48,099
very end there we need to make sure that

143
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,289
security allows for innovation and as

144
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:52,150
business strive to innovate securely

145
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:55,449
they require access controls to be

146
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,789
placed as applications are landed and of

147
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:00,490
course the security cannot impact that

148
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:03,068
expiration so how does guard a quarter

149
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,810
do this we address these challenges by

150
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,279
deploying an agent on all your servers

151
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,379
all your workloads in the environment

152
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:11,199
infrastructure agnostic bare metal

153
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:13,509
virtual eyes of a cloud containerized

154
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,789
environments ultimately because we are

155
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:18,039
an agent or on the server list

156
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:19,810
perspective we have time I can show you

157
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,000
guys actually what our service is going

158
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,550
to be looking like we are able to

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,469
maintain all of the composure and those

160
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,050
policies within each and every one of

161
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,389
these environments

162
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,979
and then the way we address this we're

163
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,800
using that attack service and mitigating

164
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,180
risk is we visualize those close between

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
your systems or your environment so that

166
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,930
you actually know what you have and then

167
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,520
what you know what you have we can

168
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,230
implement the security across all those

169
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,289
environments

170
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,630
oh and here's a little blurb on whom you

171
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,470
protect we got some big financial

172
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:55,140
services healthcare manufacturing retail

173
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:57,720
transport and logistics telecom and push

174
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,599
your online search we also those folks

175
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,510
here really interested in is our garden

176
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:08,550
collapse so Guard Corps laughs these are

177
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:11,490
our Israeli aking team that we have in

178
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,370
tel-aviv they've created a tool called

179
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,340
infection monkey this is free super-easy

180
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,410
open source what this essentially does

181
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,750
is you release it within your

182
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,910
environment and it does an assessment

183
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,920
with your segmentation it was out it

184
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,260
starts attacking propagating throughout

185
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,210
your network really fun to see and then

186
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:35,130
we give you a nice little list out and a

187
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:37,500
little report on how exposed you are and

188
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:43,159
then what infection monkey shows you and

189
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:47,250
our Sentra will then mix so with that

190
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,940
jump into the actual demo today here we

191
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:54,689
go

192
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:57,919
okay so here is what we have got etc

193
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:57,919
a little bit undercover

194
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:07,310
are

195
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,310
tastes and so what this really looks

196
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,930
like is we can

197
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,880
like an ancient on each one of these

198
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,510
systems it is a proprietary kernel

199
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,850
driver that we add and you work in two

200
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,890
different spaces from the user space in

201
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,980
the kernel space and the user space

202
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:27,169
really it's just the reporting kernel

203
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,540
space itself is where we do the actual

204
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:32,720
enforcement policy enforcement and

205
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,909
because we're on an agent we're not you

206
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,410
know in its proprietary entirely from

207
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,490
guard of course perspective we're not

208
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,199
using firewalls

209
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,909
we've native firewalls like your windows

210
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,780
firewall or not these might be tables

211
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:48,199
played proprietary driver and this

212
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:50,540
allows us then to launch down into the

213
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,940
system itself and be able to see the

214
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,500
actual sort of the actual processes that

215
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,320
are communicating so we can see here

216
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,080
like Tomcats communicating to let's

217
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,440
check this database server on the other

218
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,440
side

219
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:09,069
those we got tomcat community d'mongo d

220
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,480
and then that allows us as a proprietary

221
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:13,969
driver to be able to implement these

222
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,660
policies all the way up to that specific

223
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:21,139
process okay and then get rid of these

224
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,140
controls for my sharing like this open

225
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,420
we can actually see

226
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,730
[Music]

227
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,680
what these processes are doing here we

228
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,180
go we got the Java process for Tomcat

229
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,849
and we see what the path and it's

230
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,030
running from the actual hash involved

231
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:37,650
and you can see the command line that

232
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:40,199
instantiated that process

233
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,600
but then you know this looks as ugly as

234
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:47,520
it does what we do is that we're going

235
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:52,830
to group up all these systems so

236
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:55,230
one of those agents has a it's a key

237
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,330
value store and each one of those key

238
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,520
value stores basically allows us to tag

239
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,670
or we call grouping all these systems

240
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:05,970
together so then you can see all your

241
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:09,780
systems as you want and then from

242
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:12,050
anywhere within these roofs I care let's

243
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,910
go into production

244
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,760
you see all the applications running

245
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,829
here within production okay say then you

246
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,930
can look to see what their dependencies

247
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:26,000
are and we could actually dive down deep

248
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,589
into app billing and we could see all

249
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,899
the different roles that make up our

250
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,700
billing application you can see all the

251
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:36,640
communications between the different

252
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,640
roles again we could blast down

253
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,930
I hit the wrong button now we could

254
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,810
blast down into the actual a database

255
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,660
role see all the systems that are

256
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,459
running and then go deep dive into the

257
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,709
actual processes that are running within

258
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:54,550
the system see here's again at MongoDB

259
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,480
[Music]

260
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,089
anywhere that we see bit

261
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,959
go ahead and filter by this gun we could

262
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,959
get rid of everything else

263
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:10,030
and so then we could say alright let's

264
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:14,010
go ahead and create a policy and now

265
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:18,019
we're going to maintain policy based on

266
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,950
oops here we go asthma bit easier

267
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:22,320
reduction

268
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:26,070
roll load balancers and database servers

269
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,970
at web servers and then what we could do

270
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:33,480
is create two types of app segmentation

271
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,340
or in micro segmentation policy okay so

272
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,610
I'll start a soft real quick on the app

273
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,610
segmentation

274
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:44,900
he's right click we say used from this

275
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:46,250
disability map we can create a ring

276
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,689
fence for the an actual application

277
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:52,970
itself so just concentrating on billing

278
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,050
we automatically create these rules for

279
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,950
you that says Billy

280
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:59,959
and talk to Billy and everything inside

281
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,670
of this ring-fence we really don't care

282
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,030
at this point in time yeah right because

283
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,829
we're doing this high level so we those

284
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,329
get marked as green to eight you know

285
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,880
our load balancers talking to web

286
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,250
servers and the web server talk database

287
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,650
server

288
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,660
that's hitting on this allow rule and

289
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,520
then we have this other auto rule here

290
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,959
for alert anybody talking to billing

291
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,270
we're gonna go ahead and alert on that

292
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,370
yeah we're not gonna block it to get so

293
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,290
here's a communication coming from R

294
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,870
infrastructure and he's hitting on that

295
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,760
rule so it gets marked as read so we do

296
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,930
a little bit of a deeper dive and see

297
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,780
what in the infrastructure is

298
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,579
communicating okay cool it's my jump box

299
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,439
I want to go ahead and allow that you

300
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,440
just right-click add allow rule

301
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,370
then that creates that rule from a

302
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,500
specific label as there are grooves

303
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,420
they're going to from jump box

304
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,360
long-drawn load balancers and it's

305
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,880
grabbing that specific process there

306
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,440
that layer seven process on your source

307
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,630
and layer seven process on your

308
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,840
destination so we got the W get process

309
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,610
communicating the nginx

310
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,860
and so then we're looking around and

311
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,710
everything else looks good okay cool

312
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,540
now we could feel into this and go ahead

313
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,040
and say you know let this soak in for

314
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,920
like say a week make sure we didn't miss

315
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,880
anything maybe longer if this is maybe

316
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,920
an application that is dependent on say

317
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,900
more time based business processes like

318
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,550
over your quarters or end-of-year or

319
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,100
something like that so that'll be just

320
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,870
right click the mouse over and we can

321
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,970
shoot that from alert down and blocking

322
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,410
and now we have an application ring

323
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:37,379
that's hard policy

324
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:39,209
next step I'm sorry I usually when these

325
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:40,949
do that was ours I'd like to have a

326
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:43,670
little bit of interaction but I'm having

327
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:45,019
to blow through this a little fast

328
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,649
next step we're going to do a little

329
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:50,570
micro segmentation and so what that does

330
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,339
is that took that billing the billing

331
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,920
rule that we didn't really care at that

332
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:57,709
previous stage now we do care so we're

333
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,180
gonna move that into alerting that now

334
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,069
is alerting so all this communication

335
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,050
that's hitting on that rule turns red

336
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,510
and then same deal

337
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,229
Oh through hair right click on all the

338
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,230
communications

339
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,050
at allowable and then everything gets

340
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,690
created then again from process to

341
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,540
process and then with your traditional

342
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:26,649
destination ports and then tada we are

343
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:28,240
now micro segmentation you're going to

344
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:30,399
miss it so the alert will tell you and

345
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,370
then we're gonna say let's move that

346
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,930
into block stage and then air now we're

347
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:41,240
in fest and we're micro segmented and

348
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:43,910
we're in a hard ball see cool

349
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,350
with that let me just dive a little bit

350
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,610
more into these labels because the

351
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,610
labels are really

352
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,010
really important to understand and it

353
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,580
also shows you the flexibility of our

354
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,580
solution

355
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,229
one of these servers again

356
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,210
[Music]

357
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,540
so here's my billing it's looking at

358
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,540
billing

359
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,189
highlighting on this web - server we can

360
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,740
see in the lower officer just open that

361
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,660
up look at the processes in the lower

362
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,610
right hand corner we can see all the

363
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,350
labels that are applied and again these

364
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,540
are the key value stores so there's many

365
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,180
ways that we can actually create these

366
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:26,510
labels we can ingest them through other

367
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:29,390
systems if you have a CMDB or some type

368
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,880
of a trusted source service now could be

369
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,399
a spreadsheet maybe any way that we

370
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,529
maintain and manage some semblance of

371
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,600
your environment if you don't have that

372
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:41,149
and of course dr. core can view that

373
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,270
that place of trust all right so we're

374
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:46,670
we can pull in build these based on API

375
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:50,089
there's a really simple way that we

376
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:52,640
could do it just visually to the UI we

377
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:55,750
could create labels say let's just

378
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,750
create a label called

379
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,709
conference

380
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,709
ha

381
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,359
and we could do this based on some

382
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,549
criteria

383
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,410
either naming convention or IP address

384
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:17,809
so for naming conventions we could do

385
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,839
you know starts with contains this is if

386
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:22,429
your environment has a fairly co-parents

387
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,699
naming convention that you guys are

388
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:29,569
following okay if you don't do it based

389
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:31,488
on IP addresses this states then here

390
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:33,139
I'm going to delete this this create

391
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:35,660
something to this effect like here

392
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:37,129
here's a application accounting create

393
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,929
all these you know this is based on

394
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:42,290
naming convention then you it matches

395
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:45,640
your assets and we also have the ability

396
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,899
to do this from

397
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,899
individual perspective

398
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,009
but here on their clear Alma filters

399
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,050
we can see all of our different

400
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,320
environments I'm going to ungroup these

401
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,319
guys

402
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,559
so you can see all our different assets

403
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,939
of all of our different workloads and

404
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,160
let's just grab a couple of these guys

405
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:12,459
over here so I'm just gonna grab these

406
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,970
randomly and down here I'm gonna grab my

407
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,610
hand

408
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,290
it's my little draggy hand and at this

409
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:19,869
point I could just from a batch

410
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:22,060
perspective and say here let's do my

411
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:24,079
conference

412
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,249
and

413
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,249
well said asked

414
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:37,460
and so then we real of then we could

415
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,499
they will pretty much on the go as you

416
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,559
see fit this this really allows you then

417
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:41,559
to

418
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,220
actualize your environment to any

419
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:50,100
particular needs that you have

420
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,020
we just created this conference i evens

421
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:56,070
misspelled it so there you go that you

422
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,990
know that it was done on the fly

423
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,620
here's all those systems that I just

424
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:04,190
dragged into my

425
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:07,840
Wild West happened fest conference so

426
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,840
why do we want to do this

427
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:15,389
for multiple use cases because we are

428
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:17,249
just a key-value store you can create

429
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:20,840
any type of labeling and view your

430
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:24,629
systems as you need to on-the-fly

431
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:27,059
scheduled basically it's a report its

432
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:28,799
report from a forensics perspective now

433
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,570
I want to be able to see what happened

434
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,139
last Tuesday for these particular

435
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:36,840
systems I want to be able to let's see

436
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:40,849
group my systems based on let's see here

437
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,849
we got some examples here based on owner

438
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,620
use all the different owners of the

439
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:48,020
particular systems that they have and

440
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,729
inside there we can multi-tier these

441
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,639
labels so that you can see all the

442
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,970
owners applications that they have now

443
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,700
you can do type you can say endpoints

444
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,440
servers new operating systems so you'd

445
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,240
be able to group all your systems

446
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,730
baked-on based on operating systems like

447
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,550
say if you have Windows 2008 Windows

448
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,590
2003 lots of different legacy systems in

449
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:12,139
your writing you could create policy on

450
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,669
on a label so that means you could

451
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,670
create policy based on an operand

452
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:24,959
all right so really what that means is

453
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:27,980
is it's pure flexibility okay

454
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,919
and then what we like to do here is

455
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:34,260
create these maps okay so I'll walk you

456
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,470
through creating a map these maps are

457
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,600
reports it's essentially the time that

458
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,610
we are in your environment through those

459
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,168
agents and we also have an agentless

460
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,629
approach that we have we call them

461
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,039
collect those collectors are essentially

462
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,990
sniffers that are sitting in your

463
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,490
environment where they import mirror

464
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,169
traffic to those collections they're

465
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,529
gathering up the same information at the

466
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:58,110
agents do - we're not seeing of course

467
00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:01,350
up to the process level we're just

468
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:04,639
seeing that layer for communications so

469
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,639
creating these Maps

470
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,230
first we start on a time frame when do

471
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,950
you want to see what happened in your

472
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:18,890
day huh okay this is this again it's a

473
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,990
time machine so we can go back yesterday

474
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,630
last week last 30 days we could do a

475
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,660
custom range let's say let's go back to

476
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:29,090
the 3rd or the 6th of last week maybe

477
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,940
this is before you got that she did some

478
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:33,590
type of a patch maybe an upgrade to a

479
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,200
system maybe there was an incident that

480
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:39,639
happened at that time and we could

481
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,560
filter on exactly what we want to see or

482
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,450
we could exclude we could look at what

483
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,270
we don't want to see right to just

484
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:50,660
remove things is quite important because

485
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:54,590
we can really lock down to exactly what

486
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,780
it is that you're asking ok so we can

487
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,250
look at specific applications that are

488
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,470
running in your environment and now this

489
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,440
is really key because that agent is

490
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:07,370
sitting on your OS we're not doing

491
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,900
application fingerprinting and we first

492
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,060
and foremost we're not doing deep packet

493
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:15,020
inspection into the payloads of your

494
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:17,480
data that would create scaling problems

495
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,340
performance issues so we don't have to

496
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,380
because we're an agent on the system

497
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,080
itself so we're seeing and this list

498
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,360
here is every single application that's

499
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,490
running in the environment ok so we can

500
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,649
look at you know all Java traffic all

501
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,990
ngx we can look at stuff but maybe is

502
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,600
nefarious within your environment like

503
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,120
this attk

504
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:41,560
ok and we can look at assets you know

505
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,350
connections to or from assets

506
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,460
we can look at those labels themselves

507
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,230
so we could go through all these

508
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,140
different labels only want to look at a

509
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,160
specific environment okay you look at

510
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,470
connection types

511
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,750
failed connection times blocks block

512
00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:00,700
that would be like from a third-party

513
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:03,049
tool like say a firewall alright we just

514
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,700
redirected to deception so that's

515
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:07,580
something I think a lot of folks in this

516
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,020
in in this community will be really

517
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,970
interested in and I'll try to get to

518
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,950
that if I have time is our dynamic

519
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,080
deception engine so that's essentially a

520
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,179
honeypot service that we provide every

521
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,059
simple one of those agents as they see

522
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:22,100
traffic leaving their systems or those

523
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:23,889
collectors that they see traffic in the

524
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,918
environment that looks potentially

525
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:29,870
malicious they're going to take that if

526
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,309
that syn packet of that malicious

527
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,239
traffic known potentially malicious

528
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:36,500
traffic we're gonna send those to a

529
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,320
off-site out of your data center

530
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,690
dedicated dynamic deception engine which

531
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,100
is essentially the sidebar then we're

532
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,710
gonna really be able to determine if

533
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,020
that's malicious or not so and we can

534
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,360
look at IP addresses specific policy

535
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,730
policy rules you know you can look to

536
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,699
see if a particular policy Google is how

537
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:58,039
it's affecting your environment so what

538
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,730
I'm gonna do here for R is I'm going to

539
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:04,700
jump back into my building look at just

540
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,679
that specific environment so here's my

541
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,520
app billing and now this is going to be

542
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:13,750
for all environments say production

543
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,269
development that applies to kill him

544
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:21,309
they also include exaction exact

545
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:25,710
connection times because a lot of our

546
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:25,710
competition out there in the market is

547
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,980
ability giving you a map similar this

548
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:35,169
but they're only going to be showing you

549
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,730
samples of what they see in the

550
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,649
environment we're going to show you

551
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:42,060
exactly what's happening in your

552
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:44,550
environment every single connection

553
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:47,280
so we're gonna create this map little

554
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,480
sided note while this is building maps

555
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,240
can be shared

556
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,660
mattes maps can be automatically created

557
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:58,640
here we go so we got ours so like on a

558
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,640
daily instance you can create these maps

559
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,130
and yeah and then we create these maps

560
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,780
there they're essentially your baseline

561
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:10,460
you create these maps so that you can

562
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:13,250
create a report you know like say for

563
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:17,090
compliance and we can say here here's

564
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:19,490
all my systems that are PCI in scope and

565
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:23,000
here's every single communication that

566
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:24,800
they had in this period of time and with

567
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,990
those communications we can say here's

568
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,580
all the rules that were applied to every

569
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,300
single one of those communication so it

570
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:35,120
is literally a proof of your policy as

571
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:38,480
far as compliance is consuming all right

572
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,780
so again here's our map and once we

573
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,230
create these maps and we could go in

574
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,559
[Music]

575
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,559
right

576
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,690
on the correct thing there and we could

577
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,899
go in again and we could further filter

578
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:57,310
down to exactly what we want

579
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,310
we want to stay exclude

580
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,170
ya see action

581
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,160
internet connections something like that

582
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:09,360
I want to exclude all my

583
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,250
to and from the Internet

584
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,510
so then that really concentrates on

585
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,720
what's happening within your environment

586
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,890
itself lots of different ways to exclude

587
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,270
lots of different ways to include

588
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:23,100
policies so

589
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:26,820
that's really it from a visibility

590
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:29,370
perspective then I was able to show you

591
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,399
guys real quick and I apologize for how

592
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:37,110
fast I can through all this but creating

593
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:41,100
rules based on the maps or wealth course

594
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:45,020
we have the ability to create rules in

595
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:49,080
more or less your additional sense well

596
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:54,090
and how am i doing on time you've got

597
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,710
about three minutes I think you guys

598
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,870
would be a little bit more interested

599
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,870
here on let me do the

600
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:07,290
dynamic deception real quick so again

601
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:09,030
these systems agents collectors they're

602
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:13,460
all sitting there looking at this

603
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:15,750
communication and depending on if this

604
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,309
connections are hitting on a specific

605
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,800
algorithm say hey baby these a little

606
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,928
bit sketchy we will wrap that traffic up

607
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,330
and we will send this traffic to a

608
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:27,390
dynamic deception engine what that looks

609
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,159
like is something like this so here's a

610
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,929
here's a user coming from a County web

611
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,210
to going out to particular IP address

612
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:34,710
maybe that IP doesn't exist maybe they

613
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,690
don't they're not running s to Sage

614
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,120
we're seeing that as maybe probing and

615
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,970
so we're saying okay let's let's go

616
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,239
ahead and allow them to log in and then

617
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:48,390
you see the we got a laundry list of

618
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,820
whitelisted passwords we see all their

619
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,830
connection they log in they download a

620
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,870
file they execute that file and then you

621
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:58,620
have a process was thinking backdoor and

622
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:00,928
then they bounced and then we give you

623
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,510
recommended actions so from here from

624
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:05,880
our orchestration we could go ahead and

625
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,440
take snapshots of that virtual system

626
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,410
shut it down basically quarantine it

627
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,610
much like my family is today and then we

628
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:16,530
can block all the traffic all out there

629
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,820
send out a policy rule basically shut

630
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,320
this down anywhere else that's being

631
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,879
sane give you all of this information

632
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,620
that we gather but what we use this

633
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,490
information for is our reputation

634
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,899
analysis so as we're seeing all of this

635
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,340
communications throughout your

636
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,890
environment we're going to give you

637
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,189
reputation scores for IP addresses that

638
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,530
you're communicating with or from and

639
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:42,150
then we also give you reputation on

640
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,000
processes that are running in your

641
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,960
environment or give you reputation for

642
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,530
domains that you're communicating with

643
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,940
so that really looks like we're able to

644
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:55,110
help you from an incident perspective

645
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,000
from a breach perspective no retain that

646
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,189
lateral movements stop that from

647
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,290
happening and then give you scores on

648
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:04,260
reputation what's happening we also have

649
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:06,120
the ability to create rules based on

650
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,620
fully qualified domain names because

651
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,580
we're an agent sitting on the system we

652
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,909
know exactly when you're communicating

653
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,149
with okay what else how am i doing one

654
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,559
time

655
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:17,529
[Music]

656
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:19,779
30 seconds 30 seconds all right so I

657
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:22,570
should probably just wrap it up

658
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:25,210
thanks guys for your time I really wish

659
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,739
this is more or less in person anytime

660
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,389
you guys want to get a little bit deeper

661
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,879
dive see how this works in your

662
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:32,649
environment hit me up My partner and I

663
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:35,049
would love to come out after this whole

664
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:37,178
and I'ma get over to do this in person

665
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:40,330
which is what I really enjoyed with you

666
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:43,859
