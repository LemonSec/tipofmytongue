1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:07,689
what what exactly got you started on

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:10,629
this topic of doing after dumb early it

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,860
was I don't know it was a series of it

4
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:14,379
was one of those things that I get from

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,590
from new people like seriously questions

6
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:20,590
like hey we can I share my screen or my

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,960
yep we got your screen right now do you

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,650
want do you want like ugly like my face

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,630
here no no no they did for whatever

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,689
reason this room GoToWebinar does not

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,879
know why but the webcams are not working

12
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:37,960
in this room oh good okay

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:42,670
I'm not word pantastico camera's not

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:45,880
down there normally so the it was the

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,800
backstory on that was most you can ask

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,020
all the time by new people like I don't

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,750
know if I could do this job I'm not

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:56,410
ready for it and just talking through

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:59,380
just a bunch of just dead simple things

20
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,300
and I saw it's sort of an ironic thing

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,500
it's that I'll kind of talk about a

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,869
little bit more depth but some of the

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,299
more advanced people were missing some

24
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:09,429
simple things that the newer people were

25
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,140
getting and frankly myself included and

26
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:13,960
then taking that step back I was like

27
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,119
man this this is easier than it should

28
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,089
have been but I was just thinking too

29
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,740
high so it is kind of a fun talk and the

30
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,979
Derek and I did a version of this Derek

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,079
Derek Derek banks and at Buck Hills did

32
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,359
a version of this a couple of times we

33
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,949
had a lot of fun with it just just tons

34
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,350
of fun just talking through some really

35
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,319
simple stuff that has kind of a sort of

36
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,699
them unfortunately overlooked sometimes

37
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,679
that can have that you know significant

38
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,390
impact well and it's like I've told you

39
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:42,490
I'm looking back on the years where I

40
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,350
was doing a lot of testing it seemed

41
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,210
like a lot of the stuff that I did was

42
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,068
just like crap would fall out of the sky

43
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,678
and just work for me like oh I'll try

44
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:52,929
this password oh crap that works but no

45
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:54,310
you you have some amazing ones in your

46
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:56,049
previous presentation looking forward to

47
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,670
see the ones that you have here I think

48
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,079
probably one of the best examples I have

49
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,450
I'm gonna pick on jaw for a little bit

50
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,979
when Jafra started pen testing he jumped

51
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,229
right into a test with a very difficult

52
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:06,789
Bank and they put him on a workstation

53
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:09,220
he was trying all kinds of privilege

54
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:10,750
escalation techniques and all kinds of

55
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,150
crazy cool stuff and he was stuck for

56
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,380
about a week and then I'm like well

57
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,130
throughout that week I was like dude

58
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,530
have you checked different

59
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,030
files and file shares kind of before we

60
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,890
had a like share finder and tools like

61
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,790
that and he was like no no no I haven't

62
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,869
done that yeah I'm gonna try this

63
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,030
technique that I read about I'm gonna

64
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,280
try this technique and sure enough like

65
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,540
five minutes looking into a file chair

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,950
there was a share there was like

67
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,510
passwords and it had a bunch of

68
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,760
passwords to servers around the entire

69
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,239
environment it doesn't necessarily have

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,890
to be hard right well in that we if I

71
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,990
frankly that was one of the big pieces

72
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,119
where I had that epiphany we had a test

73
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,370
this we ran in financial institution and

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,200
they were locked down hard I mean it was

75
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,960
absolutely brutal it was one of those

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,660
first sort of apex defenders and we were

77
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,090
getting absolutely nowhere I mean

78
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,859
absolutely it was just it was painful it

79
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,270
wasn't fun and then we started looking

80
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,640
around the file shares and there was

81
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,950
users were setting up file shares all

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,209
over the place and sharing financial

83
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,100
information and this was a financial

84
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,420
institution where you had to have ten

85
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,790
million dollars to come knock on their

86
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,709
door so every single one of those bank

87
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,019
accounts had more zeros than I've ever

88
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,180
seen before and his bad guy you don't

89
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,650
need all of the data right you just need

90
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,840
the one and we sort of forget that

91
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,510
sometimes like we need that DEA we need

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,880
that database and frankly you don't it

93
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,769
doesn't take much to to live in a you

94
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,299
know some of these countries for the

95
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,380
rest of your life frankly for 10 million

96
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,540
dollars you can look at they've done

97
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,820
well in the US for the rest of your life

98
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,260
how's that all these other other

99
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,870
countries where you could you know

100
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,120
pretty darn near buy the entire thing

101
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,400
well I think it's time to shut down the

102
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,870
inside of the hackers studio Q&A session

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,880
and time to kick it over to you for your

104
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,310
presentation so everybody Jimmy Dean was

105
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,880
read siege hacking dumb burly not harder

106
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,920
rigid I have no idea it's funny that

107
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,720
that I have no idea how to pronounce

108
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,619
that I put it in there and I'm like I

109
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,270
don't is that

110
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,550
so I want to say read it'd be like

111
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,360
French but then I sound dumb but I want

112
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,709
to say Redux

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,830
but then I feel like I'm trying to

114
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,470
murder French so I'm glad I'm glad I

115
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,060
took that bullet for you yeah but that

116
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,950
was actually going to actively avoid

117
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,140
using that word so I'm glad you took it

118
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,450
for me so it was yeah thanks thanks for

119
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,000
everybody for effort for coming out

120
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,539
oddly enough I'm actually in San Diego I

121
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,160
can see the former con hotels from from

122
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,229
the window here well the rest of the

123
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,030
family is in San Diego I just want to

124
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,729
walk through some sort of examples here

125
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,460
of

126
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:34,128
it's the simple hacks that you'll see

127
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,878
kind of fun stories related to that as

128
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,710
well

129
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,059
I'm going to keep the questions and

130
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,219
comments I'd like to see if we can keep

131
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:41,719
this kind of interactive if you've got

132
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:45,319
some questions or comments along the way

133
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:47,569
happy to take some of those one of the

134
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:53,779
things that I've learned over my career

135
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:55,610
is it's important to be lazy and IT what

136
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:59,300
which sounds really weird I remember in

137
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,610
eighth grade we had mr. Kaylor and I'm

138
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,740
sure some of you out there are of that

139
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,620
same age remember the printers that had

140
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,389
the the track paper right you can make

141
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,939
the cool banners because it was all

142
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:13,610
together and it had that little stuff on

143
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:16,249
the side I would she make these monster

144
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,370
monster banners right and on this banner

145
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:21,409
he had this the same and forget exactly

146
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,749
what it was what it was but it was

147
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:26,300
something to the effect of the best

148
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:27,649
programmers are the laziest people and I

149
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,689
remember seeing that it's just being

150
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:32,240
shocked said him it always had been told

151
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:35,270
during my my classes you know don't be

152
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,219
lazy work hard and then he literally the

153
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,128
first day I explained it to us like what

154
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:42,589
why why is it important to be lazy Z

155
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:45,740
because the computer is really good at

156
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:49,939
doing the same thing twice don't do that

157
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,740
yourself right so you know try this some

158
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,749
of that that simple stuff person and

159
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,759
sort of an extra on that story I

160
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:58,009
remember my mom came in for tarrant

161
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,860
parent-teacher conference conferences

162
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:03,319
and she would she came home and she was

163
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,259
just livid like I can't believe Kaler is

164
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,149
a Tony who has to be lazy a bubble and I

165
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:10,669
tried to explain to her why that made

166
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:13,639
sense and it was lost on her cell with

167
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:16,998
week we just agreed to what to disagree

168
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,569
but when it comes to hacking it's

169
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:23,389
important to remember do some of the

170
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:26,360
simple stuff first right try dumb and

171
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:29,149
and this is what the real world

172
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,870
bad guys are doing here we always talk

173
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:35,029
about abt right apt is the one that has

174
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,729
breached every single organization

175
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:42,659
because frankly no one wants to admit

176
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:44,520
it's a 16 year old kid in mom's basement

177
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,990
which literally happened this was Apple

178
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,400
right we think Apple we think pretty

179
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,640
good security I know some of you

180
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,390
probably don't but whatever you know big

181
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,969
giant Apple they were breached by a 16

182
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,280
year old kid in Melbourne and when the

183
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,620
police came to the kids house they found

184
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,190
all of the Apple files in a directory on

185
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,470
his dad desktop in a directory called a

186
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,240
hacky hack hack in fact I was I was

187
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,520
wearing my heckie heckie shirt but you

188
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,770
can't see me right now but you don't

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,740
have to be this super advanced attacker

190
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:21,390
and frankly many of the breaches that we

191
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:24,600
see it's not some brand new O'Day that's

192
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,849
the way in it is not some sort of custom

193
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,290
payload that ended up getting them in

194
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,660
it's going to be some sort of

195
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,370
off-the-shelf some sort of vulnerability

196
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,050
that's been around for a while some sort

197
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,120
of technique that's been around for a

198
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,250
long time one of my favorite things to

199
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,550
do is I like listening to the darknet

200
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,100
Diaries super well done a professional

201
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,200
podcast they talk through a number of

202
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,900
times in their just various breeches

203
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,520
it's the same boring sort of stuff over

204
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,679
and over again and then we talked I talk

205
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,510
to clients all the time and they're

206
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,420
trying to set up those overly

207
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:59,789
complicated settings to it it said to

208
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,530
keep the bad guys out but then you ask

209
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,210
about some of the simple things well

210
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,479
yeah well that's that's not important

211
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:09,299
and and it's frankly miss focused

212
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,800
because the the simpler stuff I mean

213
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,690
that's how the bad guys are getting in

214
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,990
right and even if you talk about your

215
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,240
real apt your true nation-state apt

216
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,040
they're not going to bring down there's

217
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,950
you know their brand-new special hammer

218
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,110
until they absolutely have to

219
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,050
you don't lead with that because if you

220
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:31,050
use as an apt the off-the-shelf tools

221
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,240
good luck with attribution right because

222
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,520
if every single bad guy and the face of

223
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,650
the planet has this exact same tool and

224
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,870
you're the apt and you're using it there

225
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,090
is no way they can trace it back to you

226
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,450
know who actually launched this attack

227
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,460
apt is is kind of a lie many ways it's

228
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,190
mostly just the persistence threads and

229
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,130
frankly the persistence often times is

230
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,890
in a way itself a little bit of a lie

231
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,300
let's take a look at an example here

232
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,069
I'm still in this example from my

233
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,800
previous presentation

234
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,260
Equifax right and I'm not trying to beat

235
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,469
up on the people expecto facts but this

236
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,959
is an important case study so with

237
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,560
Equifax it let's walk through some with

238
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:15,930
into the timeline here March 2017 so

239
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,089
almost what three years ago today

240
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,319
earlier this week actually March tenth

241
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,320
is my brother and my brother-in-law's

242
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,450
birthday but the Apache stretch only

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,519
buddy was released right noticed assert

244
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:30,170
everybody gets the patched around that

245
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:33,660
day cool now this is a significant

246
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,069
vulnerability critical risk ideally or

247
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,160
get what organizations are doing is

248
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,579
patching this very quickly what we saw

249
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,459
in this but specific case was in with

250
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:46,709
Equifax we know the date here was March

251
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:50,609
12th this is when the breach happened

252
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:54,089
this is two months two months two months

253
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:57,240
after the the vulnerability is announced

254
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:59,820
now if you think this through we talked

255
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,720
about apt right the advanced persistent

256
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:06,209
threat this is an off-the-shelf pooled

257
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,959
off-the-shelf exploit that has been

258
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:12,239
around for months and this is the way in

259
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,790
right how advanced is it if they're

260
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,310
actually using just you know readily

261
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,550
available tools how persistent are they

262
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:23,430
actually if it took them two months to

263
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,990
do that now of course no organization

264
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,479
that gets breached is gonna come out and

265
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,510
say yeah we were we were breached by

266
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,329
just some thread actor right they want

267
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,720
to say the apt so it sounds worse but

268
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:39,359
realistically that's not often gonna be

269
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,930
the case right when of course they were

270
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,360
inside the network for a for a long time

271
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,430
since between detection and the initial

272
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,550
disclosure was a hundred and forty-one

273
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,229
days so about five months and nearly

274
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,540
three months between when the breach

275
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,120
happened and our detection a key here of

276
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,740
course is we've got to get up somewhere

277
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,140
patchy that's kind of another whole

278
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,390
discussion on developing patches and

279
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,069
identifying vulnerabilities why we

280
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,360
actually wrote a course where we talk

281
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:08,099
through some more of this and the

282
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,510
difficulties sometimes in identifying

283
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,250
these vulnerabilities

284
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:14,760
if you're not readily available on the

285
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,710
surface but the key here is the bad guys

286
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,620
didn't do anything necessarily special

287
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,410
it was off the shelf and it took him

288
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,540
months to what to do it right so

289
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,050
definitely not going to be advanced no

290
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,219
we're uh persistent so this is one of my

291
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,620
favorite wanna this one I got from uh

292
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:35,010
from Derrick banks this one absolutely

293
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,250
cracks me up so he was on a pen test

294
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:42,300
trying to use a net get downloaded Ned

295
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,550
cats and the AV just dinged him right

296
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,760
away no question just BAM it was gone

297
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,969
just glued the file and he was stuck so

298
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,330
so what Derrick did this it's so dumb

299
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,790
it's so brilliant I love it what he did

300
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,670
is he whips you and map now the end map

301
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:04,140
project they have a tool called n cat

302
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:07,020
and cat is like n map but it's got extra

303
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,240
features the beautiful thing is it's

304
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,189
part of a well-known projects right

305
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,410
every one of us knows and map and have

306
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:17,160
probably used n map at some point in

307
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:20,339
time and cat as part of that so he

308
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,990
downloaded n cat and it worked just

309
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,760
great

310
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,290
right there was there was no he had no

311
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,720
point in time did he have to try to

312
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,339
re-encode did he have to try to encrypt

313
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,310
his shellcode did he have to

314
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:35,190
reimplemented some sort of tool and

315
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:38,520
rewriting in c-sharp and then injected

316
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:41,490
him to memory or whatever it was just

317
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,380
using another tool from somebody else

318
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,080
and it worked just fine this is one of

319
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,020
those examples were trying this simple

320
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,210
stuff works and trying it first right

321
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,370
this this how much time we did it's

322
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,590
saved to try this versus doing your own

323
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,570
manual encoding if you've done that

324
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,390
spent time doing that that can be a

325
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,950
tremendous amount of time and you're

326
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,390
really just throwing a bunch of

327
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,340
spaghetti at the wall and hoping

328
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,920
something sticks beautiful beautifully

329
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,540
elegant I love this simple frankly a

330
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,540
little bit dirty a bit of work

331
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,670
absolutely fantastically well right the

332
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,490
other thing that we always see now what

333
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:20,069
I did is I guess today I was just wanted

334
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,840
to check on some more ideas so I wrote a

335
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,130
tweet and I've got a link to the tweet

336
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,440
at the very end because there

337
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,460
hundreds of responses for people that

338
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,730
responded with simple dumb hacks that

339
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:35,130
that happened and it was too many with

340
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,260
the bad passwords and this is one of

341
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,570
those situations where like talking to

342
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,870
clients where they're trying to fix all

343
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,250
these weird edge case security issues

344
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,860
meanwhile everybody in their

345
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,530
organization has these craptastic

346
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:53,280
passwords right I mean we get like

347
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:56,240
winner 2019 and of course the reason is

348
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,800
according to you know what forever ago

349
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,080
Moses came down from a mountain with a

350
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,339
third tablet on the third tab but he

351
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,180
said thou shalt change

352
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,740
nine passwords every 90 days of course

353
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,020
people can't remember their passwords

354
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,700
and they hate calling the helpdesk after

355
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:15,540
a while so they ended up just looking

356
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,850
outside and essentially - deriving their

357
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,270
password from nature right because it

358
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:24,060
outside the weather changes every 90

359
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,010
days I probably snowy where many of you

360
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,260
are and 90 days from now we'll probably

361
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,780
see some flowers and 90 days from now

362
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,180
and nice and hot and sunny and then 90

363
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,100
days later it'll be a the trees are

364
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,680
turning colors so they can literally

365
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,300
look outside and see their password and

366
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,880
of course there's a winter this year in

367
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,339
a winter next year we got capital W

368
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,920
lowercase enter and they need a number

369
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,870
and also they can't repeat the last

370
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,270
seven thousand eight hundred and forty

371
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,520
two passwords so they need another way

372
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:56,370
to differentiate some of those passwords

373
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,350
so they simply do of course bad the ear

374
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,870
and maybe they need a special character

375
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,090
that's gonna be the season then the year

376
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,210
then of course you're probably playing

377
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,280
along at home here the bang right top

378
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,590
left key on the keyboard and there were

379
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,140
so many tweets related to this where

380
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:16,500
people just used these types of

381
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,270
passwords to get in and if you work at

382
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,580
one an organisation I'm sure many of you

383
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,819
are on the blue team ideally you

384
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:27,510
implement a tool to ban these passwords

385
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:30,360
right if you end up telling users not to

386
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:32,550
use these passwords to be honest that's

387
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,339
that's not going to work you can see the

388
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,030
the tweet here from Anders I'm gonna

389
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,550
mess his name up leo

390
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:43,709
et or he says he depended a password

391
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:46,900
spray for an entire company and got 30%

392
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:49,810
so a password spray is you're gonna try

393
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:52,360
a few passwords for everybody in the

394
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,699
organization I was doing this a number

395
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:59,140
of years ago and at one organization

396
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:01,840
they had the it was like fall went into

397
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,449
winter try and fall or winter spring

398
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,550
like fall autumn or winter with the year

399
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:11,200
I think it was I don't know what it was

400
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:13,240
now but we had 16.3% of the people with

401
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,970
that set of that bat password that means

402
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,370
you go to somebody you take a die you'll

403
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,830
roll it you get a six they have that

404
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,720
season in year type of password and then

405
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,360
you see organizations focusing on all

406
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,040
these other much more complicated

407
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,740
security controls when they're missing a

408
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,480
simple one here and when it comes back

409
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,640
to the training right we tell users

410
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,690
don't pick this season in the air but if

411
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,610
you think about it from their

412
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,500
perspective they just want to get their

413
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,240
work done and they don't want to be in

414
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,250
this stupid security meeting just as

415
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,500
much as you don't want to be in the you

416
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,360
know whatever other training it'd be at

417
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,910
your organization that doesn't relate to

418
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,800
your day job so they're sitting there

419
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,150
tired in their seats and they hear this

420
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,160
season in the year and looking at what

421
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,930
this is a great idea I'm gonna do

422
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,459
exactly that and it could be anything

423
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,620
like that doesn't it to be the season in

424
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,540
year if you're gonna ban these passwords

425
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,520
which you should other things that

426
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,709
should be banned it should be your

427
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,030
company name you definitely want to make

428
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,250
sure that the user name and password

429
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,230
don't match those are gonna be some

430
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,420
significant things there but this one

431
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,370
works time and time again this is the

432
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,800
gift that keeps on giving

433
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:20,679
so defenders if even if you can't get

434
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,720
the blocks in place to ban these

435
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,660
passwords I would HIGHLY encourage you

436
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,420
get a process in place where you can

437
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,670
dump you the passwords crack them find

438
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,710
these provided it additional training to

439
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,390
these that these people and then force

440
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,870
them to to what to change their password

441
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:39,670
fun ones are default credentials related

442
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,679
to that obviously I was in one

443
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:44,500
organization and the password was simple

444
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,750
similar to you like orange one and of

445
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,590
course if user change the password what

446
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,080
has become Orange

447
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,870
sometimes default default passwords we

448
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,850
are now priming the pump it might not be

449
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:00,178
one of the normal quote unquote default

450
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,370
passwords or what passwords that leads

451
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,129
we see for example this season in year

452
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,559
but now you're priming the pump and we

453
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:09,658
saw that organization there was Orange -

454
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,779
orange three orange four we went up all

455
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:15,120
the way to 99 and we had I think it was

456
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:16,649
well over a quarter of the organization

457
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,830
with that type of a password so that's

458
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:23,129
part of your policy burn that thing with

459
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:25,289
fire alright another lovely one this one

460
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:27,809
cracked me up then coming back from some

461
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:29,700
of the tweets I had seen this I wasn't

462
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:31,499
quite sure how widespread this was

463
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,929
actually going to be but head number

464
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:36,299
people talk about test accounts my

465
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:39,749
favorite here out of Baldwin top right I

466
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,940
typed asdf asdf will demonstrate an

467
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:45,690
easier name enumeration in a login page

468
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,029
and it it worked it was a test user

469
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:50,700
created by the developer and that was

470
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:53,039
left in place I've seen things like that

471
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
I thought I was just a random lucky

472
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,649
thing

473
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,909
no there's another one bottom right here

474
00:18:55,649 --> 00:19:01,469
a wiry bull Freddy Krueger and worked

475
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:03,179
just fine

476
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,740
I actually had a situation and this one

477
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,409
was actually kind of bad similar to

478
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,289
David here where I was doing a test and

479
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:11,759
I came across a domain admin account it

480
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,470
was actually for another pen test

481
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,019
company and no I won't share the name of

482
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,929
the pen test company and that account

483
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:22,559
was left left around from about the same

484
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:24,210
time I was there last year and led me to

485
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,519
believe that it was there you know

486
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,980
previous pen test the year before able

487
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,749
to log back log back in with that right

488
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,129
we wanted to make sure we clean that

489
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:34,619
stuff up that should be as part of a

490
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:36,418
process if you do a pen test have your

491
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,249
IR have someone in your team do they

492
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,139
clean up if it comes to those test

493
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:41,999
accounts make sure you clean those up

494
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:43,969
because invariably if it's a test

495
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:46,230
account it's going to have a craptastic

496
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:50,070
potential

497
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:52,310
but other lovely things that are just so

498
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,840
beautiful I almost feel dirty that

499
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,970
unfortunately or I mean of course from

500
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,990
an offensive person's perspective I

501
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:02,460
guess in a way

502
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,020
fortunately work all out - - well let's

503
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,970
see the number of times where you

504
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,190
attempts to log in and the pages like

505
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:11,310
you know what that password doesn't work

506
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:14,520
why don't you try this one the number

507
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:17,580
for examples where these credentials are

508
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,670
just floating around failed logins oh by

509
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,790
the way try this look in the page source

510
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:26,610
is it high-tech no does it work way too

511
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,620
often right we can see here like Zacks

512
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,340
what cracks me up a couple other words

513
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,229
similar ones as well where to make life

514
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,879
a little bit easier on us let's go to

515
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,370
the next page because this is all the

516
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,560
same is what admins will do is they sort

517
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,500
of assume that Active Directory is

518
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,270
invisible to end-users right Active

519
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,100
Directory stores all the account

520
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,590
information they assume that you you

521
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,740
can't do can't look at that unless

522
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,419
you're one of the IT admins so you see

523
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,850
this all over the place where the

524
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:59,610
password is stored as an attribute in

525
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:02,490
Active Directory most of the time in

526
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:05,040
clear text which means if you have some

527
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,750
sort of tool to look at that boom it's

528
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,090
going to rain those credentials down on

529
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,190
you and of course this is connect you

530
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,959
echoed by those those number of people

531
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,520
that I've seen online I don't wanna get

532
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,280
too much in the password we beat up

533
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,530
passwords but frankly I mean it just

534
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,060
happens time and time again and we're

535
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,580
focusing on all these heavy other

536
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:27,179
projects and if we could just get rid of

537
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,550
the password problem a lot of life sort

538
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:32,280
of goes away let me jump on the head

539
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,230
just a touch so you're probably thinking

540
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,760
like well of course if you've got crappy

541
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:40,050
passwords the answer that is MFA now one

542
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,620
of the quote on the guys are my team

543
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:46,649
Mike Saunders like he loves to bring MFA

544
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,409
to its knees it cracks me up he actually

545
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:52,200
in the last two or three pens s he was

546
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:55,290
doing it he was working on just broke

547
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,720
the MFA and it was frankly kind of a

548
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,970
dumb break

549
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,040
so what happened is hit the login page

550
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:05,310
enter the username entered the password

551
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,379
I had asked for the token and all he

552
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,600
simply did is then redirect to the rest

553
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,430
of the page force prowess to them to the

554
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,980
website never says like Oh

555
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,560
fair enough I think the website was

556
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,360
thinking oh if you got to this point the

557
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,940
only way you could get here is if you

558
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,699
authenticated so clearly you must be

559
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,100
okay so you know it was to call that the

560
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,110
the shopping cart problem right with the

561
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,020
shopping cart you put something in the

562
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,659
shopping cart you go to shipping you pay

563
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:36,330
the bill and there you go you finish the

564
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,400
order process the shopping cart issue is

565
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,860
you just skip the payment piece and the

566
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,570
only way of course that a normal user is

567
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,459
going to get to that complete my

568
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,530
checkout process is if they went through

569
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,920
the process so the server just assumes

570
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:52,379
they were good to go and we get stuff

571
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,380
for up for free all right so the mfa

572
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,030
it's awesome but make sure that you test

573
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,880
to make sure that's properly implemented

574
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,379
right let me go back a little bit so

575
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,330
we're talking about the passports there

576
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,120
right all right let's change gears a

577
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:08,460
little bit now this kind of goes back to

578
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,020
hey I was one of the I was kind of new

579
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,440
at one point right of course we all work

580
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:17,160
and I wanted to learn more about IOT

581
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,320
Hackett so I didn't know what to do so

582
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,000
what happened was I looked at a friend

583
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,840
of Mines blog post he had this lovely

584
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,760
blog post here this is 2012 on how he

585
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,550
found this issue in this trend that

586
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,280
camera right so let's walk through what

587
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,840
he did so what he grabbed his he grabbed

588
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,970
the firmware and then he use a tool

589
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,709
called bin walk now in 2012 bin walk it

590
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,410
was it didn't have all the features we

591
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,870
have today but what it did and frankly

592
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:48,960
does is it looks at some things like

593
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:52,399
firmware and it will identify different

594
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,320
section headers there's oftentimes our

595
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,330
firmware is just a bunch of files that

596
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,179
are kind of like duct-taped together in

597
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:02,490
a one file so what Ben walk does is it

598
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,620
looks for those various headers and the

599
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,930
newer versions will actually chop it up

600
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,030
for you now back in the olden days you

601
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,430
would do that chopping yourself you had

602
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,610
to get your Ginsu out chuck chop this

603
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:17,070
Rob so here's an example of where he

604
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,620
used didi to chop up the file in a

605
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,530
couple of pieces now I simply look at

606
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,239
the third fire the third file if you ran

607
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:28,050
the file command on it now what file

608
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,900
does is it checks for magic looks for

609
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:33,300
specific headers or footers in the file

610
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,300
to identify the file type and found that

611
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,360
it was just in Linux file system that

612
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,740
cool just unzipped it uncompressed it

613
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,229
and then mounted it and started looking

614
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,500
around the file system now in his case

615
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,240
he found a directory called server

616
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,850
inside server was directory called CGI

617
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,540
bin inside that was a directory called

618
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:57,030
inany take a guess what a Nani

619
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,550
stands for right a Nani his course is

620
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:01,560
going to be anonymous so it gave

621
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:05,820
anonymous access which means anybody

622
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:07,440
could ask access this webcam and do the

623
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,510
stream this is his page

624
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,100
pardon the the words at the bottom but

625
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:16,170
this is a straight screenshot from his

626
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:18,240
his blog simple access No pretty

627
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,350
straightforward so what I did I'm like

628
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,600
you know what I'm gonna do the same

629
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,510
thing so I bought a different camera off

630
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,780
of ebay I'm sorry Amazon walk through

631
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:30,290
the same sort of process where extracted

632
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,420
did DD it looked a little bit different

633
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:36,300
tracted the filesystem might use other

634
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,120
people's tools and techniques don't feel

635
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,530
like you have to reinvent the wheel

636
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,510
frankly maybe you even buy the same

637
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:45,420
product and walk through the exact same

638
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,300
process somebody else to grab this take

639
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,840
it home now if you grab a Linux file

640
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,030
system

641
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,060
cuz mine extracts it into a Linux file

642
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:56,160
system where's one of the first places

643
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,560
you're gonna look at like the first file

644
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,290
I am I'm assuming most of you are saying

645
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,590
Etsy password or maybe Etsy shadow

646
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:06,480
well with old Linux systems and the

647
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,840
password hashes were actually stored in

648
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,700
Etsy password right hence the name then

649
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,669
we learned hey you know it's not a great

650
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,580
idea to have aspirin hashes publicly

651
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,560
readable readable world readable by all

652
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,470
users so we can move that into Etsy

653
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:25,110
shadow now that's old Linux systems and

654
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:28,080
also brand new I

655
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:30,510
he devices so this device had you know

656
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,879
one Linux account

657
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,250
it was root so but everything's running

658
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,799
his route what's the point of having

659
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,570
etsy shadow and also the passwords were

660
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:44,309
stored using this really fancy

661
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:47,970
encryption called base64 right base64 of

662
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:50,340
course is not encryption so all we had

663
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,960
to do is just decode it I mean you could

664
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,110
type you can technically just decode it

665
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,480
by hand if you took a look at this

666
00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:00,750
looked in the the web interface saw this

667
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,940
this user admin and then looked in Etsy

668
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,460
password and saw admin looked at my Etsy

669
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,190
password saw a viewer saw that the web

670
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,740
interface cool looked in Etsy password

671
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,049
found this factory test user it was not

672
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,110
in the web page so it says backdoor

673
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:19,889
account for for frankly test it had gave

674
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:23,309
us test access to be a camera and it was

675
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,500
a backdoor account that provided access

676
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:28,379
to the device and it was literally just

677
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,390
me I don't spin it I'm like necessarily

678
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,340
special here but I just followed

679
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,320
somebody else's back by numbers I mean I

680
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,449
felt a little bit dirty frankly no I

681
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,889
didn't feel so dirty when I did a bug

682
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,669
bounty and they gave me like four

683
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,830
thousand US dollars for it um but it

684
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:44,809
doesn't have to be oftentimes that

685
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,799
complicated

686
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:49,410
yep you were saying well it's getting

687
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,360
harder these days true but there's still

688
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,190
a lot of relatively simple stuff out

689
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,750
there try some of that simple stuff

690
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,059
first you don't have to reverse-engineer

691
00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:00,540
the arm code you don't have to reverse

692
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:03,090
engineer or some random HTTP HTTP server

693
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:05,549
just look for some of the dumb and dead

694
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,750
simple stuff first another one of these

695
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:11,639
sort of uh situations

696
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:13,200
I had a iPad and I travel a lot because

697
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,620
I teach and I think we do consigned to

698
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,600
consulting I had my iPad I have an Apple

699
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,049
TV and what I wanted to do is I wanted

700
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,730
to watch my Amazon Prime on my Apple TV

701
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:25,918
but it was back in the days when Amazon

702
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,440
and Apple they had this huge pissing

703
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,030
match it was just this weird battle and

704
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,980
then the consumers were the ones taking

705
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:35,520
the brunt of it but I was watching

706
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,320
Amazon Prime on my iPad and I couldn't

707
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,150
watch it on my Apple TV I wanted to

708
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,510
watch it on a nice TV

709
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,520
but Amazon's like nope sorry can't do it

710
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,230
so I looked at the configuration here

711
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,090
every time I lost the app that would

712
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,000
pull a configuration down from from

713
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:56,070
Amazon inside the the configuration was

714
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,760
a line that said airplay enabled false I

715
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:02,970
was like you bunch of jerks the K the

716
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,620
capability here the feature is here but

717
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:09,930
you're turning off by my screen sharing

718
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:12,059
basically out of spite because I've paid

719
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,830
for the content that paid for my prime I

720
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:16,020
paid for the Apple TV I paid for the

721
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,030
iPad like mother this is staff in any

722
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,370
way shape or form they were just saying

723
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,379
sorry you can't do it this way because

724
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,840
we're pissed off each other so of course

725
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,300
I did like any reasonable hacker what is

726
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,600
I setup burp and when the connection

727
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:33,960
came down I changed that airplay enabled

728
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,510
from false to trip Dennis on air and it

729
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,500
said there was an application signing of

730
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:42,270
the configuration was improperly site

731
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,550
scroll down for the configure of the the

732
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,590
configuration at the very bottom was a

733
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:50,730
signature now this is a situation where

734
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:52,830
I typically ask the my class hey what

735
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,150
next and what I typically see this is

736
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,669
this is always it it's really

737
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,410
enlightening and it's this is one of the

738
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:02,100
pieces that kind of led me to this talk

739
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:04,110
is I'll see the more advanced people say

740
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,750
well let's reverse engineer how the

741
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:10,229
signing takes place and see if we have

742
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,220
overrides or is the key available or

743
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,870
something like that

744
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,460
meanwhile I'll see somebody neuter like

745
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,370
what what happens if you just delete the

746
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:20,490
signature okay like Oh

747
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:22,770
dead dumb simple simply just going into

748
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,780
the configuration with burp deleting

749
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:27,000
that signature it would come down to the

750
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:30,600
device the app would receive the

751
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,660
configuration attempt to verify the

752
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,719
signature and then say oh yeah well you

753
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,510
don't miss thing I'm sure it's in you on

754
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,450
and it worked just fine and I've seen

755
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,890
this more than once again how much time

756
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,480
wouldn't have taken to your reverse

757
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:48,330
engineering the entire signature process

758
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,520
and maybe we don't find a vulnerability

759
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,330
there dead simple just try the simple

760
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,429
thing here first right

761
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,529
talk about the MFA let's skip on to the

762
00:30:54,429 --> 00:31:00,279
next one one of my other favorite bugs

763
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:03,190
was the Mac OS bug right so you can just

764
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:06,399
hit enter a few times with it with Mac

765
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:10,630
OS trying to get root root prawns you'd

766
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,279
be like yeah fair enough you tried you

767
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,000
did you did good enough I'm just gonna

768
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:18,010
give you root level access love that bug

769
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,620
is it high tech is it fancy is there any

770
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:23,440
sort of code reverse engineering now

771
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,149
some dude or do that just sad the

772
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,940
computer and mashed enter a couple of

773
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:32,139
times in frustration found this lovely

774
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:36,279
bug religious that is my favorite

775
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:38,979
vulnerability of all kind so we had that

776
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:42,130
mssql so my sequel this is a little bit

777
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:45,159
old now but still my favorite bug what

778
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:49,750
happens is you would authenticate to my

779
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:53,049
sequel and 1 out of 256 times it would

780
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:55,539
just say alright fair enough I call this

781
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:57,129
one the soccer trophy writing a soccer

782
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,379
trophy doesn't matter how terrible your

783
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,570
team is everyone gets the award that's

784
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,789
this it's like hey you know what good

785
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,039
job you tried hard enough I'm gonna let

786
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:08,010
you in anyway the story that I've heard

787
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:10,750
I don't know if it's true or not is

788
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,519
somebody wearing a bone scanner against

789
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,639
their my sequel and the bone scanner

790
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:18,309
reported a specific password as working

791
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:20,049
the security engineer went back attempts

792
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:20,559
to log in with that password and it

793
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:22,779
didn't work

794
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,360
tried it again and it didn't work and

795
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:27,460
then just got frustrated it put it in a

796
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,479
for loop and then all of a sudden like

797
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:33,700
200 tries later it works right

798
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,500
this bug just cracks me up I can't even

799
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,809
imagine the look on this engineers face

800
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,460
when they they figured this one out but

801
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:41,168
again just a little bit of dumb sort of

802
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,090
good force made that one not work quite

803
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:45,580
well so if you want to read some more

804
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:50,019
here's the original tweet there is a

805
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:53,820
whole giant list related to it a bunch

806
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:56,110
of simple dumb hacks there's a long

807
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,519
address down at the very bottom no one

808
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,860
wants to type that so I've got a short

809
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,710
link here let's each comm slash simple

810
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,909
dash app so one of the keys here of

811
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:08,190
course is you never know too much

812
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:10,430
never you never none of these attacks

813
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:14,910
are necessarily that we talk through

814
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:16,770
required super advanced knowledge and I

815
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,930
find myself I don't know about you but

816
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:22,410
sometimes I get stuck in my mind that

817
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:24,450
this next thing that this current thing

818
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:27,180
that I'm working on it's gonna be super

819
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,070
hard so I need to take this to 11 to

820
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:33,330
pull off the hack when realistically

821
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:35,870
this is like a 0.1 we're just trying the

822
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:38,159
simple stuff first related to that

823
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,800
here's an example so here's example

824
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,490
let's sort of walk through this together

825
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,270
a little bit

826
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:47,700
this actually won me a free trip to Las

827
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:50,639
Vegas and a black hat it's a little bit

828
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,400
modified here but I had something like

829
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,790
this so there was a app that worked on

830
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:59,940
your Android device at the time and the

831
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:01,920
goal was whoever scored enough points in

832
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,930
the app would get this free trip and I'm

833
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:07,200
like cool I've never been the black trip

834
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:08,820
but a black hat before I want to go so I

835
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,470
was like alright let's make this work so

836
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:14,100
what happened is when you registered

837
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:15,779
your device it would send a request kind

838
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,730
of similar to this this is just mostly

839
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,520
made-up but the format is largely the

840
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:24,300
same send this request to their service

841
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:26,909
and after this you would get 10 points

842
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,669
10 points for your first registering

843
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,440
okay good deal so if we take a look at

844
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:34,199
this we can see magic here at the

845
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,918
beginning and then data so I was like at

846
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,589
first like hey okay cool how can I get

847
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,850
more points this is the time where I'm

848
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,040
demonstrating this in a couple of

849
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:46,380
specifically in my mobile pen test

850
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,350
course that I used to teach I asked the

851
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:52,500
class like what next right how can I

852
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:54,120
score more points and immediately a

853
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,340
significant portion of the class is a

854
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:00,120
call that looks like base64 let's decode

855
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:01,830
that but think dumb early writes what is

856
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,089
the more simple approach and I hope

857
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:06,330
there's a couple of you at home saying

858
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:08,520
you know what screw decoding what

859
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,930
happened simply just send this over and

860
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,860
over and over again

861
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:15,600
exactly and that worked perfect so what

862
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,450
happened was we would just take the same

863
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,830
post send it in over and over and over

864
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,899
and over again and we

865
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,029
start coin points like crazy now this at

866
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,200
the time my friend of mine Tim tomes I

867
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,820
mean I'm not saying he's not friend of

868
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,970
mine he's still a friend of mine but we

869
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,160
both were competing for this so I'm

870
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,439
sending in my request I've got this

871
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,960
quick little I think it was just typing

872
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,900
a text file into netcat and then just

873
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,140
wrapping it in a for loop and then Tim

874
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,570
Tim don't lay - 53 he started doing the

875
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,330
exact same thing and he started passing

876
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:50,280
me on the scoreboard so then I ended up

877
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,259
using like two threads so he tried to

878
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,790
use in three threads and I'm trying like

879
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:59,490
four and his internet was was faster but

880
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,990
he's beaten and I ended up spool this up

881
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,149
on a bunch of different such like

882
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,490
digitalocean boxes and stuff so I could

883
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,590
blow past him and I remember it was

884
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,200
Mother's Day weekend we were going out

885
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,420
it was we were in Texas we were out to

886
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,160
breakfast with my mother-in-law and I

887
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,530
remember refreshing that scoreboard

888
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,020
don't like I should pass him in about

889
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,450
ten minutes about ten minutes comes past

890
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,490
and I'm getting text messages now from

891
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:26,370
Tom from Greg did Brett my

892
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,660
mother-in-law's Mother's Day breakfast

893
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,940
and I approached didn't mess them with

894
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,040
my phone but he starts texting he's like

895
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,080
hey man what's going on and I thought he

896
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,210
was just asking like how did I get to go

897
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,980
so much faster then we look back the

898
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,230
entire website is down

899
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,840
that's like comes back up a little while

900
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:45,690
later and they say sorry

901
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,870
no more replay attacks and they had

902
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:51,090
actually fixed the replay so we tried to

903
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:54,660
do this again we would get no additional

904
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:57,900
points so at this point Tim is ahead of

905
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:01,319
me by just a little bit like we'll wrap

906
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,980
now I'm stuck right I still want to go

907
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:08,370
Tim's ahead of me yeah I'm upset right

908
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,990
so at this point what's the next step of

909
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,700
course the answer at this point is then

910
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,609
what we have to do a little bit of

911
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:17,850
reverse engineering the short version is

912
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:20,910
we would take apart the apk file with

913
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:23,670
just a freely available tool looked

914
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,950
forward to the search for magic I mean

915
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,990
it was that simple just search for magic

916
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,149
found this function that essentially

917
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,549
what it did is it took the data portion

918
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,420
you can see that here it took the data

919
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:38,490
portion

920
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:40,860
base64-encoded again grab the last if I

921
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:43,169
remember correctly last eight characters

922
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,420
and then the seventh character or

923
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:48,360
something like that and that's how it

924
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,600
built the quote-unquote magic so now

925
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,370
we're able to do is take the data

926
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:56,339
regenerate the unique ID that was used

927
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:58,259
to uh count as a registration rebuild

928
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,480
our magic were like some friend of a

929
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,770
wizard at this point generating magic on

930
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,260
the fly right I think I'm a little eerie

931
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:07,650
Potter up in this stuff and then started

932
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,300
scoring again I had in that point Tim

933
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,100
and I get went back and forth to our

934
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,730
head-to-head and he started writing his

935
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:17,850
with with multi-threaded so again and

936
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,860
stuck with that situation I Tim got the

937
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,120
better internet connection Tim tomes I

938
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,830
guess there were both Tim's that could

939
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,480
be a little bit confusing he's got that

940
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:27,150
better internet connection I'm still

941
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,950
losing now an important thing to note

942
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,580
here is if you remember a little bit

943
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:34,950
about the specs and how HTTP works we

944
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,960
have what's called an HTTP keep alive

945
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:41,669
so what was happening with our scripts

946
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,620
is it was through syn syn ack ack send

947
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,180
the data and then tear down the

948
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:49,020
connection and then we would send it

949
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:51,330
again syn synack up send the data tear

950
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:54,870
down the connection so I was like you

951
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:57,390
know what what if we just connect left

952
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,370
the connection open so we don't have the

953
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:03,330
additional overhead of the syn syn ack

954
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:06,089
ack and the teardown we syn ack syn syn

955
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:08,700
ack ack and then just did it and it did

956
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:10,620
it data and just spam it as quickly as

957
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,919
possible that's exactly what ended up

958
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,750
doing again simple nothing fancy there

959
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,460
nothing like this is silly sort of the

960
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,170
proof force ultimately I ended up

961
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,240
getting it was funny I talked to Tim and

962
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,430
I told him what I was doing after I got

963
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,950
well ahead of him he's like oh that's

964
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,930
pretty cool I'm like dude can you just

965
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,600
let me win this he's like oh you wanted

966
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:33,540
to go oh yeah I wanted to go to go I'm

967
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,640
already going to blackhat so I got my my

968
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,620
free trip there but again there wasn't

969
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,040
anything necessarily fancy with us the

970
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:43,410
very simple piece the replay upfront

971
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,870
dead simple literally you can capture it

972
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:47,220
with Berger just click click and then

973
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:49,470
just get sort of a free pour

974
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,930
it's free money in a way if you will

975
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,980
another important thing especially as

976
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,609
senior people

977
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,849
I saw the quote forget the exact details

978
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:02,490
but confidence is not about being

979
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:05,450
confident and always being right it's

980
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:08,848
about being confident to say I don't

981
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:10,799
know it took me a while to figure that

982
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:12,750
out because I figured as an expert I'm

983
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,250
supposed to be the smartest person in

984
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,500
the room and I'm supposed to know

985
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,300
everything but there is a tremendous

986
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,140
amount of power to say you know what

987
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:24,680
I don't know also you're gonna have new

988
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,060
people on your team teams a different

989
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,879
perspectives and different experiences

990
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,160
and as the more senior type person it's

991
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,890
really easy for us to say you know a

992
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,899
better way to do that and we all work

993
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,730
with those types of people the the the

994
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,910
person who's the know-it-all who always

995
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:44,250
knows a better way to do something

996
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:46,500
that's great but if I'm always talking

997
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:49,230
about how I have the better ways to do

998
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:52,380
it at no point in time am i learning

999
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:54,000
which means I'm gonna absolutely plant

1000
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,880
tell one of the most valuable things

1001
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,010
I've learned is sit back shut up and

1002
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,960
listen any one of these attacks that

1003
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,520
we've talked about earlier this could've

1004
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,650
ended some sort of new person on the

1005
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,849
newb if you will but it come up and say

1006
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:09,300
hey you know what why don't we just try

1007
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:11,580
some this dead simple web right and if I

1008
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,130
had squashed them enough times with

1009
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,069
here's a better way to do it they're not

1010
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:19,200
willing to speak up right get that

1011
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:22,500
perspective there might be a better way

1012
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,029
to do it but I wanna see it's empowering

1013
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,510
I remember being the new person and I

1014
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:29,730
worked in environment where that my

1015
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,369
manager always knew a better way to do

1016
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:35,580
it and it was soul-crushing he was a

1017
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:38,010
smart guy but even when I was right I

1018
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:40,799
was in a way wrong because he was the

1019
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:42,599
smart person in the room don't squash

1020
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,609
that and it's really it's really hard to

1021
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:46,109
you see it all the time in IT where we

1022
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:49,290
kind of want to show off with our

1023
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:51,060
experience don't be that person get some

1024
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,619
of that input use it there's going to be

1025
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,450
a tremendous amount of value there and

1026
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:57,270
frankly it's going to help you learn

1027
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,529
some of that as well so take the simple

1028
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,839
approach right all these are different

1029
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,239
attacks that we saw try this simple

1030
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:05,460
stuff first frankly from a defensive

1031
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,259
perspective we talked about passwords if

1032
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,799
you're implementing the latest and

1033
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:13,140
greatest DLP cool you're missing some of

1034
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:15,779
the mark here if you've got regularly

1035
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,519
regularly end users are using some of

1036
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:20,219
these terrible passwords that we talked

1037
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,868
about before or you've got other gaping

1038
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:23,549
holes that you kind of just don't want

1039
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:25,499
to deal with but you've got budget

1040
00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:27,839
because I don't know some higher-up went

1041
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:31,049
to RSA and bought this latest and

1042
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,460
greatest tool here we need those simple

1043
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:35,670
couple of pieces

1044
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,109
last year anions event where we were

1045
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,569
talking through vulnerability management

1046
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:41,400
and and talking through the process and

1047
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:44,038
and one of the people in the classroom

1048
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,619
worth of the forum rather was saying

1049
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,869
what he did is he just gave each baited

1050
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,660
business unit three vulnerabilities to

1051
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:53,670
work on each month that's it just three

1052
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,249
the three that he thought were the

1053
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:58,049
biggest risk and it was beautiful in its

1054
00:42:56,249 --> 00:42:59,819
simplicity because any group can be like

1055
00:42:58,049 --> 00:43:01,920
yeah I could fix three things cool I got

1056
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:03,808
it but he could give him this giant list

1057
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,339
they're just overwhelmed and they don't

1058
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:07,259
know which one to do first or the list

1059
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:09,029
is too long so they get none of it done

1060
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:10,920
but if you break it down to these sort

1061
00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:13,680
of simple steps with the biggest risk

1062
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,229
first instead of the fancy pantsy a sort

1063
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,089
of behind you tool right another thing I

1064
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:20,249
would encourage you to do - so I'm sort

1065
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:23,788
of trying to pump up the new people a

1066
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:25,890
little bit even if you're new you have a

1067
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:28,229
perspective you have a different

1068
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:31,379
perspective you end you have different

1069
00:43:28,229 --> 00:43:34,348
experiences than I do I want to hear

1070
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,660
that time and time again I hear people

1071
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:40,380
say well you know what I'm not ready to

1072
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:42,149
give a talk I don't know the the things

1073
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,450
to say I don't have the latest and

1074
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:47,339
greatest new attack and I'm I'm

1075
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:49,499
ironically trying to paraphrase John in

1076
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:50,430
front of John which is making me wet my

1077
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:52,439
pants a little bit

1078
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:54,569
but he had some sort of story that maybe

1079
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,450
John will jump here in at the end a it

1080
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:59,160
complete this story but he told me he's

1081
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,960
like Tim look you've got some

1082
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,359
experiences you're pretty smart guy

1083
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,690
which I was humbled by because I don't

1084
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:10,170
try to do your talks that try to impress

1085
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:12,089
the wizards I you've got people in the

1086
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:14,430
room who are just starting out who are

1087
00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:17,279
maybe on the blue team or maybe an IT

1088
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,868
and they need useful digestible

1089
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,079
information if you come here and you're

1090
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:24,150
trying to sort of in a way show off and

1091
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,400
dazzle and everybody you might impress

1092
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,500
the Wizards but is it going to be

1093
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,839
accessible to everybody is LARP it

1094
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,940
across the board and I see this cuz

1095
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:35,369
we'll write blog posts that are more

1096
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,170
advanced and frankly the more simple

1097
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:38,880
ones are the ones that can get way more

1098
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,980
hits on because frankly that's what

1099
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,980
people need so if that's you if you've

1100
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,710
never given a talk before go out there

1101
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,020
and give it frankly go out there and

1102
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,760
give a talk it doesn't have to be on a

1103
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,040
tool that you wrote you could give a

1104
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,980
talk at your local event or whatever it

1105
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,079
might be on somebody else's tool but

1106
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,089
give me your perspective on it tell me

1107
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,890
why it's interesting to you because

1108
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:04,319
that's what's interesting to me sitting

1109
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:06,058
in the audience I want to see your

1110
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,920
passion in your interest to come through

1111
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:10,770
in these talks I want to see your

1112
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,380
perspective on it why is it important to

1113
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:14,790
you and again get out there and put

1114
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,559
yourself out there there's plenty of

1115
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:19,020
different ways to do this there's you

1116
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,549
know local cons there's local meetups of

1117
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,609
course there's some of the bigger ones

1118
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:26,520
as well many different conferences above

1119
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:29,730
us hacking fest included has help or

1120
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:32,190
other new speakers out there do it

1121
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:34,380
please do that the other sort of fear

1122
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,849
point is people are always afraid of hey

1123
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,260
you know what the the more advanced

1124
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:40,049
people these quote-unquote wizards

1125
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,119
they're gonna look down upon me at no

1126
00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:44,790
point in time has app have I ever seen

1127
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,010
this and frankly if they do screw those

1128
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:49,950
people is everybody else can use these

1129
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,869
types of attacks so with that that is

1130
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,759
going to let to wrap up my talk there's

1131
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:57,150
a lovely QR code that gives you access

1132
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,799
to the slides if you want those now get

1133
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:00,990
people who are like not clicking your QR

1134
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:02,819
code fine don't

1135
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,848
but this be the worst way to hack you

1136
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:08,700
ever between my name and two different

1137
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:10,650
ways to as a concept so with that that's

1138
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,299
gonna wrap up the talk questions do we

1139
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:15,359
have any questions I can answer here so

1140
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:18,359
looks like we do have some questions

1141
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:21,180
who is the best noob you know that's a

1142
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:23,009
Kevin Johnson question by the way huh so

1143
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:26,069
look I think that you can look at that

1144
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,720
as who is the best person at Penn

1145
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:27,970
testing that you've seen that just kind

1146
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,009
of

1147
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,990
just got started you're like holy crap

1148
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:34,119
they're really good well let's see

1149
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,189
what's interesting I would see that as a

1150
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,849
different perspective I like that idea

1151
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:42,220
but I think a real power is if you were

1152
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:44,200
experience pain faster and you can think

1153
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,339
you can sort of go back and we had and

1154
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:50,169
break things down into two simple and

1155
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,359
then not to kiss but here but I think

1156
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:54,880
liquid for example John when he breaks

1157
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:55,569
things down to his analogies yeah it's

1158
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,460
dead

1159
00:46:55,570 --> 00:47:00,550
thinking a simple Josh writes another

1160
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:03,250
one where breaks things down to the

1161
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:04,990
simple basic steps really oh yeah

1162
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:08,470
why didn't I understand that sooner

1163
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,640
right yeah the other one holy smokes I

1164
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,899
don't know I'd have to think that

1165
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,970
through there put me on that thanks

1166
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,920
Kevin could you at least text to me so I

1167
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:16,868
could about that one through of course

1168
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,700
it's Kevin that asks that really really

1169
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:20,320
hard question right look questions like

1170
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,868
that Kevin's the guy if you ask me who

1171
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:26,770
we can ask that question like Kevin yeah

1172
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:29,080
I I'm trying to think of a guess I guess

1173
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:31,630
okay I'll go with this I'll take a shot

1174
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,580
buy you some time I remember and this

1175
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:35,740
Kevin's were kind of primed it for me we

1176
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,450
were doing a pen test with secure ideas

1177
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:39,910
and phis years ago Kevin I don't know if

1178
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:42,009
you remember this one and there were

1179
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,560
like two amazing vulnerabilities that

1180
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:46,720
came out of it one was the vulnerability

1181
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,150
I think Kevin it was your team actually

1182
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,250
I'm just gonna promote Kevin it'll just

1183
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:54,400
be so much easier just to promote him

1184
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:56,470
but I think it was the secure ideas team

1185
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,290
that found out if you purchased a

1186
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:02,649
negative one thing it credited your

1187
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:05,560
account the cost of that no so I'm gonna

1188
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:07,330
make him a panelists real real quick

1189
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,119
I cannot revoke this once it's been

1190
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:14,049
granted Kevin don't make me regret this

1191
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:16,240
um so he should be coming on here in a

1192
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:18,220
second that was I think that was Kevin's

1193
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:22,200
team he purchased a negative it was like

1194
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:25,029
a two-factor token thing but there's

1195
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,180
then there that was the first pen test

1196
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:30,550
of Ethan Ethan rubbish from Black Hills

1197
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:33,520
information security and he found this

1198
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:35,470
really ridiculously cool way of

1199
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,960
executing a cross-site request forgery

1200
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:39,609
attack this particular customer I

1201
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,770
remember Kevin like these guys had money

1202
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:43,840
they were very very good

1203
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:45,700
and everything it was very very solid

1204
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,560
and it was like one of your junior

1205
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,819
testers and like my junior tester came

1206
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,620
out with these two mind-blowing

1207
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,350
vulnerabilities right out of the gate

1208
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:55,839
yes yeah it's always amazing I think

1209
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:57,880
Tim's point of paying attention to noobs

1210
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,980
and not crushing them by always

1211
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,810
correcting them or giving them your idea

1212
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,580
is some of the best advice I've ever

1213
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,900
heard well and I also think kind of

1214
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,690
watching and making sure your team

1215
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,730
doesn't crush itself going back to some

1216
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:11,050
other interns years ago wonderful we you

1217
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,400
know kind of start them out by going

1218
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:15,760
through more ability assessment scanning

1219
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,650
results we had one intern Kelsey at the

1220
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,360
time she was just going through this

1221
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,640
stuff meticulously she was treating it

1222
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,920
like an accountant and going through

1223
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,049
everything and researching everything

1224
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,690
and grouping it by vulnerability and

1225
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:30,430
plugin ID and I was in the room with the

1226
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,960
two interns Kelsey and the other intern

1227
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,940
and the other intern was just

1228
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,990
downplaying everything that she said it

1229
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,940
was just kind of putting her down

1230
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:38,529
putting down her ideas and that was

1231
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:41,650
stupid I don't know boy you're wasting

1232
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:43,270
time on that and Kelsey was finding the

1233
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,760
vulnerabilities the other intern was not

1234
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,920
the other intern sounded like he was a

1235
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,840
total badass hacker and one of those

1236
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,010
interns now worked in has for a number

1237
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,900
of years and Kelsey you know what I

1238
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:54,460
can't remember his name but the way that

1239
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,620
she approached things was absolutely the

1240
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:59,140
right way meticulous and curiosity or

1241
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,600
the two driving factors yes absolutely

1242
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:06,009
the ability for a team pay attention I

1243
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:07,690
will also say self-sabotage is bad

1244
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:10,450
people have gotten so ingrained with the

1245
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:12,550
idea that they don't know that you bring

1246
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,799
them onto your team and they're just

1247
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:18,070
doubting and doubting and doubting and

1248
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,780
your job is to make them not doubt well

1249
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,820
do you want to talk a little bit about

1250
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,260
you when you joined in guardians at the

1251
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,390
time they were in Tull guardians because

1252
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:27,820
if I remember correctly you had imposter

1253
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:29,859
syndrome real bad when you started I

1254
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:35,200
don't know why you say that in past

1255
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:37,780
tense because you're yeah good point all

1256
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,669
right I don't want to talk about it

1257
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:42,610
because it's it's Tim's presentation I

1258
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:45,010
feel rude stepping in no no that's the

1259
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:50,380
whole point I mean that I'm gonna let

1260
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:52,000
the noob talk no no sir no by the way

1261
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,180
your explanation of what my question was

1262
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,660
is exactly correct and I want you to add

1263
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,308
your own

1264
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,950
that list of people who are able to

1265
00:50:57,309 --> 00:51:02,049
break things down in very simple

1266
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:04,118
explanations yeah it's not that you

1267
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:05,288
learn that I see other people do that

1268
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:07,420
right and be able to do that is

1269
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:09,819
tremendously useful but they had no

1270
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,740
please I think your story's valuable

1271
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:13,990
input here so please go for it well I

1272
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:15,098
mean I joined in guardians I'm so

1273
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:18,279
ingrained that were not allowed to call

1274
00:51:15,099 --> 00:51:20,650
him the other name so I joined in

1275
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,720
guardians and it was some of the biggest

1276
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:26,319
names in the industry that I knew of

1277
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,299
and I then worked with them and I knew

1278
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:32,410
nothing it didn't matter what and and

1279
00:51:28,299 --> 00:51:36,038
the idea of working with Tom Liston and

1280
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:39,069
Mike poor and Matt Carpenter and like

1281
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:42,130
it's just wow right I mean I learned

1282
00:51:39,069 --> 00:51:43,720
Linux by reading stuff from JBL and then

1283
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,130
I had to be on calls with him and

1284
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,259
explain to him what I was doing with a

1285
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:50,589
Linux box you want talking about

1286
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,839
pressure yeah it was just nuts and then

1287
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:56,349
you start realizing that every single

1288
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:59,020
person you look up to is looking up to

1289
00:51:56,349 --> 00:52:02,289
you or people like you or everybody else

1290
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:05,440
right like we it's all the same it's

1291
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:07,119
Devon part to do that transition if I if

1292
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,339
I could add in there to like my first I

1293
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,470
bought a college actually sort of second

1294
00:52:09,339 --> 00:52:14,950
I interned there left for a year went

1295
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:16,538
back but it was these single worst job

1296
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,980
experience I mean we were put in extra

1297
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:19,900
hours I mean it literally I thought

1298
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,640
about like jumping off of buildings and

1299
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,200
that's not an exaggeration or order but

1300
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,000
it was it was miserable and I kept

1301
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,819
getting squashed and I remember going to

1302
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,910
like the next job and and the boss man

1303
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:32,259
was asking for input I was like what is

1304
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:34,808
this like I didn't know I didn't know

1305
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:37,539
what to do with it I think we hired you

1306
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:38,109
on the team because we think you're good

1307
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:39,549
at this

1308
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:41,920
of course we want your input and that

1309
00:52:39,549 --> 00:52:44,170
was just I don't know mind-blowing ly

1310
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,670
enabling and friendly maybe want to work

1311
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,859
harder and made me a better person it

1312
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:51,099
was it was so much more fulfilling right

1313
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:52,869
I no matter what I think a lot of us go

1314
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:54,819
back in our history and we had someone

1315
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:57,970
that saw us in the early part of our

1316
00:52:54,819 --> 00:53:00,279
careers knew we were an idiot but still

1317
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,959
saw kind of that spark that curiosity

1318
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:04,450
still willing to put the time and

1319
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:08,260
investment into it Mike before yeah Mike

1320
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:09,230
poor I took a class from Mike and he

1321
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,630
took

1322
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:14,720
students to dinner and I got to sit next

1323
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:17,540
to him and this was back in the days of

1324
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,580
base right and Mike was talking to me

1325
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,470
and Mike Mike just basically said what

1326
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:27,500
do you want to be like when you grow up

1327
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:29,689
what do you want to be and you don't

1328
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:36,350
need like I haven't grown up still I'm

1329
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:39,170
47 but um and it's not my birthday I

1330
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:41,990
said to Mike I want to be you I wanted I

1331
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:44,600
want to do what you're doing and he sat

1332
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:47,330
with me we finished dinner we went back

1333
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,130
to the hotel and sat mate I don't know

1334
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:51,410
what time we finally went back to our

1335
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:53,060
rooms and she just walked me through

1336
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:55,100
stuff like well have you thought about

1337
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,560
this have you done this and and then he

1338
00:53:55,100 --> 00:54:00,859
followed back up with me right like it

1339
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:02,869
was hey what are you up to what are you

1340
00:54:00,859 --> 00:54:06,710
doing what are you doing next it was

1341
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:07,940
amazing and and I hope that I get to be

1342
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,520
able to do that for other people right

1343
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:12,530
that's what we all should aspire to

1344
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,619
Devon it's okay I still want to be Mike

1345
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:18,680
poor everybody wants to be Mike or come

1346
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:22,310
on and now he's working swords

1347
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:25,250
okay you don't be him if you guys don't

1348
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:28,400
know the voice Jonathan ham has joined

1349
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:30,740
the panel and he also has a great intern

1350
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:36,619
story as well I'll tell it I'll tell it

1351
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:38,270
really quick nobody home week nobody

1352
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:38,690
believes that now I'll tell it as quick

1353
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,359
as I can

1354
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:46,460
it was it was years years and years ago

1355
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:50,420
when I was still at LMG and and got

1356
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:53,180
called into massive project or one of

1357
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:55,550
the biggest top three software companies

1358
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:58,279
on the planet and one of the projects

1359
00:54:55,550 --> 00:55:00,350
was they had some people in the audience

1360
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,900
probably heard this but they had sent

1361
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:04,400
out a corporate wide memo to every

1362
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,140
business unit on the planet that if

1363
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,180
you're going to be spitting syslog spit

1364
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:11,299
it at this IP address so they had

1365
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:14,540
seventy's didn't know that like 27,000

1366
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:16,310
sources of syslog spitting at a virtual

1367
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:19,070
IP address load-balanced behind which

1368
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:21,200
they had a massive array of our syslog

1369
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:22,970
servers behind which they hadn't even

1370
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,560
massive array of network at that storage

1371
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:27,379
the likes of which I couldn't even

1372
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,690
fathom and all they could do with it was

1373
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:33,970
check the box saying aggregating logs

1374
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:36,290
yes create plugs yes our drive light

1375
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:39,290
they couldn't they couldn't do anything

1376
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:41,990
with it and so the first chore that fell

1377
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,130
to me was we need to be able to make

1378
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,629
sense of this because we're going to

1379
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:47,030
start shoving all that and the Splunk

1380
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:50,930
but we need to be able to know what is

1381
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:53,540
the thing of the 27,000 sources what is

1382
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:57,919
the thing that's generating these syslog

1383
00:55:53,540 --> 00:56:00,500
logs I took one of my interns at LMG who

1384
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:05,330
was just fresh out of the University of

1385
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:08,120
Montana with his CS degree and a copious

1386
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:11,000
knowledge of Python yeah this is Eric

1387
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:12,020
right but no this wasn't Eric this is

1388
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,680
Dave and Harrison

1389
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:18,710
oh okay I hope it ends with David I

1390
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:22,129
don't know how the story ends but well

1391
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:24,710
the way it went was I figured all right

1392
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:26,450
either I'm writing this in Perl and he's

1393
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:28,340
gonna have to learn Perl to work to work

1394
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:31,759
with me where I'm gonna have to learn

1395
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:34,400
Python with him so I bent and and we did

1396
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,290
it in Python but the only way that it

1397
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,780
the only way that it could work out was

1398
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:45,020
we had to do real machine learning and

1399
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:48,200
and David was amazing he wrote machine

1400
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:50,930
learning code in Perl that by the time

1401
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,790
we trained this program because of you

1402
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:55,970
know machine learning it doesn't that

1403
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:57,920
you you you have to tell it how right by

1404
00:56:55,970 --> 00:57:01,370
the time we trained this machine

1405
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:04,250
learning algorithm it could pick out it

1406
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:06,859
could know the source of a syslog entry

1407
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:09,410
by making model of the source off of a

1408
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:11,270
single syslog entry with five nines of

1409
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,290
accuracy and that's that's literally the

1410
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:13,670
only way that you could parse through

1411
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:15,650
that much data to try to make sense of

1412
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:18,910
it right yeah well that was the only way

1413
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:21,650
yeah but that's that was an intern right

1414
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:23,720
fresh out of college with his CS degree

1415
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:26,180
figured out how to do that I was near

1416
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,730
support I was what I was training the

1417
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,770
algorithm the hero I think as you're

1418
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:32,600
used to Perl that right once we'd never

1419
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:36,020
language

1420
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:38,350
I haven't written a scrap of bro since

1421
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,350
man
