00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,170
sir

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,969
okay hopefully everyone could hear me

22
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,190
this is going to be the QuickStart guide

23
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:02,839
to miter attack and when I say quick

24
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,699
we're gonna hustle through this thing

25
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:07,700
it's gonna be a lot of fun this will be

26
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,929
a you know with a quick preface the

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,580
slides are gonna be shared at the ends

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,590
you don't need the screenshot all the

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,690
things I will share it that's a thing

30
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,950
I'm gonna provide sources for all the

31
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,690
things they're in the speaker notes of

32
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,420
these slides which again I will share at

33
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,920
the end and I will use some memes cuz

34
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,149
apparently that's the cool thing you

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,039
have to do um but that there's text for

36
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:30,140
the memes and the like they're in the

37
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,460
speaker notes again once you have it at

38
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,100
the end so that's all good

39
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,780
two real quick just who am I at any

40
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,000
given moment I'm any one of these three

41
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,360
people this was taken a dead one but in

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,130
reality I'm this person so i'm the vp of

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,530
product management at site who you

44
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,060
adversary emulation simulation synthetic

45
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,979
malware bunch of fun stuff it's cool I

46
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,590
also volunteer at the Red Team village

47
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,119
at DEFCON so I help run their 101 track

48
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,920
and I was a speaker there and volunteer

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,380
with ulcer things and I've got a

50
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,209
background in engineering solutions and

51
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,149
cryptography and privacy one of the

52
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:04,700
substitute here for what you are here

53
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,739
for is if you're curious about miter

54
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,390
attack and I guarantee that what I mean

55
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:11,030
I've been listening we've all heard

56
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:14,059
about miter attack a lot just in general

57
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,980
a but also even today so everybody's

58
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,599
been talking about miter attack if you

59
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,369
ever just want to take a step back and

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,920
like okay what is this thing and it's

61
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,930
most practical boiled down way well

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,790
that's what we're doing today this is

63
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,410
relevant to blue red purple whatever

64
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,209
that's it everybody should hopefully

65
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,129
find this a little useful and hopefully

66
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,540
we're going to reinforce what mitre that

67
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,579
is and how it should be used in some

68
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,810
very practical advice I've got some

69
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,480
insights from some industry experts

70
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,010
thing and myself have brought some new

71
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,569
analogies and metaphors and I'll have a

72
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,629
bunch of further reading and stuff it's

73
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,760
gonna be great all the notes okay so

74
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:49,420
what this is is again very very very

75
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,530
very fast review I'm going to weigh

76
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,849
oversimplify a lot of things I'm going

77
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,290
to mention a couple tools I'm gonna

78
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,209
bring a little hundred feedback from

79
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,099
humans but it's not going to be able to

80
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,930
percent comprehensive and I'm not just

81
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:01,518
going to rehash this thing so this is

82
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,530
the Quick Start Guide to my other attack

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,659
from Leiter I'm not just gonna boil this

84
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,580
down it's gonna be a little more than we

85
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:09,200
also have

86
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,640
how-to guides in the industry this is

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,959
not what that is I'm not going to give

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,540
you a how-to guide on how to run these

89
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,400
tools and it's not unfortunately going

90
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,130
to give perfect attribution to everyone

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,740
just I tried and if you see a Twitter in

92
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,850
the bottom corner there that's read it

93
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,380
ok and there's a bunch of stuff in the

94
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:28,940
speaker notes too

95
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,560
so let's get started first off

96
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,780
what's the problem well again you've all

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,970
heard mitre attack uttered many many

98
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,250
many times even in the past 24 hours and

99
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,690
the new things are you know I like

100
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,730
Bryson's tweet here my next presentation

101
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,650
will be mitre attack review of mitre

102
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,260
attack using miter attack or you know

103
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,230
the other one here is substantially uh

104
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,899
mitre attack framework compliant hmm

105
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,450
tell us about that the buzzword bingo

106
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,130
folks have grabbed mitre and are shaking

107
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,040
it for all of its worth and so let's

108
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,690
boil the down again what is my attack in

109
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,060
its most base why if you had to explain

110
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,190
it to someone in an elephant miter

111
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,440
attack breaking it in half

112
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,870
miter they're not for profit they're

113
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,400
federally funded they're an R&D shop in

114
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,260
an organization that does that cool

115
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,470
again oversimplification but that's fine

116
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,488
for our purposes here attack it's a grid

117
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,170
of threat actor behaviors framework of

118
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,090
we call you know TTP's tactics

119
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,700
techniques procedures and they have IDs

120
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,679
so example you know keylogging that has

121
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,240
a specific ID just one square in that

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,680
grid and for the sake of this

123
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,960
conversation we'll talk about red actors

124
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,330
as adversaries as seen in the cyber

125
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,729
security industry so yeah mitre an

126
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,490
organization created attack which is a

127
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,950
framework a grid of a threat actor IDs

128
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:48,200
neat and there's actually quite a few

129
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:49,909
mitre attack matrixes or matrices matrix

130
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,039
matrices I don't it doesn't matter

131
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,100
there's multiple of these things there's

132
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,020
a pre attack in the mobile and I see a

133
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,240
you don't care it's the enterprise one

134
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,760
you care about unless you work in the

135
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,440
ICS industry yourself we're only gonna

136
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,930
be talking about the enterprise one for

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,000
the sake of simplicity okay miter attack

138
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,770
who created this again it was the team

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,320
at the attack team at mitre they're

140
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,000
great um specifically Blake Strom is

141
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,880
kind of seen as the the point person for

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,950
that oh wait hold on no that's not like

143
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,390
that's Blake there we go and there's a

144
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,669
group of people who were really you know

145
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,349
they drove the innovation of this

146
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:25,729
forward they're all great and again

147
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,620
these are all shared in the slides later

148
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,510
so you'll have there yeah and there's

149
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,800
like the do's and don'ts again the

150
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,030
QuickStart guide is what this whole

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,280
things about and we're already four

152
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,599
minutes in yes number one when you're

153
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,359
talking about the miter attack language

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,360
please use it as a common language this

155
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,270
I'm gonna tell you go ahead and slow

156
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,409
down you haven't told the top of the

157
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,109
hour we're not gonna hold you to 15

158
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,750
minutes breathe coz you're about our

159
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,310
heads explode okay this is gonna be a

160
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,340
whole lot of fun if I could do the whole

161
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,430
thing without taking a breath right now

162
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,690
twice that's still okay well thank you

163
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,370
cool I was gonna come for the whole

164
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,370
thing but now I can slow down

165
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,379
do please do this use

166
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,479
matrix is a common language for

167
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:18,399
everybody it doesn't matter how

168
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,068
technical you are or what executive

169
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,719
you're talking to or what team you're on

170
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,339
absolutely think of it as a way that

171
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,469
everybody can understand and speak the

172
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:28,479
same one this question was just even

173
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,399
from yesterday into this Court if your

174
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,229
security organization or your

175
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,839
organization is given a pen test or red

176
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,248
tea and they they're very you know

177
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,169
you're young and your security maturity

178
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:41,249
like how do you look at this giant

179
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:45,159
attack matrix and do anything with well

180
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:47,139
it's again that common language idea not

181
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:49,029
every executive and inside of a company

182
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,919
knows what's the key key vulnerabilities

183
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,839
are and way windows API keys are used to

184
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,369
achieve those things annoy but everybody

185
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,899
understands a big box that says key

186
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:58,149
logger in it and whether or not that box

187
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:59,860
turns blue or red or whatever that's a

188
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:01,959
really nice common language you can

189
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,610
generate reporting out of that sure but

190
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,319
just as a way to speak about it hey look

191
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,869
these are a bunch of boxes these are

192
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,149
boxes I'm worried about meat right it's

193
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:12,699
that kind of idea and so to kind of

194
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:14,800
slowly start thinking about it just open

195
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,379
up the miter attack matrix page and look

196
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,839
at a single box and say well let's see

197
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:23,169
what we can do with this one thing today

198
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:25,479
now to that end don't do not make miter

199
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,399
attack a checklist or focus on coverage

200
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,889
this is a really dangerous thing to do

201
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,990
because as it turns out there's lots of

202
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,719
ways to achieve these goals at any given

203
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,610
moment so for you know example bling

204
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:38,110
bash history right well there's a few

205
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,029
ways you could do that more even more

206
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,579
ways being discovered every day so don't

207
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:44,229
say Oh neat we solve this whole column

208
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,629
or we solve these ideas we are done

209
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:48,279
they're monitored off to the races don't

210
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:50,319
think of it that way again it's

211
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,849
iterative it's just as a way to frame

212
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,310
yourself when you're looking at thread

213
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:57,490
actor behaviors

214
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,010
and so to that end do seek out behaviors

215
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,870
not signatures and this one is really

216
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,400
critical in a lot of the offense and

217
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,040
defensive folks we've heard from today

218
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,400
and yesterday have brought this up so as

219
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,860
an example mitre attack has t 1124

220
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,479
system time discovery and one example of

221
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,740
how a threat actor pulls for that

222
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,810
technique is net time posting pool but

223
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,380
don't just log and signature for that

224
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,880
and say t 11 foot 24 solve that's not

225
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,700
the right way to think about it because

226
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,280
if a given apt uses that in v1 well

227
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,479
that's all good but if the awesome v2 of

228
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,679
their malware comes out and they're

229
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,990
using PowerShell gates

230
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,270
you now have a that kind of broken

231
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,950
signature and so again it's about the

232
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,990
threat actor behaviors and putting

233
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,950
yourselves in that mindset both as an

234
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,480
adversary and as a defender another one

235
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,970
and then Bryson actually just spoke to

236
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,890
this even yesterday think a periodic

237
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,620
table for adversaries it's a chemical

238
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,420
mixture adversaries are made up of

239
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,370
context order and state and the

240
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,660
techniques they use but even though they

241
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,490
might be a collection of given

242
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,380
techniques at any given moment those

243
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,810
things individually are just inert

244
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,820
object noticing of a handful of given

245
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,439
techniques don't just assume oh this

246
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,690
must be that threat actor it's an

247
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,880
indicator it's a generalization so we

248
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,280
need to think about it that way so to

249
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,010
that end we should use these examples as

250
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,010
a foundation one example of a way to do

251
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,810
that is using pools if you want to test

252
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,460
for adversarial behavior count their out

253
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,079
by mitre it's a great open source

254
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,660
project that creates agents of fires

255
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,120
operations it's all excellent right as

256
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,130
far as using it goes even though the

257
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,710
goal might be to make here validation of

258
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,540
given techniques trivial right to look

259
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,740
for specific behaviors and to run them

260
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,599
in a certain order and the light there

261
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,820
and even though we get the ability to

262
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,950
use these command playbooks as a

263
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,690
baseline for defenses and look for those

264
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,690
kinds of specific techniques and

265
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,730
commands you can't lock yourself into oh

266
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,040
well I deployed this threat actor in

267
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,430
this tool and therefore I now have an

268
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,860
understanding of that threat because we

269
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,770
can't assume that these TTP's always

270
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,960
equal those threat actors threats are

271
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,120
nuanced we all know that and they're

272
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,810
really tricky to replicate with cooling

273
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,569
weather

274
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,189
custom-made or one out of the box and so

275
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:14,110
falling into that false sense of

276
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:16,870
security can be particularly dangerous

277
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:19,449
the idea again harkening back to this

278
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,490
common language minor attack is about a

279
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:23,949
bunch of concepts and generalized

280
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:27,249
techniques almost philosophically and so

281
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:30,008
you have to decouple the concepts with

282
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:32,230
their implementation this one from Jeff

283
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,749
McJunkin earlier as well as in Deadwood

284
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,910
the game of minesweeper I love this

285
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:38,529
analogy from the attacker perspective

286
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,969
they're not entirely sure which

287
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:42,550
techniques you might be monitoring for

288
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,839
or even which kind of way to think about

289
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,019
those things are which commands you're

290
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,910
monitoring for as a defender and so when

291
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,189
you're thinking at a from an attacker

292
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,199
perspective the greed is this game of

293
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:55,059
mind sweep which can be a very

294
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:57,550
challenging experience and a lot of fun

295
00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:00,430
and as a defender you can think the same

296
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,199
way oh well here's this entire matrix of

297
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,420
adversary behaviors which of these

298
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:06,490
columns do I care most about which of

299
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,469
these things are in my threat model and

300
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,749
are not because your threat model might

301
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,050
be wildly different from one that we've

302
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:15,759
heard about today as an exam and again

303
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,920
this is especially true for people in

304
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,709
the ICS world their threat models are

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,839
wildly different from someone who runs

306
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:24,878
security and I keeping that in mind and

307
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,519
playing your own game of minesweeper is

308
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,740
really a good idea and I love this

309
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,889
analogy so thanks for that a quick aside

310
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:36,040
and anecdote there is a team I talked to

311
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:38,410
that you have a big wheel of TTP's so

312
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,579
this is a really exciting way for if

313
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,709
you're running and engagement as an

314
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:43,959
example go ahead and just stick a bunch

315
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:45,819
of things on that and spin the wheel and

316
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,469
say okay we're gonna do this technique

317
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:49,059
today so anyway you can always challenge

318
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,079
yourself and think about that way but

319
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:52,760
apparently these wheels are really

320
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,239
expensive on Amazon

321
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,779
anyway the next thing that I do not

322
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,060
recommend you do is copy paste enter now

323
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:04,160
I'm going to preface the upcoming slide

324
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,899
with the statement of here are some

325
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,769
things that I really love and I think

326
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,690
that are amazing

327
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,100
big red canary is an amazing team I

328
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,839
think it's how my great team is an

329
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,160
awesome open-source framework and again

330
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,940
you all can look into this later there's

331
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,069
notes in the slides

332
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:19,560
I don't think practical examples of

333
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:23,819
adversary behavior is super important

334
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:27,359
however I have no idea of this sort of

335
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:29,128
thing became okay right at what point in

336
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,720
time it's like well you know what I want

337
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:31,769
to replicate some adversary behavior I'm

338
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,269
just gonna copy and paste this

339
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:35,249
PowerShell command that pull something

340
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,779
off of bitly and invoking that seems

341
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:41,470
like a really neat idea

342
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,879
what look so just please tread carefully

343
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,379
while you're testing out this stuff

344
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,269
because again you're testing out

345
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,949
adversarial behavior you should probably

346
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,079
have a good understanding of what these

347
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:52,120
commands do what kind of payloads you're

348
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,579
detonating and just tread carefully

349
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,819
because again you all might want to be

350
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:59,859
testing for real adversary and behavior

351
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,479
in a real environment to validate that

352
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,879
your real defenses are working and so

353
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,879
then copying and pasting something offer

354
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,800
github might not be the best idea and

355
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,870
it's kind of odd that we haven't as an

356
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,729
industry have said you know what copying

357
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,920
and pasting this that's okay not those

358
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,499
things that's probably okay so just

359
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,389
again tread carefully and one thing to

360
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:20,949
remember is that you're trying one

361
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:22,829
technique again in the in the kinds of

362
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,209
examples you might find online

363
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:26,739
adversaries are always changing and the

364
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:28,388
attack matrix is always changing you

365
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,610
always have to go back and look at the

366
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:34,180
updates there's all sorts of new things

367
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:36,879
happening and detection can often rely

368
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,410
on specific procedures and then

369
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,519
sometimes they span multiple procedures

370
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,889
and sometimes they span a whole

371
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,139
technique remembering that this is a

372
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:46,300
Rubik's Cube of examples get you to

373
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:48,040
think about it philosophically as an

374
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,290
adversary might and the kinds of

375
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,969
techniques again that they're using not

376
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,099
specific commands but techniques is

377
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,809
important because they're constantly

378
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,660
shifting and we we all know that because

379
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:01,240
we just watch the news okay and this is

380
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,910
another big one you all have standards

381
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,490
that you have in your wheelhouse right

382
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,139
you all have different sorts of things

383
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,149
and you might be a trying new things out

384
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,860
and you might be I don't know they

385
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,959
missed five functions or cyber defense

386
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,850
matrix just because fighter attack is

387
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,199
very cool just because a lot of us are

388
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,699
talking about it just because a lot of

389
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,290
vendors are talking about it and it

390
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,479
seems like a really neat thing to do

391
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,000
does not mean it should be your top

392
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,779
priority it's very very tempting to go

393
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,179
with this thing

394
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,980
that is very trendy the temptation is

395
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:32,230
just put all your chips down on that I

396
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,120
would hesitate and think what are your

397
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,290
priorities what are the systems that you

398
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,459
have to use what are the kinds of

399
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,349
standards that you have to abide by

400
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,300
having a clear understanding that will

401
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,249
be helpful whether or not miter attack

402
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,229
can fit into that or not all these

403
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,699
models are not intended to be video

404
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,339
cards where you check the box in your

405
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:50,709
off for the races so to summarize again

406
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,580
we very fast through that not as fast as

407
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:53,650
I was going initiative

408
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,530
because you know we're allowed to

409
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:58,900
breathe apparently but uh attack is a

410
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,730
framework that can be used as a common

411
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,590
language across an entire organization

412
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,010
on any part of the org chart hopefully

413
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:08,470
and it's meant to be a baseline of

414
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,880
behaviors not specific commands and one

415
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,000
thing that I think is important to point

416
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,620
out is the minor tech matrix regardless

417
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,110
of your if you're using tools that align

418
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,490
to it or you know you're using a red

419
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,260
team or you're blogging about this or

420
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,090
your network defender aligning to it or

421
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,590
you're doing offense learning to it it's

422
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,540
a great opportunity to get involved

423
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,670
because this is something that's growing

424
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,890
as a growing importance to all of us

425
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,290
because of that ability for it to be a

426
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:35,170
common language and so really if you

427
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,420
find any sort of way to blog each or

428
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,459
whatever and and help move the industry

429
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,900
forward by aligning with this and

430
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,590
talking about it and how you're all

431
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,930
using it

432
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,400
it'd be incredibly valuable use it as

433
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,930
another way to get involved regardless

434
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,970
of whether it's with the project itself

435
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,040
or much of the tool in using it or so

436
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,900
and so forth so that's pretty much that

437
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,400
although a lot of what I just said

438
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,390
probably won't matter soon because

439
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,790
they're rolling out this thing called

440
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:00,069
sub techniques and it's just going to be

441
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,199
a mess so I mean that that'll be fun

442
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,400
well edit it probably Redux this entire

443
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,990
conversation later

444
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,760
after those will rolled out and what

445
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,120
they mean for all the tooling that uses

446
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,880
it so with that said apparently we get

447
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,680
to go much longer now I guess if there's

448
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,520
more questions if we have time we

449
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,810
probably don't and I guess finally I've

450
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,660
got a question for you a lot of the

451
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,520
stuff that is coming out is tying to the

452
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,610
miter attack technique matrix and it

453
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,100
seems like the vast majority of it is

454
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,900
basically the company puts out the miter

455
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,750
attack tech matrix outside of their

456
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,490
booth at RSA and they say look we detect

457
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,670
stuff and they don't really say what

458
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,530
they detect my favorite example is

459
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,910
vulnerability scanners honestly if

460
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,010
you're doing just a straight external

461
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,860
vulnerability assessment scan it detects

462
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,230
like two of the possible initial attack

463
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,000
and compromise techniques and it ignores

464
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,100
everything else but they still have the

465
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,480
banners up there and then further the

466
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,700
detection with standard traditional

467
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,290
event logs really doesn't work unless

468
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,680
you start getting into like full system

469
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:05,740
on or EDR so as far as maturity where do

470
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,419
you think we are right now as an

471
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,480
industry for actually changing the way

472
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,520
that we look with attack mapping and

473
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,220
threat modeling and all of that that is

474
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,500
a great question I think we're still

475
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,780
kind of figuring it out it speaks a lot

476
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,250
to how much the framework has really

477
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,230
been able to gain traction in the past

478
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,640
year or so really and the fact that all

479
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,670
these vendors are gluing themselves to

480
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,280
it as its as it's a good idea and the

481
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,840
nice thing is is that yes right now

482
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,280
there's a bunch of scanners that say we

483
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,100
aligned a minor attack and like ticktick

484
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,920
can does two things or maybe like hey we

485
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,330
grep for all the your logs that you had

486
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,190
CMD and therefore

487
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,750
look at all the IDS you found although

488
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,940
that's kind of the wrong way to look at

489
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,200
it it's still better that we're dipping

490
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,240
our toe into the water and might our

491
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,070
attack in those ways and even the

492
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,410
product perspective and they're more

493
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,330
it's more meaningful than saying oh this

494
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,980
is machine learning blockchain selling

495
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,780
that's right it's either attack is a

496
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,670
good thing you were lying to even though

497
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,830
there's still a little bit of a hair of

498
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:05,230
snake oil in the industry if even if

499
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,750
they begin that way folks that are using

500
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,250
their products could say hey you said

501
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,540
you aligned to minor attack and these

502
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,220
are just a couple of the things that

503
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,200
were pulled up why not these things

504
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,120
right and that'll help move the product

505
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,830
industry form and if the vendors to

506
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,449
actually think about so there's a long

507
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,060
answer to a short question John I don't

508
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,580
know if that helps no that's fine and I

509
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,560
might have might have a question here

510
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,480
you kind of bleeding into Bryson's

511
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,760
presentation with your background you

512
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,070
went over it very very quickly here what

513
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,230
is the most difficult thing you think

514
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:39,399
right now and with trying to do full

515
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:42,880
threat simulation and emulation yeah the

516
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,870
the real trick of that right now is the

517
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,460
idea that we're pretty comfortable with

518
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,110
signatures still especially seen when

519
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,790
you're doing adversary emulation in

520
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,620
agent based context because usually

521
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,570
those agents are put on building master

522
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,729
boxes and they repeat no and pcaps and

523
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,439
do that whole show which is good like we

524
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,700
should be validating our defenses in

525
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,500
that way we should be making sure the

526
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,240
firewalls are firewalling we should be

527
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,210
making sure network monitors are

528
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,400
monitoring but it kind of takes us out

529
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,950
of the real world a little bit when

530
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,230
we're not actually detonating even

531
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,780
benign adversary behavior on a

532
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,279
production payload and doing weird

533
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,099
exfiltration events on

534
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,859
production machines because we do need

535
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,789
to move beyond the signature-based

536
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:27,460
dependency that we've been sitting in

537
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:29,440
for so long and start to think well what

538
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,349
is the threat actor actually do it and

539
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,109
how do I move beyond I can catch anyone

540
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:37,080
a cry the bass as long as it's version

541
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:40,149
one because I know it's signature to

542
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,330
actually how do I catch anything that

543
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:45,609
does encryption in a row and so moving

544
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,379
beyond these standard signatures and

545
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:49,749
templates and things we've got into a

546
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:52,149
real live fire environment and saying

547
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:53,379
hey I'm gonna make some custom malware

548
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,699
today and it's going to create a

549
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,738
directory and create a bunch of files

550
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,379
encrypt those files delete the originals

551
00:19:56,739 --> 00:20:01,299
and then extract if they can't download

552
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:03,158
if I would notice that behavior even it

553
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:06,668
wasn't tied to a real threat actor that

554
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:08,440
would be very very cool if you had to

555
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:09,940
take a guess just a wild guess

556
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,769
and we'll use mightor as the baseline

557
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,359
because everyone knows that with all the

558
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,049
problems of being locked into just that

559
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,769
framework

560
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:21,369
how much do of the existing pen test

561
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:23,859
methodology do you think can or should

562
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:25,689
be automated kind of like vulnerability

563
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:28,330
assessments years ago we had to download

564
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,070
tons of scripts and we had to test them

565
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,168
one at a time and we had to do banner

566
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,059
grabbing and lookups and then Satan and

567
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:35,649
Sarah came and made that a lot simpler

568
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:37,330
for us and I was like well that's the

569
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,709
end of red teaming and pen testing

570
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,570
because we have this automatic thing

571
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,719
called necess now and it didn't really

572
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,729
replace it but it basically pushed the

573
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:47,379
the state of the art for patent testing

574
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:49,719
a little bit further out and that was a

575
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,879
good thing so if we were gonna say okay

576
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:55,149
the amount of work that a traditional

577
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:56,769
red team or fantastic what percentage of

578
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:59,258
that kind of grunt work do you think

579
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:01,299
could be done today with automation

580
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,219
frameworks did you know I'm not picking

581
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,229
on anyone automation framework or

582
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:06,999
anything but if somebody was gonna set

583
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:08,379
out to automate it how much do you think

584
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,529
they could actually automate it today

585
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:15,849
the majority and really what it boils

586
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:18,099
down to is essentially the vast majority

587
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,749
of adversary behavior is all pretty well

588
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:21,399
known you know what they want to do on a

589
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:23,409
box we know how they phone home

590
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:26,859
generally speaking and the thing where

591
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:29,080
an operator should take over is lateral

592
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:30,759
move generally speaking and then that

593
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,220
one I call out really specifically

594
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:34,529
because lateral movement can be very

595
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,120
you eventually things and you have to

596
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:39,000
look in documents and you have to make

597
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,279
some assumptions more importantly the

598
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,500
moment you're automatically laterally

599
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:46,080
moving you open the door to like

600
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,029
becoming an auto hacking tool and Auto

601
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,580
hacking tools are inherently dangerous

602
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:52,529
right and no one wants to open the door

603
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,960
to the risk of accidentally knocking

604
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:56,700
over a domain control which that plot is

605
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,190
plausible when you have automated

606
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,769
lateral movement so that's kind of where

607
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,500
in my experience I think people kind of

608
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:06,629
not only do but need to draw the line

609
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,970
both practically and from an automation

610
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:11,759
perspective because you want to test

611
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,799
real scenarios without dramatically

612
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,750
increasing the risk to your organization

613
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,190
by using automation trying to make your

614
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,429
life easier not harder because you

615
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,740
knocked over your domain controller as

616
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:24,960
ya know and the kind of the other thing

617
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,000
about that is I think automating an

618
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,350
entire pen test is bad but man if they

619
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,580
could just automate the same crap that

620
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,658
we do every single time I think that

621
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,299
would be fantastic

622
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:35,669
Lynne geek has a question our GRC team

623
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:37,590
has been very focused with CIS controls

624
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:39,690
it's been fun and challenging to take on

625
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,549
attack alignment by the way I do have a

626
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,990
spreadsheet Flynn geek maybe I should

627
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:45,720
just release it but if you want to shoot

628
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,580
me an email John at Black Hills infocomm

629
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,259
I have a spreadsheet where I went

630
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,090
through and I mapped as many of the

631
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:55,529
attack controls as I could and one

632
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:57,658
airplane ride from DC to Denver I'm in

633
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:59,399
one sitting to the Center for Internet

634
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,049
security controls so if you want that

635
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:02,129
shoot me an email and I will get that to

636
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,629
you and maybe I'll just load it up

637
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:06,240
somewhere as well and seeing if it

638
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:07,799
actually works so Jorge talked about and

639
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,450
said our team focuses on automating all

640
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,009
the stuff that we continually do a

641
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,929
repeatable and then they can move on and

642
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:15,210
use their brain for new procedures which

643
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:18,179
is complete bump it up it up but I'm

644
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,769
trying to see rusty skills asked how do

645
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,659
we change minds at the next level of

646
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:23,789
InfoSec red teaming is great but it

647
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,799
seems not to be complete able to

648
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:29,879
completely change minds on its own ooh

649
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:32,789
good questions yes yes okay that one

650
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:34,469
there's a cheat code for that we kind of

651
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:36,629
as an industry we kind of accidentally

652
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:39,480
did our way into it and as someone who

653
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:41,070
does products in this industry I when I

654
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,570
figured this out or when we kind of

655
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,939
collectively figure this out something

656
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:48,700
really cool happened the cheat code

657
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,559
is thinking about budgets right okay so

658
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,269
the red team budget is actually this

659
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,678
much and it's actually part of the

660
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:55,149
security teams budget which is actually

661
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,620
part of the IT staff budget which is

662
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:58,149
part like if you think of it that way

663
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,418
it's like well they actually get kind of

664
00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:03,668
the tiniest sliver and so how do you

665
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:06,039
expand the importance of the work the

666
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,960
red team is doing you do that by

667
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:10,179
introducing the blue team in the IT

668
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,429
staff and the way we do that is by

669
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,960
purple theming and so again like purple

670
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,340
teaming has became the new big cool

671
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,809
thing it's collaborative and it's a

672
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,699
really good exercise and all that sort

673
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:20,230
of stuff it's kind of tricky to do if

674
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,710
you don't have a red team for example

675
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:26,169
but the idea of expanding adversary

676
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,240
emulation and expanding things like

677
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:30,070
understanding threat actors and why to

678
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,710
not only just the red team but the

679
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,928
entirety of the IT staff you've secretly

680
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,480
expanded to be the entirety of the IT

681
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,730
budget and when the IT budget says we

682
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,230
need to focus on threat actors executive

683
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,720
leadership notices as you're talking

684
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,299
about real impact or real organization

685
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,059
and showing that collaboratively with

686
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,658
you know a blue and red you achieve

687
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:52,809
those goals

688
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:55,389
so talk thinking about purple team as a

689
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:56,950
way to kind of hack your way into bigger

690
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:58,418
budgets and hack your way into more

691
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,620
importance and to get executive

692
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:01,629
leadership to think about it is very

693
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,008
cool either that or you just print out a

694
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:04,689
grid with all the threats you're

695
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:06,450
vulnerable to and show them a bunch of

696
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,429
red squares so I guess that could work

697
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,899
it's as a mechanism it's not the same

698
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:13,419
what I would do but it's a way that

699
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:15,459
works sometimes but I think it can work

700
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:17,710
if you're using the perspective of a gap

701
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,210
analysis saying yeah do the specific

702
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,919
areas that we're missing and here's the

703
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,080
specific technical controls we can put

704
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,509
in place but you talk about the blue

705
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,769
side and there's a lot of times I feel

706
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:29,139
like we're running around trying to put

707
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,940
our fingers in the dam where we could

708
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:32,979
just unilaterally be better at blocking

709
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,870
PowerShell and command execution by

710
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,940
standard users or enabling host-based

711
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,739
firewalls so workstations can't talk to

712
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,929
each other there's a lot of things we

713
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,279
could do but I think that it only comes

714
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:43,570
from that collaboration and then the

715
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,789
only way that we get there is with

716
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,649
results and seeing how we can actually

717
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:49,179
make things better rather than red teams

718
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:50,709
which tend to have a tendency in most

719
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:52,629
companies to show how they can make

720
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,179
things worse and that doesn't seem to

721
00:25:52,629 --> 00:25:56,830
help us all yeah see the only gotcha on

722
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,909
the whole showing the big rip all the

723
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,228
red squares to executives is

724
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:02,799
you then roll out a bunch of new

725
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:06,830
defensive stuff and the squares stay red

726
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,749
ever you you've introduced danger into

727
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,580
your decision-making for the future but

728
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:12,739
again yeah Jana I think that's excellent

729
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,749
advice yep and you touched on on your

730
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:16,849
talk I think the biggest mistake that

731
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:18,559
can be made is whenever you start

732
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:22,009
writing signatures that are too tightly

733
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,869
coupled to an example and miter I look

734
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:25,159
at the Sigma stuff and I love the Sigma

735
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:28,070
project I think it's absolutely

736
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,690
fantastic problem with Sigma is some of

737
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,580
their signatures are like look for a

738
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,950
process that executes with the name mini

739
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,019
cats it's like oh dear God

740
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,580
no that's not that's not what we're

741
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:39,799
talking about making things better

742
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,629
exactly and that's we're just like well

743
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:46,609
I'm just gonna rename it mini dogs see

744
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:48,728
what happens yeah way to a big kid as

745
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:48,728
well
