00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,930
Chris DeRose security 0a Tyrone okay

00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:25,799
he's founded there over seven years ago

staff retention software and services

10
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,390
company called

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,310
now I don't know how to pronounce that

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,320
one you call it commute yes it sounds

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:40,560
commute so very very nice play on words

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,080
there as is the current president of the

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,140
Los Angeles Cloud Security Alliance

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,449
chapter and as a founding board member

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,810
of the original Southern California

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,440
chapter that is now San Diego Orange

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:58,890
County and Los Angeles so well and truly

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,280
a Southern Californian resident and

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,049
working hard in that part of the country

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,119
he serves as an advisory board member

23
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,320
for the national cyber security training

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,020
and education center always known as NC

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,600
why tell outside the office you're

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,270
probably going to catch Chris planning

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,419
his next vacation which will more more

28
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,030
than likely involve chasing powdery snow

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,909
on the slopes somewhere or finding the

30
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,579
next place for his favorite occupation

31
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,359
while not working in InfoSec which is

32
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,880
scuba diving all right Chris well with

33
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,339
that we will turn it over to you sir and

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,280
we'll let you take it away for the

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,909
presentation and exactly what my first

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,170
time doing a virtual conference so it's

37
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,840
gonna be an interesting ones I'm used to

38
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,549
VIP audience participation or you know

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,889
get a bit of laughs they're even going

40
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,990
some actually I'm probably a bit more

41
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:57,119
nervous than I normally would be you

42
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,939
know standing there in front of a bunch

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,520
of people so I would normally take the

44
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,428
advice and imagine in my audience was

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,439
naked but probably shouldn't do that

46
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:08,940
scene as it's a virtual conference and

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,789
so many people home working at the

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,650
moment right a little bit too first time

49
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,790
we'll talk about hatching your security

50
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,420
team

51
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,099
abilities and actually thank you Jason

52
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,328
you said they thought the title was very

53
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,099
interesting I actually think he's a

54
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:25,170
little bit drier so if anybody wants to

55
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,899
hop message on this board and come up

56
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,059
with something a little bit funnier I'm

57
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:35,370
totally down for that so thank you very

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:37,409
much you guys I've already already

59
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,560
actually got my wire up here we've

60
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:42,030
already done it all so just the little

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,489
bit of information I wrote security

62
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,370
twenty years in in tech recruitment

63
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,010
always as an external agent gives you a

64
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,290
real good insight into why people take

65
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,048
jobs online people leave jobs and I

66
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,078
think that this is less is hotter the

67
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,970
basis of my presentation we've gone

68
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,819
through the rest of my background yes I

69
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,769
absolutely love diet and the Sharks

70
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,839
so we're talk about skills gap to start

71
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,609
and of course some of these numbers have

72
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,920
probably changed a lot over the last few

73
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:14,760
weeks but certainly there's still a huge

74
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,738
gap in in where requirements are so

75
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,959
quarter this was before was in the last

76
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,769
year that worldwide there was over four

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,430
million role was open and here in the US

78
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:29,160
over a million all right so I we had

79
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,709
some interesting stats brought up in a

80
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,299
white paper done by I so I'll cut the

81
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,079
stay of cybersecurity they do it every

82
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:39,629
year and they released that about three

83
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,859
weeks ago and sixty-two percent of

84
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,410
companies were saying and they were

85
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:46,109
understaffed and 57 percent said they

86
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,579
they had open positions and I think even

87
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:49,590
with the markets and things going on at

88
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:52,169
the moment there's no way that that can

89
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,480
be closed just by a downturn right so

90
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:57,540
and we're in a really interesting

91
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,190
situation at the moment I like to start

92
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,349
with retention so we're gonna win and

93
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,569
look at patch in our leaky bucket it's

94
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:06,858
no good recruiting and bringing people

95
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:09,690
in you're losing them as quickly outside

96
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:12,629
there's like there's no wonder the CISOs

97
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,728
of feeling so stressed currently if you

98
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:18,089
can imagine you know 62 percent it's

99
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:20,340
saying they're on the star and then 70

100
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,988
percent of individuals are saying

101
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,739
they're actually in playing for being

102
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:27,039
recruited it's oh yeah you've got you've

103
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,860
got over 2/3

104
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,050
potentially Atene they're talking to

105
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,210
recruiters or interviewing I mean that

106
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,950
fact it's not adding stress when you

107
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,200
already know that you need staff I don't

108
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,500
know what would be so we're gonna focus

109
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,840
on retention initially the three reasons

110
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,720
I think it's really important to look at

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,090
retention before recruit money is you've

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,110
got a think about the security community

113
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,330
and really how small it is

114
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,860
if you're personally working somewhere

115
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,500
and you're not impressed with your

116
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,229
company with your seaso with your hiring

117
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,990
manager you're much more likely to tell

118
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:05,550
somebody and if you're talking to other

119
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,400
people in the community that starts

120
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,879
getting around also with the younger

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,008
staff in and the overworking we you know

122
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,740
all of us have known aware of certain

123
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:19,080
companies that are renowned for people

124
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,629
having to do not hours to be able to

125
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,060
keep up with what they're doing that's

126
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:26,039
not really a reputation you want if if

127
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,710
you're not purposely working lean and

128
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,050
then you're gonna have about because

129
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,270
hiring and staff into that environment

130
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,860
is not going to be fun and so when you

131
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,389
talk about the working environment and

132
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,979
new employee coming in to a negative

133
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,490
working environment again you're not

134
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:47,909
setting them up for success as that's

135
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,710
the the problem you got see if you don't

136
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,060
bring bring the people into the right

137
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,419
environment you're not going to keep

138
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,110
them I spoke a few weeks ago RSI and

139
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:59,299
this is something that came up and

140
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,629
actually got quite a lot of attention

141
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,610
people were asking me about it and its

142
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:09,120
retention triangle that I put together

143
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,699
that basically are three things that I

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,400
think that the three main areas of

145
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,560
retention that women we speak to people

146
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,659
and we find out why they're looking to

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,000
leave these are the same three things

148
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:22,889
that come up always everything can

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,979
always be put into these three areas

150
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:29,339
now you'll see top part we've got their

151
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:31,680
job satisfaction bottom left corner is

152
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:35,099
salary and benefits and bottom line

153
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,650
location and commute and what we see is

154
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:40,620
if people have an issue in one of those

155
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:46,049
areas that's not uncommon that they're

156
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:48,180
unlikely really to leave and if they do

157
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,909
start looking what tends to happen is

158
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,740
companies if they can we'll try and fix

159
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:54,360
that one issue right and that's that's

160
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,580
when counteroffers and things like that

161
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,259
come into place so we've done thirty too

162
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,659
many people moving on with just one of

163
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,960
those things if you've got an issue in

164
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:06,259
two of those areas

165
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,080
then typically you're usually looking or

166
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,520
interviewing already and of course if

167
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,800
you've got an issue in all three of

168
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,448
those areas then you're moving on and it

169
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,030
would be really surprised that you would

170
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,860
even still be there at that company I'm

171
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,198
gonna kind of talk in a bit more detail

172
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,319
about each of those give you some

173
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,009
examples of what they are but I would

174
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,039
really encourage you as a hiring manager

175
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:32,449
to have very good close positive

176
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,699
relationships with those that are

177
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,979
directly reporting interview and what's

178
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,240
really important is that you're not only

179
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:39,650
discussing work

180
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,150
you're not only discussing what's

181
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,520
happening there but also you know a bit

182
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,138
more about their life and certainly if

183
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,539
we cannot stop thinking about commutes

184
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,610
and things like that if you don't know

185
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:52,310
where they live you know more their

186
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,199
commute then it's very difficult to know

187
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,889
that they're happy or not in that area

188
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:00,349
so we're going to move on to job

189
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,909
satisfaction well I said let's talk a

190
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,509
little bit about more stats that came

191
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:07,550
out of that I saw a white paper 4% of

192
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:11,300
people reported having their heavy work

193
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:14,240
out and 50% of people were saying they

194
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,099
were working long hours and let's face

195
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,340
it most companies are on the start

196
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:21,469
that's not really a huge surprise and

197
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,599
you can imagine the effect that that

198
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,840
that's on the team culture the working

199
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,280
environment you know those individuals

200
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,489
we're all pretty work well aware of

201
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,140
these being high stress jobs and we need

202
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,390
to be working on doing something about

203
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,789
that the other areas around job

204
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,860
satisfaction or in the very examples I

205
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,260
would say actually also came up as I

206
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,160
Sarkar's top five advancement obstacles

207
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,680
and and they were a limited career path

208
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,410
lack of men's bullshit unequal growth

209
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,279
opportunities a lack of training

210
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:58,399
resources an unsupportive management and

211
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:02,270
that fits consistently into what we see

212
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,730
as external recruiters it's very much

213
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:08,149
these issues that we consistently see

214
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,950
and so you can I think do what do I know

215
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,140
about the people that are working for me

216
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,449
and likewise if you're a candidate

217
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,000
that's actually looking for a job help

218
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:17,800
maybe use some of this type

219
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,100
if I wear your issues really are because

220
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,900
that's going to help you find your next

221
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,400
job and know exactly what you're looking

222
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,029
for and while you're trying to avoid

223
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,170
so going on to salary and benefits

224
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:35,250
salary actually ranked really high in

225
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:39,000
ice Arcas white paper is a consistent

226
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,860
major factor and for staff leaving and

227
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,630
uh another think there's a little bit

228
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,240
more to that certainly we see a little

229
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,430
bit more to that very rarely is it at

230
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,710
the moment anyway base salary in fact

231
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:54,120
we're starting to see candidates move

232
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:56,400
actually for base salaries lower than

233
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,589
they're currently earning and that's

234
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,240
unusual and but the reason behind that

235
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,880
is because of because of a number things

236
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,920
companies are and making up and

237
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,320
retaining their staff better by using

238
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,870
things like good stock and equity plans

239
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,160
they do a great job of retaining staff

240
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,200
and I know that's something that things

241
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,600
like startups have been doing at some

242
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,490
time but you know I've got friends that

243
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,170
work that very large companies actually

244
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,600
funnily enough aren't that happy with

245
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,400
some other aspects of their job it's

246
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,850
very hard to leave when you've got

247
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,709
stopped I'm ensuring every single year

248
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,500
another thing that that people are

249
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,800
focusing on them to try and retain their

250
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,610
staff is 401ks and pensions and health

251
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,449
benefits

252
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:41,040
Theni Co mid-nineteen thing is gonna

253
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,070
have a lot more people looking at the

254
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,750
health benefits they're going and if we

255
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,450
look at other industries that have done

256
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,370
amazingly well retaining staff certainly

257
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,170
the public sector do a great job you

258
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,420
have those pensions are so good that

259
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:58,319
they've consistently kept their staff

260
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,870
for a very long time and and so we're

261
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,880
seeing more commercial companies

262
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:07,980
implementing different things in those

263
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:10,770
areas we're also seeing trends of PTO

264
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,630
and vacation time increasing course

265
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,329
you've got these startups that are

266
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,550
selling their unlimited vacation or PTO

267
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,290
time but then there's a lot more of your

268
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,719
span a traditional companies now that

269
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,969
are trying to be more generous and here

270
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,800
in the US we've known as there's been a

271
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,110
huge gap between the US and Europe in

272
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,209
terms of understanding how people do

273
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,400
need a break and how much of an increase

274
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:35,699
in property productivity you get you

275
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,339
have that family leave is another one

276
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,960
and I know the political climate at the

277
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,420
moment it's one of the few places that

278
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,000
there's bipartisan political support

279
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,300
here in the US and it's having having

280
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,800
been a recent that myself I really have

281
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,959
a lot of respect for companies they're

282
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,939
doing a lot working family leave and

283
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,040
making sure that they go above and

284
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,410
beyond what the main will become at all

285
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:03,300
this year and so the final areas

286
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:04,920
location and commute and I saw his stay

287
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,979
of security actually had the number one

288
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,880
reason for people leaving their jobs

289
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:15,180
work was work-life balance and this palm

290
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,870
you'd be surprised how often we get

291
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,709
people come in and talk about this and

292
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,180
there isn't there isn't a lot of

293
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,580
surprise in this because things have

294
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,150
changed a lot over the last few years it

295
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,620
wasn't that long ago that we used to we

296
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,840
used to do these things took one or two

297
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,180
ways right you knew where he lived and

298
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,310
you knew where you worked and the only

299
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,680
way that changed or you reduced your

300
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,780
community either moved house will you

301
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,439
move jobs and then it was pretty simple

302
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:46,709
and we've come so far with technology

303
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,980
and the ability turtle to do a lot more

304
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:52,320
in this area and the there's there's a

305
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,870
lot more options like I said reading a

306
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,570
stat that the average American drive 60

307
00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:00,180
miles each way and spend one hour

308
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,470
commute it's that's 32 miles in total I

309
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,620
can tell you that's definitely not

310
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,780
somebody in Los Angeles and most of the

311
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,360
competitive markets in the cybersecurity

312
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:12,630
actually have the very worst traffic

313
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,070
there there was a some some commute

314
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,580
information for out that people were

315
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:20,130
value in but every one minute of time

316
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,590
they spent commuted commuting they

317
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,220
valued it the same as a 1% raise in pay

318
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:29,750
and so it's really interesting to watch

319
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,970
companies work harder on remote working

320
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,110
also doing flexi time around the hours

321
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,610
that people have to be in and out of the

322
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,920
office that's a very common one here

323
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,300
across Angeles people having satellite

324
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,459
offices or companies looking at having

325
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,729
satellite offices or utilizing

326
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:48,690
co-working spaces small groups in the

327
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,340
Bay Area lots of company transport buses

328
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,170
brought in for bringing in their staff

329
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,680
from Sur

330
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,290
and public transport there's big

331
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,599
investment in that and a big promotion

332
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,000
by companies as well as local government

333
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,779
for people to be using more public

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,399
transport

335
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,100
I think what's very interesting at the

336
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,890
moment is the thing with the whole

337
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,290
corona virus pandemic we're gonna see a

338
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:15,319
lot of companies that could if they'd

339
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:18,860
have wanted to go more ammo or offer

340
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,709
more remote actually having or being

341
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,269
forced to do so and I think that could

342
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:25,459
actually be a very positive outcome from

343
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,829
from what's happening because many

344
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:31,569
companies don't do it our choice then

345
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:33,949
they're not it's not something that they

346
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,110
that they can't do it's just that they

347
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,149
choose not to offer it and so perhaps

348
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,339
being forced on on that will make a big

349
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,950
difference so we'll see what happens

350
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:46,820
we've seen some interesting changes with

351
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:48,079
remote workers we're getting most of the

352
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,940
people requesting a hundred percent

353
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,040
remote actually have never worked a

354
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,450
hundred percent of remote and that

355
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,160
hundred percent remote workers that are

356
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,290
out there we see more and more actually

357
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,149
call us and say I'm kind of looking for

358
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,680
a hybrid that I miss going into the

359
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,370
office I'd like to just go in a couple

360
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,560
of days a week

361
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,449
what sort companies have you got that

362
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,699
local to me that maybe will allow that

363
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,399
so that's another good thing to think

364
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:12,920
about so you've got those different

365
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,589
areas in my life coined my retention

366
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,180
triangle I'm really really recommend

367
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:22,279
that you do a swath of of your business

368
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,439
and the company and you understand what

369
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:27,079
your company's strengths and weaknesses

370
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,760
are around retention and also what the

371
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:30,859
opportunities and threats are so if

372
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,230
you're a company that could offer work

373
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,019
from home two days a week there pays for

374
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,449
certification sends needles conferences

375
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,010
even in a virtual then you know that

376
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:41,300
they Daniel strains and you should be

377
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,130
selling on those strengths and you

378
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,959
should be working on them to make sure

379
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,089
that they contain that they continue to

380
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,449
be a string and then your weaknesses are

381
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:52,940
I know as another friend of mine that

382
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,260
works for a company that they know that

383
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,980
they don't pay very well they're a

384
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:59,899
non-profit right and they know that

385
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,089
people tend to do pretty long hours but

386
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,260
they are a hundred percent remote and

387
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,860
they do

388
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,170
papers

389
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,740
vacations and it's it's and really

390
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,000
enjoyable place to work and and you're

391
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,019
working in a great environment so they

392
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,730
know their strengths and their

393
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:15,740
weaknesses and they play playing to

394
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,240
their strengths and of course they're

395
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,670
always working on their weaknesses and

396
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,230
that's what you've got to do and terms

397
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,849
of opportunities and threats obviously

398
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,100
these are external I'm assuming most

399
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,500
people know what SWAT SWAT analysis is

400
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,690
Bob kids and threats are externally what

401
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,370
you've got out there so what can you do

402
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,040
what opportunities have you got that

403
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,350
will actually bring through more more

404
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,750
candidates will make the current people

405
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,190
you've got happy you're the threats it's

406
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,010
good to be aware of them you know

407
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,680
failing to plan failing to plan is

408
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,839
planning to fail as they say so I really

409
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,430
encourage people doing a SWOT analysis

410
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,529
so I'm just going to go through a few

411
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,930
actions from the retention part of this

412
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:56,240
I think it's really important you build

413
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:59,449
very good relationships with your direct

414
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,490
staff certainly there's a sea so that we

415
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,640
play them based at a very high profile

416
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:08,000
company and just I was speaking to him

417
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,650
about about what lead us to retain start

418
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,109
because I know that the company do a

419
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,120
really good job around retention and as

420
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:16,698
well as they're sort of monthly meetings

421
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,500
internally he ensures that his direct

422
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,660
reports have a monthly meeting

423
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,910
externally so just revel a cup of coffee

424
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,319
it's not makes makes it sound like a big

425
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,750
thing but it's it's just grabbing a cup

426
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,030
of coffee shooting the breeze talking

427
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,200
through how things are and it's amazing

428
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,030
you can build that kind of relationship

429
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,679
you'll get to know your staff a lot more

430
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,270
and you'll get to know some of the stuff

431
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,010
perhaps they're dealing with inside and

432
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,870
outside work they wouldn't typically

433
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,700
tell you as their boss so I really

434
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,370
recommend building a relationship with

435
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,350
your staff and if you do there you're

436
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,969
leaving those people you'll probably

437
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,639
find they'll do it they'll be doing the

438
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,400
same so I really encourage it the other

439
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,070
thing is is to make sure that you're

440
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,030
using the retention triangle so that

441
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,799
that little thing I think about where

442
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,260
each person that works for you sits in

443
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,730
that triangle and what potential issues

444
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,530
they've got and then make sure you're

445
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,809
doing the SWOT analysis you understand

446
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,879
your company's capabilities it's really

447
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,360
important to really really importantly

448
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,950
you focus on positive changes and you

449
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,110
work on areas that you really think you

450
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,650
can improve

451
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:23,020
what well I think you then have to do is

452
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:26,080
make sure you treat all-star fairly and

453
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,629
equally so I kind of understand that it

454
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,389
might be that one member of staff that

455
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,950
had that that delivers miles away that's

456
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,950
going to have the most benefit of being

457
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,530
able to work only or have some flexi

458
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,150
time but you need to make sure that

459
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,770
that's not the only person that gets

460
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,320
that opportunity it's the same across

461
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,930
the team because somebody locally might

462
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,210
just as well really enjoy that benefit

463
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,800
so just make sure you're doing that

464
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:54,550
so those mind actions from the retention

465
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,889
path talk now recruitment 32% of

466
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,990
companies say it takes six months or

467
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,300
more to fill those positions and we

468
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:05,020
really see that with we see clients that

469
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,030
come to us in the six nine months yeah

470
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,460
most the companies that come to us for

471
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,620
that think the issue is out there in the

472
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,600
marketplace and they don't actually

473
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,580
realize that their recruitment process

474
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,320
is broke once we sit down with them and

475
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,300
we go through some of the stuff we're

476
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,820
going to talk about here our average

477
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,520
time from from taking a new job 'enter

478
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,600
two places four weeks you know that's

479
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,580
something that could have been looking

480
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,580
for the six or nine months and most of

481
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,020
time the issue is actually sitting there

482
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,960
it's with the company it needs to be

483
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,600
fixed so it's the same same two issues

484
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,380
that we see its quality of applicants

485
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,610
and that kind of matches that they're

486
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,860
there the complaints of people that's

487
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,139
one talking about and then when you look

488
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,340
at the eye socket at stars seventy

489
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,530
percent of companies said that

490
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,510
candidates were not bye-bye and then if

491
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,580
we already know that quantity is an

492
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,620
issue because there's prime 1161

493
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,689
thousand jobs open in North America I

494
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,489
burn in mind that there's a hundred and

495
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,320
five thousand people currently working

496
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,930
in cybersecurity now of course that's

497
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,960
the u.s. that's not the whole of both

498
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:10,480
market that gives you an idea of you

499
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,940
know we clearly do need more people so

500
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,940
you know there are areas out there but

501
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,580
I'm gonna firm believer that most of the

502
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,130
time they're already out there just you

503
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,960
need to put some things in play to

504
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:26,410
actually find them we're gonna start

505
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,120
with job description that's what you're

506
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,570
using to make sure that you've got the

507
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,610
right people you

508
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,320
really really Mormon that you have a

509
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,719
good understanding of what the person

510
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,879
will do day to day not not what you hope

511
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,320
they will do not what what what you know

512
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,290
you'd like them to do but what the name

513
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,939
what must they do today today and then

514
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,470
you're going to look at the skills

515
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,990
they're going to need to have to do that

516
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,450
and then you're gonna have to look like

517
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,120
what's really essential and what's

518
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,950
desirable skills and and you've got to

519
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,139
really put some pressure on yourself to

520
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,600
do that because it's very easy we talk

521
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,040
about scope creep yeah quite a lot in in

522
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,870
pen testing and things like that but it

523
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,260
equally happens in recruitment we

524
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:08,449
constantly see desirable skills ending

525
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,580
up as essential skills when there's no

526
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,170
need for that and it makes things even

527
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,090
tougher then you've got to look at that

528
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,920
absolute minimum are those essential

529
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,659
skills the absolute minimum skills you

530
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,740
can bring people in with and again

531
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:22,250
you'll be honest with yourself about

532
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:26,690
that and then finally and then this is

533
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:29,690
the crux of everything you need to it's

534
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:32,210
almost a sanity check art do these

535
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,760
skills even go together not not within

536
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:37,250
your company but externally other

537
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,640
companies are these skills that you see

538
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:43,100
come together so this is Sam just

539
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,500
because Sam could do this role doesn't

540
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,870
mean it's common people with six arms

541
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,640
aren't that common funnily enough and if

542
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,169
you've got Sam in your business it's

543
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,060
really important you the truth you treat

544
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,890
them really well and you make sure they

545
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,919
happy if you want to find another six

546
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,360
six arms Sam you're gonna be tough it's

547
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,820
gonna be real tough so in the

548
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,459
cybersecurity industry that Sam would be

549
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,740
referred to as a purple squirrel or or

550
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,760
or a purple unicorn which are they I've

551
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,470
never actually quite got the whole

552
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,910
purple you did book and it figured

553
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,560
doesn't really matter what color that

554
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,930
you call unit one is still gonna be

555
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,270
pretty much fine Sam's doing multiple

556
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:20,930
jobs right really if you need another

557
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:23,150
Sam or you're replacing Sam it's gonna

558
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:26,210
be really really tough to find find that

559
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,790
person does that mean you can't build a

560
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,050
position now nothing does it mean you're

561
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,950
gonna have to be more flexible yeah

562
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:34,980
definitely does these

563
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,539
the most common options we see when when

564
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,340
people go now and they're struggling in

565
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:40,980
that they're trying to find maybe a sale

566
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,250
or just a very in high-end Demant

567
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,779
person and I put a little there's many

568
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,000
white icons there and sort of around

569
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:51,149
costs and the amount of time it takes

570
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,389
actually used was a hiring manager and

571
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:56,070
the cost that you'd be looking at number

572
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:57,928
one you can go out and you can

573
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,070
headhunter person and then typically

574
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:01,080
you're probably going to go to an

575
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,939
external company that specializes doing

576
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,330
that for some kind of retained search

577
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,620
it's gonna cost you a lot more than

578
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:10,769
generally how you go out recruit but

579
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,928
you're giving the time and you're giving

580
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:14,639
that to somebody else to do and so from

581
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:16,710
you new person is a hiring manager what

582
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:18,899
you get delivered back should be superb

583
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,070
quality candidates that are qualified so

584
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,750
it should take you the least amount of

585
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,820
time but it's going to take the most of

586
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,010
your budget not most of your budget but

587
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,689
it's gonna cost more to budget and then

588
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,419
secondly you could recruit somebody

589
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,120
that's maybe your one skill set and then

590
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,010
you could train them into the other one

591
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,178
that's always an option and something

592
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,220
like that you can go and do a

593
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,049
contingency search if somebody external

594
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,669
or maybe your internal recruit the team

595
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:44,190
know what they're doing and they can

596
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:46,110
help you with that and then the third

597
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,610
option is you hire somebody and you

598
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,500
train them with both skills and that

599
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,959
might be maybe looking at somebody

600
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,429
that's a little bit more junior and and

601
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,649
bringing them into the company or

602
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,779
finally you could cross train right you

603
00:23:55,649 --> 00:24:00,178
love not a lot of people that they're

604
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,679
looking internally at the staff they've

605
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:04,139
already got within the team but also

606
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,000
externally to the team people are always

607
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:07,350
interested in changing roles and this is

608
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,779
something that actually helps a lot

609
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,000
retention looking at who you've already

610
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,580
got looking at who would be a good fit

611
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,899
and bringing them in as a there's much

612
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,939
less risk with that as well because

613
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:20,129
they're already in the environment and

614
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,529
you you you really know them very well

615
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,480
so they're there the typical four option

616
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:26,970
as we see that people go down so

617
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,370
recruitment if you pick probably near

618
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,960
the top three you might go down the row

619
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,250
or setting the top one and then maybe

620
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,380
top two you're gonna go down the role of

621
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,149
an external search and these are the

622
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,330
most common ways we see people doing an

623
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:40,260
external search so that they advertise

624
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,639
we can look at these and them in a

625
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,509
little bit more detail but they'll

626
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:47,539
advertise they'll use their internal

627
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:50,899
team they'll use an external recruitment

628
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:54,289
agency and they'll use their network so

629
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:56,208
advertising is kind of the first area

630
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:58,639
I'm going to talk about let's just think

631
00:24:56,209 --> 00:25:00,619
about this for a second right you're

632
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:03,468
going to advertise the people that work

633
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:05,718
in security and privacy and then you're

634
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:07,999
going to expect them to respond by

635
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:12,109
sending their personal data through an

636
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:15,019
advert to get added on to a database for

637
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:17,269
who knows how long and they're gonna

638
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:18,859
receive standardized responses to the

639
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:20,779
things that they send then they may or

640
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:24,109
may not ever hear back from from that

641
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:28,069
company strangely enough this doesn't

642
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:31,069
work it's broken right advertising for

643
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:33,289
cyber security it doesn't work it really

644
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:34,969
doesn't now do we still do it yes we

645
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:37,699
still do it do other companies still do

646
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:40,429
it yes they do it and sometimes that's

647
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:42,679
more about advertising and branding of

648
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:45,409
the company more than actually bringing

649
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,019
qualified staff we talk about the

650
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:50,359
internal recruitment team aisaka had

651
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:53,299
some stats on this and they were pretty

652
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:56,208
interesting 72% of cyber security

653
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:58,158
professionals don't believe that the HR

654
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:59,989
department actually understands their

655
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,809
their hiring needs that's pretty scary

656
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:05,269
stat now i am i've only ever worked

657
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:07,399
externally i've worked with with some

658
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:08,989
terrible Winterthur recruiters and I've

659
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:12,379
worked with some absolutely amazing maps

660
00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:14,440
so I don't think this this issue Falls

661
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:17,269
solely or squarely on the shoulders of

662
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,559
internal recruiters and HR but there's a

663
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:19,729
few things that you should be thinking

664
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,559
about and qualifying

665
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:22,909
when you look at your internal

666
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,489
recruitment team do they actually

667
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:27,079
understand what you're looking for but

668
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:29,839
really understand right they're just

669
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:32,479
using it in to check box to to check on

670
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,908
what they think they see on a on a

671
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:36,049
resume on a piece of paper what do they

672
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:38,149
know you know if they're looking for

673
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:39,619
this one skill do they know that these

674
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:41,599
are similar skills that would be

675
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:43,728
acceptable these are areas you could

676
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,989
cross train people from that's a big one

677
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:47,569
do they understand what they're doing

678
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:49,069
and then secondly do they focus just on

679
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:50,719
security and some people might think

680
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:53,299
that's a little crazy but there are very

681
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:55,459
large companies out there that do have

682
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:58,039
dedicated internal recruiters that work

683
00:26:55,459 --> 00:27:00,049
just in one area and then there's a big

684
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,879
benefit to doing that but it's not

685
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,709
possible to most companies most

686
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:06,019
companies can't afford to have

687
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:07,579
recruiters just recruiting for one team

688
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:09,919
you have to have a very very big team to

689
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:13,339
be able to do that and if not it's a

690
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,889
real struggle to to build a network in

691
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:17,389
our industry in in the short period of

692
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:18,379
time that you work on security

693
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:20,269
requirements

694
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:23,658
if you flip constantly flipping between

695
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:26,089
security and accounting and wherever

696
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:27,739
else it might be how can you ever be a

697
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:30,829
specialist how can you ever keep your

698
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:32,599
your network up today because habits

699
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:35,619
come on and off the market so quickly

700
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:38,629
it's very tough to do and then finally

701
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:40,249
is your internal recruitment team of

702
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:42,529
people in it involved in the local

703
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:44,959
community I think the only time I see

704
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:46,909
internal recruiters at conferences or if

705
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:49,279
they're sponsoring or they've got a

706
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:52,299
booth I'm thinking in the last eight

707
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,799
years if I've met an internal recruiter

708
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:57,289
outside of that I haven't met many Oh

709
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,819
conferences but certainly not a meetups

710
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:00,469
anything where you know you you're

711
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:02,089
spending your evenings going to security

712
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:04,159
meetups and things like that and I think

713
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:05,869
I've ever met an internal recruiter but

714
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,469
the ones that they're hosted I will say

715
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:11,418
that and we'll talk a bit about that in

716
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:12,889
a second but are they involved they need

717
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,999
to be involved in the local community if

718
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:15,379
they're going to build any kind of

719
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:17,779
network and know what they're looking

720
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:20,029
for so talk about external recruitment

721
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:22,039
agencies you actually need to ask

722
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:25,279
exactly the same questions as you do for

723
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:27,399
your internals and do they really truly

724
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,869
understand what they're looking for are

725
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:31,218
they just using check boxes do they

726
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:33,589
actually know this skill goes with that

727
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:35,479
skill do they focus only on security

728
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:38,300
there are a lot of people that will tell

729
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:40,130
you they focus just on security

730
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,570
when you go onto their website and have

731
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,040
a look what they're advertising I think

732
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,450
you probably find that majority are

733
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,980
looking right across the board they're a

734
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,770
generalist agency maybe they're

735
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,630
generalist IT but that's a very

736
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,879
different skill set in a very different

737
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:56,480
network and so bear that in mind and the

738
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:00,500
same of the local community there if one

739
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:03,200
day I'm recruiting for a helpdesk person

740
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,450
and the next day I'm recruiting for an

741
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,950
asset person they're very different how

742
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,230
can I spend my time in all these

743
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,510
communities and build my network that's

744
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,090
a real challenge and then finally your

745
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,770
network

746
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,870
and I put you a little star up here by

747
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,270
you or because your tongue doesn't just

748
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:22,899
mean you personally it means your team

749
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,550
it means your company and you need to

750
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,390
make sure every but everybody's stuck on

751
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:30,879
the same page with this now local the

752
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:33,670
local community stuff I'm a big

753
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,620
proponent for you saw in my bio that I

754
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:38,710
mean that's one of the founding members

755
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:41,590
of the Cloud Security Alliance so in the

756
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:44,020
sonar chapter I'm a member of Issa and I

757
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:46,030
was and I go to those meetings I'm

758
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:49,629
involved but also be with some around

759
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:52,450
diversity as well and we we back

760
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:54,880
coaching sessions for that I saw it as

761
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,410
Schiele and surveillance so when you

762
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,320
think about the local community are you

763
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,810
involved you know si si o what I saw her

764
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,330
is si plus lots of people do their own

765
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:07,149
individual meetups and do you encourage

766
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,340
your team to be involved in those to you

767
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,290
are you involved in them and also

768
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,949
diversity is such a big subject right

769
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,360
now and I will truly believe that a lot

770
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,070
of people that are complaining about not

771
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,959
getting enough diverse candidates aren't

772
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,600
doing enough there are groups like cyber

773
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:26,650
Jitsu biases women in security and

774
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:29,520
privacy the my CMC PE Diana initiative

775
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:32,320
these are all great places to me

776
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,330
potentially diverse staff so make sure

777
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,060
that your your your supporting them

778
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:39,070
you know hosts host events sponsor them

779
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,200
and encourage your team to get involved

780
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,750
that's going to be a really good play to

781
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,090
beuter to find good quality local staff

782
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,760
and then conferences do team members go

783
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,889
do you go do you make sure that everyone

784
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,570
attending has an understanding of what

785
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,330
requirements you've got just in case

786
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,850
they need that cloud security person you

787
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,980
know in the bar having X so you know

788
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,250
make sure that you're communicating that

789
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,980
and they're doing those things and then

790
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:07,590
referral scheme it's pretty uncommon now

791
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,040
for us to find companies that don't have

792
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,340
referral schemes

793
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,690
everybody's doing them we've seen

794
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,220
numbers up to five and thousand dollars

795
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,080
for companies that get people

796
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,930
recommended so you know there's some

797
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,000
really big numbers in there and it's

798
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,620
important that you know you've got

799
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,270
something that makes people stop and

800
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,479
think and think hey all this quest could

801
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,250
be

802
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,640
good but if you haven't got the

803
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:32,830
retention path sorted you stop on happy

804
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,480
then that they might recommend that the

805
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,159
other person they bump into that they

806
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,919
don't really know if it they're not

807
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,690
gonna probably recommend somebody that

808
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:42,370
they have a lot of respect for so make

809
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:45,070
sure that that you've got that retention

810
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,840
side sorted to really get the most stamp

811
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,149
your referral scheme and then finally

812
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,000
research and presentations so this is

813
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,910
all about credibility and branding of

814
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,309
your team you potentially if you receive

815
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,960
so or a hiring manager of the actual

816
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:01,750
company as well you want to really

817
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,100
support your people and and want them to

818
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,580
get involved in this and then I'm going

819
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:08,159
to talks about not being overworked many

820
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,889
people in the cyber security industry

821
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:14,980
come home and work on their own personal

822
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:16,929
security related projects and that is

823
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,330
their relaxing time so they don't think

824
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:20,890
they don't think of that as work so you

825
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,370
know if you want to encourage people to

826
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,169
do that

827
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:25,000
that's things that they're actually

828
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:26,679
going to motivate them in and you can

829
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,660
watch your referrals increase off the

830
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,660
back of that sort of stuff so

831
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,139
head here people if you get in your

832
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,570
volume through but you're still not

833
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,580
finding the person you're gonna have to

834
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:43,520
face facts

835
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:45,560
either the person doesn't exist

836
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,010
ie your your requirements are

837
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:51,560
unreasonable secondly you can't attract

838
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:53,810
them right wherever they're working and

839
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,480
there's clearly not many of them they're

840
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:58,639
very happy they're being paid perhaps

841
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,020
very very well they're locked in it's a

842
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,280
great place to work you can't attract

843
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,440
they're not applying for jobs they're

844
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,080
not looking or finally is your process

845
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,900
now the top two you need to go back

846
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,159
again and look at your jobs back and

847
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,440
start back from there and make sure that

848
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,360
that you've got something that's

849
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,310
reasonable or work where you can make

850
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,919
that little bit more flexibility so

851
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:22,070
let's look at your process your creative

852
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:25,790
process who screens your resumes I hear

853
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:28,280
so much frustration from people and

854
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,020
candidates out there that have sent

855
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,360
resumes to places and never heard

856
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:35,060
anything back or they get turned down

857
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,740
and we've got the job when I'm speaking

858
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,929
to them looking at them saying I have no

859
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,150
idea why this person didn't at least get

860
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,430
interviewed so really think about who's

861
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:46,430
screening your resumes are they using

862
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,560
those check boxes because you're using

863
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,060
check boxes for skills and that person

864
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,580
doesn't really know what they're doing

865
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:56,090
you're probably losing out on a lot of

866
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,919
potential candidates say do they really

867
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:02,030
understand what they're looking for and

868
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:04,280
then just a thing that I recommended do

869
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,990
you sit down with your internal

870
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,029
recruiters do you look at some of the

871
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,650
rejected resumes to make sure that

872
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,110
they're doing a good job of rejecting

873
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:13,910
the right ones and you're not losing

874
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,620
some through that filter you know you

875
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,850
don't let it set and guess and do that

876
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,859
whole job but you need to just

877
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:21,080
double-check that so that's one thing I

878
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,150
think you can do pre-interview you'd be

879
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,830
really surprised at how many times

880
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:27,590
things are breaking down during the

881
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,719
interview process and I think they like

882
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,090
st. what too many cooks spoil it another

883
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,439
something like that anyway you got to

884
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,050
think about your process does your

885
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,810
process include an OB absolutely

886
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,550
essential decision makers and does

887
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,299
everybody in there need to be in there

888
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,440
there's a hiring manager you

889
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:46,399
hundred percent sure everybody's on the

890
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,559
same page

891
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,118
have you had everybody all in a all in

892
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,849
the room together discussing what you're

893
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,769
looking for during that period process

894
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:56,929
you need to be looking in do does each

895
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:59,209
person under actually understand their

896
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,980
job what what should they be do it do

897
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:03,349
they know specifically what they're

898
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,029
looking for are there questions fit for

899
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:07,339
purpose you know do we know what they're

900
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:09,650
going to be asking people in we sure

901
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:11,839
those questions actually screen for the

902
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,910
right thing and I think one great way of

903
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,950
doing if ultimately this person is going

904
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,569
to report in to you I think it's really

905
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,299
important to sit in those other

906
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:22,339
interviews might be missed range not so

907
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:24,170
much probably for it haneda but for the

908
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:25,970
other interviewer but you should sit in

909
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,559
and just see what they're asking and

910
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,750
then you'll know what people duplicating

911
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:31,400
areas things not being covered as

912
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,609
somebody looking for something that was

913
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,740
a part what you really wanted so to make

914
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:38,569
sure that you do see in and you've

915
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,118
experienced the interview process

916
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:43,490
yourself hopefully by now you've found

917
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,529
them you've got to your office stage and

918
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,439
this is when everything you learned

919
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:52,579
during that retention period comes into

920
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,559
practice this is when ideally the things

921
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:58,069
that set you apart in your ability to

922
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:00,200
retain your staff other things that we

923
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:02,240
able to use and set itself apart in your

924
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,680
ability to attract staff what you want

925
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,508
to do is make sure that you truly

926
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,848
understand why people in in their

927
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:09,319
current company or what they if they

928
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:12,289
already left them what they didn't like

929
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:14,390
what specifically they're looking for

930
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:16,369
and you want to make sure that you sell

931
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,819
to those voids you know you sell the

932
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:22,759
business you sell you as a as a manager

933
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:24,650
or a colleague sell to the things that

934
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:27,049
they're specifically looking for and

935
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,240
this is going to hugely help you close

936
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:31,038
somebody very quickly ideally hopefully

937
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,808
before they yeah they go to all these

938
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,230
other interviews but the chances are now

939
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:39,289
most people will get multiple offers and

940
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:41,960
you're kind of almost giving them the

941
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:44,420
confidence that you're gonna get exactly

942
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,829
what they were missed and that's going

943
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,630
to be very hard for other companies and

944
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,970
if you know that against your

945
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,190
competitors locally there's things that

946
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,919
you do really well that they don't do

947
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,450
very well because that'd be an example

948
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,940
the way I would look

949
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:00,589
so let's say that I know you mentioned

950
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,720
spending more time with your family was

951
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,730
a reason why you were looking to leave

952
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,950
your parent company just you know this

953
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:09,320
much PTI we give and this is how

954
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,899
flexible we are about working and

955
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:15,650
working from home and we know they now

956
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:19,610
industry in this location really very

957
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:21,200
very unique too so make sure you aim to

958
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:24,590
do that that's going to help you close

959
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,220
people and then the 81 most important

960
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:31,910
thing is you must live our promise you

961
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,169
can't off star and them again you know

962
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,970
then let them end up with over

963
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:38,420
completely different really different

964
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:40,040
job or different set of options to what

965
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,450
they signed up for because if you do

966
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,460
that trust me

967
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:45,649
the community will find out about it

968
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,870
it's not a good place to be the last

969
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,670
part of recruitment we're going to look

970
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,170
at all of the different parts within

971
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,520
recruit when you look at some actions

972
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,340
that you should be putting is a place

973
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,460
the quality of your job description is

974
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:00,440
first thing you do and it I'm a believer

975
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,020
that is the most important thing you do

976
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,670
get that right and you will be able to

977
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,310
attract the right people and you'll know

978
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,960
where you can have flexibility and where

979
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:11,779
you can make sure you've got a specific

980
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,360
hiring plan if you're gonna you know and

981
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,580
whether that's I'm going to go internal

982
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:18,500
I've got button to go external or I'm

983
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,060
going to hire somebody in or I'm going

984
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,130
to hire and train or I'm just going to

985
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,630
Train somebody internally make sure you

986
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,270
know what you plan to do for that

987
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:28,400
position and can you go back and change

988
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,960
that budget cap but sent out make sure

989
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,610
you've got a plan and works with it and

990
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,420
if you're going to go down the external

991
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:36,860
search make sure or qualifying everybody

992
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,300
that's involved in that whether when we

993
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,980
talk about external search that can

994
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,740
still be your internal recruitment team

995
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,060
or it could be an external agency make

996
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:47,209
sure that you know what they're doing

997
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,950
make sure that they understand exactly

998
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,440
what you're looking for and then you

999
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,750
have confidence that they're good they

1000
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,240
can find the people for you reality

1001
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,620
check once you've started seeing

1002
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,779
candidates you can have a real reality

1003
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,620
check as to how good is your job

1004
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,510
description

1005
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,750
are we getting most of what we need to

1006
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:08,480
do and if you're not go back to job

1007
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,990
description or look at assessing your

1008
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,420
recruitment process

1009
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,830
you can use your retention information

1010
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,990
that's why we do this retention stuff

1011
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,790
but making sure you use your retention

1012
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:20,520
information throughout the recruitment

1013
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:22,170
process to make sure that you your

1014
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,960
encouragingly would statement in the

1015
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,430
process and then also to close it so

1016
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,710
sell to your candidates actual

1017
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,810
requirements don't sell generally about

1018
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,670
what your company in do sell to what the

1019
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:35,000
candidates specifically looking for and

1020
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:38,430
then when they're on what you promised

1021
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,080
always that's that's one of the most

1022
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,419
horrible things we sometimes see in this

1023
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,880
industry people that join companies and

1024
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:48,570
they're looking immediately afterwards

1025
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:54,030
you must deliver you promise so I think

1026
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:56,400
that's me done and despite my problems

1027
00:39:54,030 --> 00:40:00,119
hopefully the rest of this seems to have

1028
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,300
gone a bit cooler and I you're more than

1029
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,650
welcome to follow me on Twitter and drop

1030
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,230
me messages on there I've got to say I

1031
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,670
don't really use it that religiously

1032
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,160
you're probably much better to connect

1033
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:14,940
with me on LinkedIn and of course if you

1034
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:17,730
family environment then mention it in

1035
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,350
the know again awful lot of and then

1036
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,690
what how many I'm up to you now but I

1037
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,850
get an awful lot of LinkedIn requests

1038
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:26,340
and I'm quite brutal I don't accept

1039
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:28,589
everybody and that's just because I want

1040
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:32,520
to I want to stop myself get so many

1041
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:33,900
sales so many sales messages but also on

1042
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,880
and connect with people that I think I

1043
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,619
would be useful for and they would be

1044
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,180
used for so make sure you put in

1045
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,680
anything that you do connect with me

1046
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,540
just make sure that you know it's

1047
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,430
through this of course if you work in a

1048
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,700
cybersecurity chance such about you

1049
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,700
anyway
