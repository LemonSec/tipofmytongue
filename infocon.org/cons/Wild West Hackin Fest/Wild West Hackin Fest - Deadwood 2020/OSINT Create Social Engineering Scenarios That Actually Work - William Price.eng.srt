1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,740
to the power of computing I compel you

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,510
pretty excited about your presentation I

3
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:12,590
think this is the this is something

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,320
that's kind of near and dear to my heart

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,270
I've tied to the presentation I gave at

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,610
RSA about my mom breaking into a prison

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,390
and I really believe that a lot of

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,310
social engineering attacks are extremely

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,780
stale they're doing the exact same thing

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,369
again and again and again so we were

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,289
excited whenever we read your

12
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,520
presentation right up it sounded like it

13
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,739
was gonna bring in some really cool

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,110
dynamic approaches to trying to handle

15
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:39,828
social engineering so with that sir

16
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:42,790
please take it away well first of all

17
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:45,559
nice to be here so we want to talk about

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,260
social engineering and using open source

19
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,089
intelligence sounds complicated but it's

20
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,820
actually not so that's what we're gonna

21
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:56,030
talk about today because when you look

22
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,820
at attacks phishing is social

23
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,890
engineering it's becoming so much more

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,780
common I mean that's become an important

25
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,968
part of us when we do a test of an

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,530
organization we're really pushing social

27
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:08,780
engineering tests to test your employees

28
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,139
to get them used to this Who am I I'm

29
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,920
William I am the founder CEO leader of

30
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:17,719
cyber X we are a cyber security firm in

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,119
Charlotte and we focus on helping small

32
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,189
and mid-sized organizations and I kind

33
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,049
of got started for me I'd been doing pin

34
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:26,389
test for some pretty large organizations

35
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,249
you see you get it into these

36
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:31,189
organizations easily you break in and

37
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:33,649
then about the same time a friend of

38
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:35,298
mine at a small business got compromised

39
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:37,700
and we saw the damage it did to them and

40
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,779
then we started sort of thinking you

41
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,759
know we're working with larger

42
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:42,859
organizations they have tremendous

43
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,020
budgets to tremendous team some of them

44
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:47,719
for security and they have these

45
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,699
mistakes that are costing them so dearly

46
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,109
what about the small and midsize market

47
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,579
these organizations don't have the

48
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:54,169
budget they don't have the manpower and

49
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,208
we started focused on helping those

50
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:57,829
organizations build security programs

51
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:01,130
within their budgets and within their

52
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,669
manpower first of all what is social

53
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,208
engineering

54
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:07,908
there's several definitions but I like

55
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:09,649
this one the best if any act that when

56
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:11,870
do you convince someone to take an

57
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,880
action that might might not be in their

58
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,580
best interest and the social engineering

59
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,190
part is

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,110
convincing right I can convince someone

61
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,240
to do something good but helps them

62
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,510
something bad that's not in their best

63
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,830
interest and they don't know it

64
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,440
before I get too far into this I want to

65
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,630
tell a little story social engineering

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,609
had not always been one of our

67
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,230
specialties when we do tests say within

68
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,090
the last year's when we really started

69
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,649
focusing and finding some patterns for

70
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,170
creating social engineering that got us

71
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,970
a huge success I think over the last few

72
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,070
tests were done with social engineering

73
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,260
testing organizations we've got like a

74
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,120
40 to 50 percent click great and we got

75
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,100
credentials for these organizations

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,490
every single test we've done at least

77
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,900
one users credentials so a recent test

78
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,000
sort of exemplifies everything that

79
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,600
we're going to talk about so this was an

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,230
organization they they handle it back in

81
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,000
payment processing for banks they sort

82
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,320
of like an MSP for banks from what I

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,920
could tell they soon have done a lot of

84
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,590
things

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,540
so part of what all they did do but

86
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,820
they're dealing with top fortune 10

87
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,440
companies huge companies that they have

88
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,040
contracts with and they're doing this

89
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,840
back in processing and they had several

90
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,850
thousand employees but only 50 were in

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,030
scope for social engineering sort of a

92
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,709
bummer but we said all right fine and we

93
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,239
like to experiment when we're doing on

94
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,340
these engagements of course in our labs

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,700
- and we've been testing out a new

96
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,760
method for creating these phishing sites

97
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,920
so historically you use something like

98
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,899
HTT track that's the toolkit to clone

99
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,640
the website right and we were playing

100
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,160
around some other methods so we were

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,950
testing using WordPress sites we use a

102
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,280
host and we spin up the cPanel and then

103
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:56,518
we pre-built all of these websites the

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,830
that we use frequently so we'll buy it

105
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,530
we have a bunch of domains we don't so

106
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,959
like for example there's a this is not

107
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,840
the Dominion let's say we only log in

108
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,730
Ericom so then we can spin up a steep

109
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,010
panel and then to the organization we're

110
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,440
going to target I can go alright Walmart

111
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,310
dot blog and Ericom and then I can

112
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,959
create a phishing page for them

113
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,700
and I just treat this site once and then

114
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,910
I just cloned it into whatever URL I

115
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,260
want and I spin it up on a cPanel

116
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,910
because I don't want it on this the

117
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,139
hosting that we use for a website or I

118
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,389
examine want to get blacklisted

119
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:32,240
of course I've checked with organization

120
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,919
they're fine with us doing this and this

121
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,690
is the first test that we had done that

122
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,289
we were actually using this method on a

123
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:42,020
live test and we accidentally click to

124
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,030
set up an SPF record so then later we

125
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,820
wanted to make these sites as legit as

126
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:50,539
possible so of course we set up DKMS PFE

127
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,380
mark for our domains we use CloudFlare a

128
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,630
you guys probably are familiar

129
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,850
CloudFlare we put the domain behind an

130
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,050
SSL so the user goes to it whatever what

131
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,870
have we and the security told them in

132
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,130
the past look for that green shield up

133
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,510
on the top right that's what we told

134
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,860
them so they they know they're well

135
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,610
trained they look for that green shield

136
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,090
we've got it

137
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,250
so the SPF had been misconfigure when we

138
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,770
started our first phishing emails we

139
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,919
were just using I'm an old 365 account

140
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,690
that we used for this they were all

141
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,159
getting rejected and we cannot figure

142
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,120
out for anything why these emails are

143
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,600
not getting through this will always

144
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,080
work for us and the security of the

145
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
system

146
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,760
we've been messing with him trying to

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,229
figure out initially he said yeah it's

148
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,849
getting past our security others are not

149
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,900
the issue we want to test our users will

150
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,700
go ahead and whitelist your emails

151
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,799
somehow he had a change of heart

152
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,840
mid engagement he said that if you're

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,010
legit pentesters you should be able to

154
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,460
get your emails through I said alright

155
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,630
so now we have a challenge right we're

156
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,210
gonna get our emails through and show

157
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:50,690
this guy that were legit so that we did

158
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:53,060
we end up finding the SPF issue and we

159
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,979
did a ton of OSINT we looked at Twitter

160
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,320
accounts we looked at a company website

161
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,479
we looked at their Facebook account of

162
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,130
the company who followed it we looked at

163
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,390
the employees and then we started

164
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,020
looking at their personal lives where

165
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,520
they were going

166
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,190
what kind of concerts that they've been

167
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,990
going to and building out a dossier I

168
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,660
guess you could call it of each employee

169
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,580
who was in scope the kind of things they

170
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,010
like and we want as much information as

171
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,840
we can I want to know what kind of food

172
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,789
you like what restaurants do you go to

173
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,409
every other week what kind of pets do

174
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:23,810
you have do you have an affinity towards

175
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,520
German Shepherds for example of course

176
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,440
we'll talk more about each of these but

177
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,260
this is the kind of information we we

178
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,120
want about them so for this particular

179
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,370
engineering the Spearfish we sent but

180
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,100
goddess in we have found that the

181
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,990
company had been endorsed by I won't say

182
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,270
what state they're in but this that

183
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,400
states banking board they had been

184
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,770
endorsed for their excellence and they

185
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,440
had posted this on their news on their

186
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,630
website so we took this information we

187
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,150
did a little research some of the

188
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,680
newspapers big newspapers so that would

189
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,560
have announcements about this kind of

190
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,500
information and then we sent them a fake

191
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,670
email saying that we were with The Wall

192
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,410
Street Journal and we had seen the

193
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,940
announcement and we thought it was great

194
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,860
and we wanted to just put a little

195
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,080
section in on the side column of the

196
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,100
article and we needed it wanted to know

197
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,620
if they could answer a few questions

198
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,690
they said sure we've told during our

199
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,190
research we found the secure mail portal

200
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,390
they were using and we went to that page

201
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,690
and we saw what it looked like when he

202
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:23,360
logged in so we set up a fake portal

203
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,450
just like theirs once we got permission

204
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,610
from some of the higher-ups the c-more

205
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,120
senior executives vice-president to the

206
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,810
company

207
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,070
yes we're interested in this talk to

208
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,630
disperse in that person of course this

209
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:40,040
person that person was not in our scope

210
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:42,680
of the 15 scope so then we sent them an

211
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,510
email looking like we were the CEO and

212
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,250
we sent this to a couple of the vice

213
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,950
presidents the vice president compliance

214
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,870
the vice president marketing saying that

215
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,539
we want it to be wanted them to be

216
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,180
featured in its article of course they

217
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,000
were excited they clicked the link they

218
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,490
logged in and there was a payload at

219
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,530
document quick tip used Dropbox for your

220
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,270
payload at documents you can change that

221
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,190
equals zero at the end of the oriole to

222
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,349
an equal one it'll all of auto download

223
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,030
because Dropbox does not scan your files

224
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,590
like Google Drive or some of the others

225
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,479
does and of course there's other ways

226
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,669
but that's what we were using then and

227
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,870
but Dropbox was blocked that their

228
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,800
firewall their company wasn't allowed to

229
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,900
use Dropbox so the employee decided that

230
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,780
this was the vice-president compliance

231
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,729
he decided to do it on his mobile phone

232
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,609
he logged into the portal we got his

233
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,570
credentials problem was he missed typing

234
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,419
on his phone and gave us the wrong

235
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,490
credentials so then we had to respond

236
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,049
back great we got your answers

237
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,760
we had it one more question you mind

238
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,559
filling that out he logged back in with

239
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,208
their correct credentials so we got the

240
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,459
vice-president compliance the

241
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:49,069
president of marketing did it and before

242
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:52,008
we targeted her again this is a quick

243
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:53,599
tip we looked her up on LinkedIn the and

244
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,189
YouTube and we looked for all the videos

245
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,959
and we're looking for the kind of words

246
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:59,868
this person uses the phrases they use

247
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,989
and then we tailor our message to be

248
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:05,480
just like them right because people like

249
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,009
things that like them we like people who

250
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,860
are like us we like people who like the

251
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:11,240
same things we like so we went and we

252
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,889
spent cotton looking at videos of this

253
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,470
person kind of words they use the

254
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:17,839
phrases they use and then we word at our

255
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,339
email to be just like it so now we've

256
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,529
got credentials we will log in in this

257
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,459
true FA in place so now the next

258
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,420
challenge is how to get around

259
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:28,309
two-factor authentication so I didn't

260
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,469
wanna do anything this thing so we

261
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:32,809
waited till the next day again another

262
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,059
phishing email to the person compliance

263
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:36,949
who he got his credentials I called up

264
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:39,290
the company I acted like uh somebody

265
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:40,670
else I was trying to get get to his desk

266
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,860
it wasn't answering could I give me his

267
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,649
mobile number got his mobile number I'm

268
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,850
just using spoof car I don't know if you

269
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,980
guys are familiar with smooth car you

270
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,569
can spook your phone number could look

271
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,059
like whatever number you want we just

272
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:55,639
use that we got his mobile number then I

273
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:58,459
spoofed my number to look like I was the

274
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,589
ACE one of the security analysts at a

275
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:02,299
different branch when we're interacting

276
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:04,220
like this we try to get someone outside

277
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:06,350
of the department this person interacts

278
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,360
with we try if we can to be at a

279
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,829
different branch hopefully this is not

280
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,999
some of this person talks you that all

281
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:14,628
the time to know what their voice is

282
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:16,879
like so we called him up we said that we

283
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:20,029
had been working on a back-end Active

284
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,699
Directory both 465 sync up great portal

285
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,230
upgrade they had gone south we were

286
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:26,628
having issues users were getting locked

287
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,819
out of course we did a name drop but we

288
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,619
just were able to stop so and so if

289
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:32,059
we're getting locked out I wanna it

290
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:33,559
looks like yours is not locked out yet

291
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:36,199
but you're going to be locked out we

292
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,549
wanted to see if we could save you we

293
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:39,618
don't want you to lose time in the day

294
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,389
again so what we're doing we're making

295
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,839
ourselves look like we know what we're

296
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,040
talking about

297
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,740
we know someone in the company we're

298
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,420
name-dropping and we're being helpful to

299
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,209
him so what does he have to lose we're

300
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,439
helping him right he says sure what do

301
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:53,089
you need I said we're gonna send you an

302
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:55,069
authentication code to get you logged

303
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,209
back in I just need you to read that to

304
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:59,429
me and then we'll

305
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:02,128
that and you should be good to go the

306
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:04,050
user was suspicious first they said they

307
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:06,480
wanted to verify who we were they asked

308
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,859
for our last name where we were why were

309
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
using a different phone number of course

310
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,519
I pre thought about some of the

311
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,860
questions you might ask I had reasons

312
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,089
I'm on vacation try to get a little

313
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,579
sympathy other than I said I'm on

314
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,050
vacation because of how bad this was I'm

315
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,888
actually they've called me back and I'm

316
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:24,300
helping them do this that satisfied him

317
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,679
they go on proceeded to say yeah they

318
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,329
got me on the social engineering last

319
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,759
year so I wanted to verify this year

320
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,559
before I gave anything out but he was

321
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,879
doing it again and he gave us this 2fa

322
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,040
code and we were into his accountant

323
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,809
from there we were able to send emails

324
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,480
from his accountant pivot into other

325
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:41,459
accounts a lot in that little story and

326
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,649
that's what we're gonna start talking

327
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:47,670
about now is how we were able to find

328
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:50,369
that information in how we built that so

329
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,219
why social engineering we see the news

330
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:55,769
and it's obvious that social engineering

331
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,730
attacks are on the rise it seems like

332
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,470
every time we turn around there's

333
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,689
another incident another huge data

334
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,929
breach in social engineering is involved

335
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:06,569
systems themselves are getting tougher

336
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:09,509
to attack they're still possible to

337
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:11,639
attack of course but it's if not easy as

338
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,649
to say it was 15-20 years ago not that I

339
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,640
was testing on that long ago but I do

340
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,740
have friends

341
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,590
the humans are the weakest element and

342
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,540
it's easier to target humans I've talked

343
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,590
about this with a few people but there's

344
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,959
different opinions around this

345
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,030
everyone's entitled to his own but I

346
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,820
also think a sort of fundamental shift

347
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,880
in how we design our organizations has

348
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,830
added to the propensity of users to fall

349
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,040
for phishing attacks I mean if you think

350
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:42,280
about 15 years ago maybe longer a remote

351
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,410
worker or an employee on not on site

352
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,430
needs to get access to a file what do

353
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,829
they have to do they have to connect to

354
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,750
a VPN this might require a certificate

355
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,700
of some sort they have to connect to it

356
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,920
and authenticate and then they can get

357
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,110
to the final server right be that the

358
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,810
mail server or whatever it was it was

359
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,850
much more challenging there was more

360
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,229
technological steps now you want to get

361
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,490
to the files what do they do

362
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,640
of course it's not every organization

363
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,590
but a lot you go to your L 365 portal

364
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,510
you log in you go to your Dropbox portal

365
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,240
you log in you go to sheriff I log in

366
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:17,740
users are much more used to just logging

367
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,900
in it's not as different as it was 15-20

368
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,020
years ago my sort of opinion is that

369
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:25,300
this is having it's not the culprit

370
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,810
but our shift to the cloud is adding to

371
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,870
users likelihood to just log in

372
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:34,599
somewhere another issue we have I'm sure

373
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,850
all of us feel overworked we're all

374
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,370
working over 40 hours a week and because

375
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,930
of this we're in a rush

376
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,100
many workers they're in a rush they're

377
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,660
trying to get through their jobs they

378
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,940
have this to do this to do someone comes

379
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,219
in they ask them to do something else

380
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,050
that wasn't on their to-do list for the

381
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:54,400
day now they don't know how they're

382
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:56,170
gonna finish and in 2017 it's a an

383
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,329
organization did some research they did

384
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,589
some surveys and they found that 70% of

385
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,600
workers in the United States felt

386
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,480
overworked now when you think about this

387
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,790
if I'm overworked I'm trying to rush

388
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,400
through my tasks I take less time and

389
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,620
I'm less cautious right I'm just trying

390
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,620
to get things done it happens to all of

391
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,300
us even if we're trained we get in a

392
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,370
hurry I'm looking at something on my

393
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,199
phone I'm walking down the road looking

394
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,940
at emails and I'm trying to get stuff

395
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,730
done we're sitting on the bus wherever

396
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,380
we are and that adds to why phishing

397
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,620
attacks have become so much more

398
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,080
successful another issue that I think is

399
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,960
sort of a core issue is this the innate

400
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,400
human tendency to trust and to be

401
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,740
helpful we're trained from an early age

402
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,120
to trust people we trust Authority we

403
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,820
trust our parents I'm not saying this is

404
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,010
wrong it's actually very right we should

405
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,900
trust and we want to help people we're

406
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,839
taught to be kind we're talking manners

407
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,150
to be helpful even if the bad guys even

408
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,880
if that's the hacker targeting

409
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,500
organization even if that's the attacker

410
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,839
trying to get our to FA code we're

411
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,459
trying to be helpful right I mean if you

412
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,160
think about what are we taught someone

413
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:05,890
opens a door for you say thanks this

414
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,329
that could get really psychological Nick

415
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,970
Espinoza did a talk we talked about

416
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,700
cognitive trust where we develop biases

417
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:15,610
we do something so many times it becomes

418
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,140
normal to us and we don't see what can

419
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,540
be wrong with it and that's another

420
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,600
issue that is making social engineering

421
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,959
more successful

422
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,449
as of June 2019 the best numbers I could

423
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,268
get is there a three billion fake emails

424
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:31,859
in a day pretty staggering number and

425
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:33,810
according to know before some people

426
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,670
disagree with this statistic I cannot

427
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,829
find where they got the numbers from but

428
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,680
it's interesting that they say presently

429
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:43,680
only 3% of malware exploits strictly a

430
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,569
technical flaw in 97 percent target's

431
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,910
users in some capacity it asks them to

432
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,769
do something it might be skewed a little

433
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,170
bit but I think it's close to the

434
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:54,810
correct number users again that they're

435
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,300
the easiest way into a system when we

436
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:59,008
talk about layered security and wherever

437
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,329
you put them some organizations say

438
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,800
humans are first some people say be

439
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:03,779
human it should last something so that

440
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,000
unions shouldn't be a layer like it or

441
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,860
not humans are a layer in our security

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,720
controls and that we have to account for

443
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,339
so let's look at some of the social

444
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,310
engineering status cause data breaches

445
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,860
and these are just a few you remember

446
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,119
the John Podesta email the DNC hack out

447
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,060
of it all start that started with a

448
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,730
phishing email he got an email in Gmail

449
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:27,149
someone has your password there was

450
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,560
literally a miscommunication or whoever

451
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,350
was doing his emails maybe I was an

452
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,119
assistant base forward it to the IT team

453
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,589
and IT team said this has to have said

454
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,170
this is illegitimate I actually said

455
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,360
it's legitimate and he logged in the

456
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,040
attackers had his credentials one thing

457
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,439
when we talked about this one thing we

458
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,730
know is have standard processes and

459
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:46,680
procedures in place that can help with a

460
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:50,009
lot of social engineering maybe not this

461
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,930
one but if you have standard procedures

462
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,610
all right you believe you have a

463
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,670
phishing email this is the standard

464
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,459
procedures to take know before say has

465
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,469
the fish alert maybe that's how you do

466
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:04,079
it maybe you for the email to a certain

467
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,240
person but having those processes

468
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,789
standard process in place can cut down

469
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,000
on some of the users falling for them or

470
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:14,459
in this case miscommunications in the

471
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,369
Sony hack that was 2014 where the

472
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:19,650
allegedly North Korean hackers there's

473
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:22,289
some debate around who it was anyhow

474
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,480
whoever did it the attack started off

475
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:26,459
with spear phishing emails they were

476
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,130
able to gain access to the networks they

477
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,950
stole data employee data sensitive

478
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,570
emails employee salaries all kinds of

479
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,260
information they made public and then

480
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,269
they use a wiper malware and white

481
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,889
a bunch of computers but how did that

482
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:41,529
all start it started with spear phishing

483
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:41,830
emails just Reese with in the last few

484
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,840
months

485
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,549
the Greenville South Carolina which is

486
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,250
not very far from where I am a cyber

487
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:50,470
attack caused by an employee clicking

488
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,200
phishing email fortunately Greenville

489
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,250
was able to contain this very quickly

490
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,409
because they had planned for this kind

491
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,779
of attack but again this is another line

492
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,639
we're seeing with phishing being the

493
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:03,309
cause of a breach within the last couple

494
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:05,379
months number was the u.s. gas pipeline

495
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:08,860
operator where operations were halted

496
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,000
for a couple days in that that rent

497
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,590
somewhere attack if you look at the

498
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,529
articles and again that one started with

499
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,959
phishing emails so we have to train our

500
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:18,700
employees in phishing is not something

501
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,320
that we can in or we can't ignore the

502
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,710
employee the human factor of our

503
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,149
security controls so now we're gonna

504
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,100
sort of switch and we're gonna start

505
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:29,768
talking about performing these attacks

506
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,350
whenever we perform a social engineering

507
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:35,380
attack or engagement test whatever

508
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,070
there's a pretty standard life cycle

509
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,019
that we follow

510
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,309
of course we start with information

511
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:41,080
gathering you're probably all familiar

512
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:43,120
with the phases of penetration testing

513
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,309
we start with reconnaissance right I

514
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,039
want to know as much information as I

515
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:49,330
can about my target if you look at

516
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,820
intelligence if you look at government

517
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,799
intelligence what are they doing most of

518
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,840
time they're trying to find information

519
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,639
about their targets they want to know as

520
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,928
much as I can about these people on the

521
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:01,120
same way when we're on engagement I

522
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,399
wanna know everything I can I'm looking

523
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,620
for your children why don't want to know

524
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:07,090
who your children are well it's not

525
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,549
uncommon for people use their children's

526
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:12,220
name and a password I want to know what

527
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,929
teams you like other local teams that

528
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,549
you're following but our local teams you

529
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,190
root for who do you like it the Super

530
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:20,139
Bowl what kind of foods do you like the

531
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,330
better of a picture I can build about

532
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:24,519
each person and this takes time so it's

533
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,340
a tedious process but the more I know

534
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,440
about the individual the more tailored

535
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,689
my attack can be and the more likely I

536
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,419
am to succeed there's many ways to do

537
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,730
this but we typically use drawn a blank

538
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:38,110
no keeping tool for pen tests and we

539
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,240
just create a tab inside of there for

540
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,340
each individual and as we go through we

541
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,529
create sub tabs Twitter and we start in

542
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,168
their career URL who they're following

543
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:49,130
the kinds of tweets they like the kinds

544
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:50,270
of tweaks that they respond to is

545
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,210
much information as we can about that

546
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,280
then we go to LinkedIn their profile and

547
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,630
we start building out the company who's

548
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,070
following the company a lot of times

549
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,320
employees follow their companies we're

550
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:03,129
looking for that as much information is

551
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,330
okay nothing is too trivial many times

552
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,370
something doesn't seem like important a

553
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,590
bit about this person but we go and add

554
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,909
it and then later when we're trying to

555
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,199
attack this person you have that piece

556
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,230
of information comes up and it's useful

557
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,520
then after we've done our information

558
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,160
gathering we move on to building a

559
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,850
relationship with the individual and

560
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,990
depending on what kind of social

561
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,199
engineering you're doing be this

562
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,870
physical email phishing over the phone

563
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,000
if you're texting build a relationship

564
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,719
with the individual then this could be

565
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,610
physical maybe it's making eye contact

566
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,250
smiling at the person saying hi being

567
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,830
friendly if it's an email if we're going

568
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,440
fishing spearfishing we typically try to

569
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,120
never have our ask thing we want the

570
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,270
ability to be our first interaction with

571
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,760
them we try to have a conversation that

572
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,040
leads into the action the best we can

573
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,230
because they're more likely to do it

574
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,629
without it standing out to them if this

575
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,270
is on the phone I don't call them up and

576
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,100
ask one single question I asked a bunch

577
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,680
of benign questions that are harmless

578
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,419
right and then I throw in what I really

579
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,830
want to know somewhere in there and I

580
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,060
don't have that be my last either

581
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,800
because I don't want that to be the last

582
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,200
thing that remember me ask so on an

583
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,820
engagement we did and we were talking in

584
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,070
targeting an individual we want to know

585
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,379
what kind of antivirus they had so we

586
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:21,139
called him up how do we had a ruse of

587
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,510
course we asked a bunch of questions and

588
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,250
then we're trying to we were allegedly

589
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,040
troubleshooting some connection issues

590
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,840
and we had in the course the

591
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,820
conversation we had them right click on

592
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,189
their tray at the bottom tell us what

593
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,050
kind of antibodies they had the version

594
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:39,170
it was etc and then we had that

595
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:41,629
information but like I said before this

596
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:44,000
is never the first question we ask we

597
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,890
always want the what we want them to do

598
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,500
we that click a link open a malicious

599
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,580
document we want it to one be something

600
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,560
that would be part of their job

601
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,090
something they would do on a daily basis

602
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,010
and this would not stand out in the

603
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,300
least bit and we don't want it to be the

604
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,710
first or the last thing we ask because

605
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,940
we want it to be

606
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,320
another part of the conversation that

607
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,720
doesn't stand out and this is what the

608
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,689
attackers are doing to the next phase is

609
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,460
of course exploitation that is all right

610
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,690
in my previous example that is the phone

611
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,970
call where I ask and get that

612
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,620
information from the individual that

613
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,090
might be the phishing conversation where

614
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,310
we go back and forth and then I ask them

615
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,169
to do something then we gather the

616
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,639
information and depending on what you're

617
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,860
doing if this is part of a larger

618
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,720
engagement I'm set up ten tests maybe

619
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,969
you use this information for something

620
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,270
else and that's the execution phase many

621
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,410
times if we run a just a strict social

622
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,180
engineering engagement we don't move

623
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,540
past the exploitation but that's how the

624
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,460
life cycle works so let's forget about

625
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,100
some of the tips on how to be successful

626
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,110
at social engineering something that you

627
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,230
have to understand is and again this

628
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:48,090
could be a psychological thing I'm not

629
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,560
gonna get into the psychology of it I'm

630
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,780
just talking from observation here

631
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,760
people respond one of two ways to

632
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,139
something they respond logically and

633
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,690
they think about it or they respond out

634
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,370
of emotion and if I can get a person to

635
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,140
respond out of emotion they're not gonna

636
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,330
take logical steps and they're gonna do

637
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,160
things that are quite stupid or flat

638
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,350
detrimental for their organization so

639
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,510
creating an emotion is a very powerful

640
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,129
part of a social engineering engagement

641
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,920
now some of the emotions that I can

642
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,500
create our fear I send an email to your

643
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,540
company email you had jury duty you

644
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,250
didn't show up you're gonna be fine

645
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,020
and there's some kind of link that have

646
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,030
them take some action person becomes

647
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,310
afraid and they don't think right they

648
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,720
proceed and they click the link

649
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,970
excitement if I can get the person happy

650
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,890
excited about something a scenario we've

651
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,990
used a couple times at different

652
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,000
organizations and because we felt like

653
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,650
it was would fit and this works good at

654
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,610
the end of the year a lot of times the

655
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:43,200
scenario we target in the one instance

656
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,510
we talk to the development team who

657
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,360
developed some of this internal software

658
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,759
that was company used we pretended to be

659
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,468
the CEO

660
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,749
we talked about we had had such a good

661
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:57,809
year the company had such a good year

662
00:23:54,749 --> 00:24:00,719
and we knew that the development team

663
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:02,190
was integral to this success they were a

664
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:03,749
huge part of it and we just wanted to

665
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,139
reward them so we were giving away some

666
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:09,059
electronics ticket choosing iPhone or a

667
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:11,728
Android phone and we just needed them to

668
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:13,408
log into a certain sure point for her

669
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:15,409
and fill out a form and then we would

670
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:18,679
enter draw and some of them would win

671
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:18,679
they got excited

672
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:25,939
thority if i can pretend to be higher up

673
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:27,620
I'm gonna do it and a tip in my social

674
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,110
engine engagements we never try to be

675
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,820
the person's boss because this person

676
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,320
knows their boss they talk to him and

677
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,299
more than likely I can just get up out

678
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,210
of their chair and go ask them hey did

679
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:39,350
you tell me that want me to do this or

680
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,539
who knows it might come up in the next

681
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,219
morning's conversation I'm sorry I

682
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:44,600
didn't finish Project X because as I was

683
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,159
trying to work on projects why that he

684
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,158
told me to work on in the boss leg what

685
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,139
project why I didn't tell you to do that

686
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,809
so we try to tip little at least one

687
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:55,639
person over the boss's head someone that

688
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:57,678
the person likely does not interact with

689
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:59,689
all the time and where are we getting

690
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,549
this information from well I can go to

691
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,320
LinkedIn pretty much everyone's on

692
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:05,210
LinkedIn I can start looking at who's in

693
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,980
what organizations getting an idea of

694
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,649
maybe who's who's boss

695
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,120
sympathy another emotion so again when

696
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:12,979
I'm looking at doing my own

697
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,689
reconnaissance my own scent I'm looking

698
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,629
for what kind of things do you have an

699
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,549
affinity towards do I see you tweeting a

700
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:22,039
lot about supporting local animal

701
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:24,710
shelters do I see you supporting animal

702
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:27,860
rights baby rights who whatever it is

703
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,899
that I can draw sympathy from do I see

704
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,939
that you just really like Border Collies

705
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:33,918
and you've got four Border Collies and

706
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,240
they're always tweeting or putting on

707
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,519
Instagram pictures of your Border

708
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,960
Collies well maybe I call you up on the

709
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,519
phone and I have a dog barking in the

710
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,350
background and it's a border collie and

711
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,570
somewhere in the conversation I throw

712
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,580
that in that it's a oh I'm sorry that's

713
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,100
my border collie he'll be quiet getting

714
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,830
sympathy out of you getting you to be

715
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,809
sympathetic to a cause like that can be

716
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,389
another great Avenue to cause a motion

717
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:58,460
to get the person to not think

718
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,850
finally another one that works very well

719
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,250
ego stroking if I can create a scenario

720
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,080
that makes you feel important it's this

721
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,940
possible and it's likely that I can

722
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,230
trick you into doing what I want and

723
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,720
this works more for some people than

724
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,610
others um some people need their you'll

725
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,650
stroke more than others but again and

726
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,809
I'm not in the story I told I'm the one

727
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,600
individual after our engagement the

728
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:22,129
security team told us you really pick

729
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,469
the right person with that scenario

730
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,610
because this individual if you stroke

731
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,590
their ego they will do just about

732
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:31,219
anything without thinking at all

733
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:35,030
it's another emotion that can help

734
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,830
so like I talked about earlier when we

735
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,960
are working on social engineering

736
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,909
engagement the first step is to build

737
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,670
rapport with the individual like I said

738
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:46,130
we never start off our email with click

739
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,500
on this link to do X we always want to

740
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,210
build a relationship no matter how short

741
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,240
of relationship this is any relationship

742
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:55,250
works with the individual this is a

743
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,990
physical pen test physical social

744
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,850
engineering and tests maybe it's

745
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,110
physical injury I'm gonna meet in person

746
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,600
in the parking lot walking in

747
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,659
say hi to low mass color day is anything

748
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,860
to build rapport with the individual

749
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,610
start the conversation off with a joke

750
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,909
I'm sorry

751
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:12,409
whatever and another very very powerful

752
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,270
thing to keep in mind is the principle

753
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,800
of reciprocation if you think about how

754
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,240
we're taught from the time we're small

755
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,430
we're taught to reciprocate right

756
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,780
someone does something good for us what

757
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,670
do we do we say thank you

758
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,820
it's manners but people subconsciously

759
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:28,010
have this tendency you do something for

760
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,710
me I do something for you back I mean if

761
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,330
you look at politics and many companies

762
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,770
people are doing something nice for one

763
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,050
department because they want to the

764
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,610
favor returned right in my story I told

765
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:39,620
this was something we thought about

766
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,389
reciprocation I'm doing this guy favor

767
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,159
I'm gonna help him prevent him from

768
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,480
being locked out of his account so what

769
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,990
does he want to do if he wants to return

770
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,430
the favor

771
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,140
and do something to be helpful to me

772
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,270
alright and that's how we got his MFA

773
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,070
coat and into his account by the way

774
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,450
when we did get him if they code of

775
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,220
course we changed our own phone number

776
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,730
on the MFA so that we had persistent

777
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,590
access there thereafter

778
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,570
all right so some tips for actually

779
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,370
conducting the social engineering attack

780
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,918
and you're using Oh sent to do it

781
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:08,949
whatever your interaction is now this is

782
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,330
not a written in stone rule I've seen

783
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,860
some of the people at DEFCON they can

784
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,439
get tremendous amounts of information

785
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:16,479
out of a single target but we have found

786
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,130
that it works well to only have one or

787
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,840
two things my goal is to gather out of

788
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,690
this interaction but you start throwing

789
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,590
in too many asks too many questions try

790
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,720
and get the person to do too many things

791
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,189
for one you're gonna fail social

792
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,169
engineering is like marketing when you

793
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,429
have a call to action you have what you

794
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:33,730
want one thing that you want this

795
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:35,559
individual to did or if you do get them

796
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:39,039
succeed the other risky run is you're

797
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:40,570
going to alarm them and then another tip

798
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,580
is think about who you're dealing with

799
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,740
and what questions or objections are

800
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,820
they gonna have and I can't really run

801
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,679
through the snares in my head

802
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,809
run through a few questions they might

803
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,059
ask and I think about some answers

804
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:53,918
of course you have to be fluid you have

805
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:56,139
to cut a little things as you go but if

806
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,990
you have some scenario in your head

807
00:28:56,139 --> 00:29:00,850
before you start it's easier to do so so

808
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,130
again like the story I said scenario I

809
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,500
had in my head was I'm on vacation this

810
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,179
has gone bad and I'm being called in to

811
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,399
help so then when I'm on the phone with

812
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:11,769
them and the person asks where are you

813
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:13,539
but then I have a good explanation I'm

814
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:15,700
at a cabin in the mountains I'm on

815
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:18,460
vacation with my family but because this

816
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,929
happened I've come in to help I'm so

817
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,200
those are just a few tips for the actual

818
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:22,200
interaction

819
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,140
want to talk about the tools that we use

820
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,720
more performing open source intelligence

821
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,940
of course we start with search engines

822
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,980
and Google can give you a ton of

823
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,780
information if you're familiar with

824
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,340
google dorks a perfect way to get

825
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,190
information about a target we typically

826
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,250
always start art o centric on phase with

827
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:44,620
Google we're looking for emails but in

828
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,460
the domain app and so in this example at

829
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,439
whitehouse.gov

830
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,420
but it in quotes if you're familiar with

831
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,090
a quotes operator that tells it to

832
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,680
strictly search for something and you

833
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,120
can typically find penny on the size of

834
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,340
the organization some emails from them

835
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,479
so then there are pre operators that you

836
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,490
can put before whatever you're looking

837
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,680
for so you can search in text and that

838
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,350
search is in the text of webpages you

839
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:08,110
search in title in URL there's a bunch

840
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,300
of these that you can use there's a site

841
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,620
the Google dorks site that you go to and

842
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,149
they have thousands and thousands of

843
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,040
these people are constantly adding to

844
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,570
that you can go and check out then maybe

845
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,430
I'm looking I'm going to look at a

846
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,110
certain website and you put in the site

847
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,210
operator first so now I'm looking at on

848
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,860
the whitehouse.gov website I'm looking

849
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,930
for in the text I'm looking for at

850
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,699
whitehouse.gov typically you'll find a

851
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,740
couple pages where they have some kind

852
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,420
of contact information or maybe you

853
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,010
start using the file type operator

854
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,080
instead of in text and you start looking

855
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,360
in PDFs or in documents we found

856
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,340
sensitive information using this Google

857
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,219
dorks are a great way to start and then

858
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:44,800
so looking for subdomains of sites so

859
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:48,730
use the site operator of site Cisco comm

860
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,440
and now the - site is saying not the www

861
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,830
site so what you're gonna get back is a

862
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,200
list of subdomains for this organization

863
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:59,050
sometimes I get subdomains will look at

864
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,240
CRT Sh it's a certain repository of

865
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,919
certificates when you can start using

866
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,480
the data from their public certificates

867
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,120
to figure out what subdomains are having

868
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,070
or they're using or maybe at a depending

869
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,989
on the size organization on their site

870
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,120
maybe I'm looking for PDFs with

871
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:15,190
confidential in the title and we have

872
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,929
found confidential files publicly

873
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,940
accessible on the Internet using this

874
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,830
method so again there's tons and tons of

875
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,690
these google dorks that you can use am I

876
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:24,699
recommend you go check out the site what

877
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,080
we're looking for or its email addresses

878
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,240
sensitive confidential files

879
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,850
presentation files a lot of companies

880
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,830
present conferences we found

881
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,270
organizations sometimes they talk about

882
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,800
the system they are using in their

883
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,290
coughs and how they are

884
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,730
achieving a certain goal events events

885
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,200
are going to events they've recently

886
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,790
dawn - there's gonna be great

887
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,980
information for social engineering

888
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:47,260
maybe I send you an email we forgot to

889
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,030
have you sign X document at the event

890
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,280
you just recently went into I send them

891
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,600
the document assign and its payload

892
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,070
recognitions or awards they got again

893
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,320
that can be used for Eagle stroking

894
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:59,350
engagements we look for children's names

895
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,540
pets names calves dogs kind of pets they

896
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,459

899
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,149
lot of this information can be found

900
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,100
using social media people are becoming

901
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,930
more aware of the risk and they are

902
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,669
starting to lock their Facebook pages

903
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,140
down that only lets say their friends

904
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,340
can share this but a surprising number

905
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,250
of times you can still find this

906
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,290
information on Facebook again with on

907
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:25,180
search engines the Wayback Machine this

908
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:27,370
becomes very useful when you look at the

909
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,110
company's website go back in time or was

910
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,639
it a year ago five years ago if we're

911
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,500
looking at someone's Twitter page maybe

912
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,150
they've deleted a profile they deleted

913
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,740
something but sometimes you can find

914
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,380
that on the way back Time Machine if you

915
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,130
put in their URL Google News depending

916
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,350
on the size of the organization

917
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,480
sometimes you can find news recent

918
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,250
events about the organization and this

919
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,950
can be very useful useful to

920
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:50,080
subconsciously make the car 'get think

921
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,090
that you're an insider maybe you know

922
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,949
something that just happened they're not

923
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,780
thinking everybody knows this but you

924
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,370
throw that into a conversation and it

925
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,200
subconsciously makes them think that

926
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,699
you're an insider because you know X

927
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,480
event just happened in this company

928
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,190
email addresses like we talked about you

929
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,930
can just use the straight googled or the

930
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,030
harvester is a tool that works well

931
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:12,520
LinkedIn you can find sometimes

932
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:14,830
companies email addresses on LinkedIn

933
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,510
some people flat-out leave it public

934
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:18,100
some of them you have to connect to but

935
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:20,080
if you are logged into LinkedIn you can

936
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,330
use this link here and you can put in

937
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,370
what you think their email address is

938
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,449
sometimes it'll correct it for you and

939
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,760
they'll give you their actual email

940
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,200
address so that's something to try but

941
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,080
typically if you find one email address

942
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,970
usually they use a format be it first

943
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,949
initial dot last name first name dot

944
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,420
last name if you find one a lot of times

945
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,160
you can just guess what the others are

946
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,190
and then when we're looking for email

947
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,440
addresses we typically look at the do an

948
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,730
image tool box or an organization I just

949
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,650
picked a random organization that

950
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,100
somewhere in my vicinity then we try to

951
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,929
look at all right what kind of

952
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,059
email security do they have in place

953
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:55,580
what email provider are they using in

954
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:57,830
this case so using so false email social

955
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,750
media is a goldmine of information for

956
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,939
open source intelligence Instagram

957
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,980
people are constantly posting things on

958
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,659
Instagram so we're looking at what kind

959
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,279
of things are you liking what are your

960
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:08,899
comments would you come into it on who

961
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,129
are you following who's following you if

962
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,290
we can find these types of workplace

963
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:15,560
photos this is a great resource for us

964
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,940
I'm gonna try to if I can get the larger

965
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,279
version of this image start looking at

966
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,899
the software they're using and then when

967
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,060
I create social engineering spear

968
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:24,710
phishing email phone call I'm gonna

969
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,029
throw in some of this knowledge that I

970
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,379
now have that again makes them

971
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,010
subconsciously think I know what I'm

972
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,960
talking about

973
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:33,109
hey this is John I've got a quick

974
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:36,020
question I have to ask is that a sticky

975
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:38,210
note with a password on it this one was

976
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,940
not a password but yes we do look for

977
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:43,129
the okay because I think you literally

978
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,020
have a hundred and eighty five people

979
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:48,020
trying to enhance this picture to see

980
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:50,210
what a password is one that's great okay

981
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:55,609
I just pull this an example I have no

982
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:57,800
idea who these people is so it's right

983
00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:00,259
that one is not a password but sometimes

984
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,119
you do find that so again on this one on

985
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,710
this Instagram they they're excited to

986
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:06,200
be working at a company and they posted

987
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,520
a workstation picture no so what am I

988
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,500
gonna do I'm gonna look at their bottom

989
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,569
bar how I'm trying to figure out okay

990
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,849
what OS are you using what programs are

991
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:15,020
using what programs you have open I can

992
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:16,910
see obviously they like the San

993
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,680
Francisco 49ers and all of this

994
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,950
information starts going into my dossier

995
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,990
about this person to be used later all

996
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,029
right so again another workstation photo

997
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:28,368
on Instagram I have no idea what they're

998
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,380
talking about but what can I infer from

999
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:31,880
this all right first of all I see that

1000
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,589
there's no printer of this so they're

1001
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,349
probably using a central printer so

1002
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:38,960
maybe my fish becomes an email from the

1003
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:40,250
printer with a scanned document and then

1004
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,170
the person goes what I didn't scan a

1005
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,060
document I open and click it I see

1006
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:47,390
they're using some kind of VoIP phone so

1007
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,160
maybe it's an email of a voicemail we

1008
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,720
have to train the individuals or our

1009
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,859
organizations to be aware of the

1010
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,589
information they're releasing

1011
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:56,060
again badges never put your badges on

1012
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:58,460
tell your employees not for their badges

1013
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:01,099
on but if I'm on a physical engagement

1014
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,790
this is useful information for me and

1015
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:03,890
then just a couple

1016
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:06,140
tools that can be useful for IG story

1017
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,819
comm you can put in the person's handle

1018
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,830
and you can pull all of their stories

1019
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,840
that they've posted or again search my

1020
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,950
bio and you can put in that person and

1021
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,690
you can start getting bits of

1022
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:17,810
information pull it off of their profile

1023
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,370
next social media tool we always use is

1024
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,049
Twitter if it's a company I want to look

1025
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,370
at the company followers because a lot

1026
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:24,650
of times the followers of the company

1027
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,790
might be employees and I can start

1028
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,800
looking the employees what kind of

1029
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:30,200
things they are doing I'm so on one

1030
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,390
engagement we found a security analyst

1031
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,359
at this company the week before our

1032
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,890
engagement he had taken the osc P exam

1033
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,820
with offensive security and failed and

1034
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:41,060
he had posted on Twitter how

1035
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:44,330
disappointed he was so our fish becomes

1036
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,310
we realize you failed your test but we

1037
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:49,250
just realized we gave several students

1038
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:51,230
during X states the wrong environment we

1039
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,550
want to give you a free retake we're

1040
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,470
really apologize for what happened

1041
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:56,120
download this PDF fill out the form so

1042
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,589
that we can get this set up for you I'm

1043
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:01,609
just gonna say right now dude that's

1044
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:03,770
evil there's so so evil well that's what

1045
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:06,050
we're hired to do right Oh true

1046
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,050
absolutely true and of course he

1047
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,850
downloaded it and downloaded our

1048
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:12,560
malicious document then on Twitter

1049
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,420
upcoming event but again that can be

1050
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,790
useful for fishing if you're looking for

1051
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,470
in a company this is not as useful as it

1052
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:20,750
used to be because Twitter has changed

1053
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,700
what's public so someone has to go turn

1054
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,890
on location data but if you can get

1055
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,629
coordinates you can do a Twitter search

1056
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,940
and as you can see there you can search

1057
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,440
within a radius of a location and you

1058
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,660
can see everything posted on Twitter at

1059
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,640
that location so if I have employees

1060
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,069
tweeting from work and they have their

1061
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,450
data public I can start seeing who is at

1062
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,370
that facility of this headquarters

1063
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,169
building saying surfing out from their

1064
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,509
works at the company you can of course

1065
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,220
you can look for media in a tool that

1066
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,900
works you good for this is tweet beaver

1067
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,730
they have all kinds of things you can

1068
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,200
pull you can download their friends

1069
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,120
their followers conversations I've had

1070
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,520
with individuals if or not they follow

1071
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,319
another person it's a useful tool of

1072
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,060
course linked in is a trove of data

1073
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,770
you've got employees names you have

1074
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,270
departments they're in you can start

1075
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,310
looking at the employee responsibilities

1076
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,810
what they're doing post in I work at

1077
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,850
this company I do this this and this

1078
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,650
they sometimes talk about the tools

1079
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,600
they're using um that can be useful

1080
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:14,120
information figure out who's who's boss

1081
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,170
sometimes based on chain of who's who

1082
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,348
vice-president

1083
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,420
cetera managers

1084
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,190
then communities and forums Stack

1085
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,079
Overflow is a great place to find

1086
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,699
information if the person is using a

1087
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,440
username with their username in it or

1088
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:27,940
their email address somewhere you can

1089
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,410
start getting ideas or what kind of

1090
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,539
solutions and software they have in

1091
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:33,519
place github we're always looking for

1092
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:35,140
hard-coded credentials you can find

1093
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,238
information github sometimes the code

1094
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,578
for websites all kinds of stuff again

1095
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:41,769
like we mentioned the file types within

1096
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:45,099
that confidential and this is a document

1097
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:46,959
we found on the open web videos before I

1098
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:48,219
target by a company or an individual I'm

1099
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,899
gonna go look at some videos up and what

1100
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:51,609
are the words that use their phrases and

1101
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,380
use how do they talk and then we're

1102
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,808
gonna mirror our attack to be similar to

1103
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:58,569
that IP addresses if you can find IP

1104
00:38:55,809 --> 00:39:00,699
addresses say you're using DNS leaf DNS

1105
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:02,739
looking up the company maybe use MX

1106
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:04,599
records to find their IP addresses not

1107
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:06,459
always successful sometimes it does work

1108
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,079
all right so let's talk about some of

1109
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:09,609
these social engineering attacks that we

1110
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,999
have done recently that have worked very

1111
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:12,729
well

1112
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:14,589
fake portals work tremendously well to

1113
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:16,209
get usernames and passwords so this is

1114
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:17,529
one that we've seen a few times and this

1115
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:20,589
works very good at the end of the year

1116
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:22,239
so it's where the company had a good

1117
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:24,038
year we're gonna share some of the

1118
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,959
profit with our employees we've

1119
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:27,549
deposited money into an account we just

1120
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:29,739
need you to log in and go move that to

1121
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:31,119
your portal and that has that works well

1122
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:33,609
at the end of the year again if we're

1123
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,869
causing a motion and that email takes

1124
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:37,029
them to this site and if you go to

1125
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:39,279
401k.com it redirects you to a site and

1126
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:40,539
this is the fake one that we built on

1127
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:41,979
this particular time we're using

1128
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:43,930
WordPress and as you see the login

1129
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:45,848
that's actually a contact form and

1130
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,410
contact form 7 a plugin for WordPress

1131
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:49,059
has a nice feature that you can make the

1132
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,949
password field it'll actually dot dot

1133
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:52,839
dot it so it looks totally legit to them

1134
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:53,979
they hit login and it's actually a

1135
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,049
contact form that sends you an email

1136
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:57,848
with a username and password so this is

1137
00:39:56,049 --> 00:40:00,400
the real site I'm sorry I got it myself

1138
00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:03,160
I mean this is a fake fight we built so

1139
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,770
as you can see it's pretty well closed

1140
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,930
does a fake o365 quarter we build again

1141
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,590
we have to train users just because it

1142
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,839
looks normal

1143
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,310
if you're in a hurry you still need to

1144
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,860
take the time I like a look at the URL

1145
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:15,970
is it the ER L you go to and what are

1146
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,670
some things that can stand out about

1147
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,680
this first off if you notice no account

1148
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:22,450
create one those are not links the real

1149
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,970
site those should be links a fake

1150
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,919
LinkedIn portal a fake OWA portal some

1151
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:28,540
organizations customizer W 8 portals he

1152
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,310
put an image in the background and if

1153
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,710
that's the case we're gonna make ours

1154
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:34,000
look just like the real one maybe we're

1155
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,010
trying to get them to install some kind

1156
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,870
of software an app we've created some

1157
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,340
scenarios around that and that can be

1158
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,200
very very useful again so like the

1159
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,820
organization I talked about we now knew

1160
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,950
what kind of input protection they had

1161
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,900
so we could go create a payload that

1162
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:49,569
would not be caught by that in a virus

1163
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,340
malicious documents are this is the one

1164
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:53,050
I was talking about Leo SCP that forum

1165
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,490
we had them fill out that was a payload

1166
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,920
at forum that connected back to our

1167
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,350
command and control server we can attack

1168
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,790
an organization and we can get in but

1169
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,710
how do we change this how do we help

1170
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,720
these organizations and the first thing

1171
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,400
we have to train our employees not to be

1172
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,799
afraid to challenge they can't be afraid

1173
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,230
to say say if the boss I don't trust

1174
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,820
this I'm gonna go verify we have to

1175
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,950
change the mentality and tell them

1176
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,690
upfront build a culture of challenging

1177
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:19,480
training them not to be afraid nothing

1178
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,070
bad is going to happen man i when we're

1179
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,480
training go into an organization to

1180
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,430
actually train the employees I like to

1181
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,650
have them do what I call an osa or an

1182
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,690
open-source self-assessment so I want

1183
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,040
the employees to go and start looking at

1184
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,230
their social media look at their

1185
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,940
Facebook what information can someone

1186
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:36,010
see about them what do you tweet about

1187
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,660
what do you post on Facebook what kind

1188
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:40,930
of pictures do you post target children

1189
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,250
there then start writing this down we

1190
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,779
actually have the people write down with

1191
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,670
the kinds of information that they post

1192
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,040
that's public maybe it's the news

1193
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,530
section of the website then when an

1194
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,509
attacker comes they say hey public

1195
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:55,150
information that can be used against me

1196
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,620
and it helps them start separating just

1197
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,020
because someone knows some information

1198
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,609
something that seems quite a bit secret

1199
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,370
whatever it doesn't mean they are who

1200
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:05,560
they say they are never trust and always

1201
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,660
verify this is something we have to

1202
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,400
teach employees always verify if

1203
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,740
possible let's do an out-of-band

1204
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,020
verification I call it so they send me

1205
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,589
an e-mail I'm gonna go to Google find

1206
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,969
their website get their phone number

1207
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:19,160
there I'm not not going to use the phone

1208
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:20,900
number in the footer of email just cuz I

1209
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,308
wanna let's real if it's a phone call

1210
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,140
they add call asked me to do something

1211
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:25,999
I'll say fine I can do that in five

1212
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,549
minutes and then I'm gonna email them to

1213
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:30,288
verify always verify request to do

1214
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:32,599
things especially things that are not

1215
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:35,239
ordinary or different and then the final

1216
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:37,849
tip we give to people is whatever you're

1217
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:40,609
being asked to do if it causes any kind

1218
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:44,269
of emotion any emotion be that fear

1219
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:45,469
excitement anxiety pressure be that from

1220
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:49,459
an authority someone needs something

1221
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:52,249
quickly compassion pride any kind of

1222
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:53,479
emotion don't take action stop go do

1223
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:55,098
something else for five minutes

1224
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:57,198
and then come back and read it again

1225
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:58,579
because it's likely not real because

1226
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,099
that's what attackers do they want you

1227
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:02,509
to cause a motion so that is how we can

1228
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:05,869
start to change this and our

1229
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:08,299
organizations alright well thank you so

1230
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:10,369
much sir fantastic presentation I do

1231
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:12,650
appreciate it would you say after you

1232
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:14,869
you talked about kind of an evolution of

1233
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,829
your social engineering engagements what

1234
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:17,809
would you say

1235
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:20,390
kind of the percentage of improvement

1236
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:21,859
you got the social engineering like you

1237
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,359
said you started this journey a couple

1238
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:24,920
of years ago would you say you're far

1239
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,660
more successful now than you were before

1240
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,249
with some of the old and sale techniques

1241
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,719
oh absolutely

1242
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:31,428
the philosophy engagements we've done

1243
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:33,380
when we look at start looking at

1244
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:36,499
individuals and when we tailor our

1245
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,689
attacks to that individual and we build

1246
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:42,640
our attack with into a conversation we

1247
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:42,640
have success nearly 100% of the time
