1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,680
all right so we've got uh

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,520
patrick and tom coming up so this

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,400
particular presentation whenever we were

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,320
setting it up

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
and kind of thinking about it going

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,840
through the talks we really really

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,360
really liked this one because

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,880
i believe that most people think that

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,600
penetration testing and running a red

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,680
team

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,359
is you know just basically all fun and

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,759
shenanigans all day long

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,519
and while it is a lot of fun and it is

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,480
an amazing career path

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,639
there's a tremendous amount of

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
infrastructure and kind of background

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,560
and support that you have to give your

18
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
testers

19
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,120
and things that make them successful

20
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,480
rather than trying to reinvent the wheel

21
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,120
every single time patrick tom

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,160
take it away thank you everyone for

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,399
coming to

24
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,919
how to build a high-performing red team

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
really appreciate everyone who's

26
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,600
attending i know this has been an

27
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,239
interesting change of venue

28
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,239
and on that note also a big shout out to

29
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,718
the organizers for for doing this i know

30
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,559
that

31
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,320
they probably jumped through a lot of

32
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,199
last minute hoops to try to make this

33
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,399
happen and make

34
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,000
what they thought was the best decision

35
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,440
for everyone and i have a lot of a lot

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,519
of respect for

37
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,360
what they did to make this happen so so

38
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,040
big thank you to everyone who put this

39
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
on so i'm patrick fussell i'm a member

40
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,000
of

41
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,880
x4 spreads red team i've been working in

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
infosec from

43
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,520
in one form or another for about nine

44
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,920
years looking at quite a few conferences

45
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,119
i've been at hackfest nola con visa dell

46
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
v girkon just

47
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,680
touched on a few of them however i

48
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,799
started my professional life as a marine

49
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
after graduating from the college of

50
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,520
charleston in 2006. i'm tom porter

51
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,960
a member of the fusionx red team i've

52
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,399
been there for a few years now

53
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,479
you might know me from some bloodhound

54
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,799
extensions i've authored and a

55
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,400
geolocation-based word list generation

56
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,560
tool for hash cracking

57
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
you can find me at porterhouse on

58
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,880
twitter and bloodhound slack

59
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
as well as discord so patrick and i are

60
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,920
going to keep an eye

61
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,839
on discord throughout the talks you guys

62
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
have questions comments throw them in

63
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
at that track one talks channel we'll

64
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,479
try to circle back to those at the end

65
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
prior to my infosec career i was a

66
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,960
pitcher in the san diego padres

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,920
organization

68
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,679
so i was drafted back in 2009 and i

69
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,680
played professionally for a little while

70
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
before i actually went out and got a

71
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,080
real

72
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
job now the reason that patrick and i

73
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
mentioned our previous careers here and

74
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,120
we chose these particular pictures from

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
10 plus years ago it's because we

76
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,920
realized that

77
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
patrick's background as a marine and

78
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,519
mine as an athlete

79
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,640
had a lot of overlap with what we do now

80
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,760
as red teamers

81
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,799
so we had these team-based high-stressed

82
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,640
experiences

83
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
we found a lot of common ground so

84
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,559
patrick and i worked together previously

85
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
at a pci-based penetration testing firm

86
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,200
where we worked there for a number of

87
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,079
years and one of our favorite topics of

88
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,879
conversation

89
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,200
were was the effectiveness of our team

90
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,720
so you know where were we strong and why

91
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,640
were we strong in those areas

92
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,920
and what areas were we weak and how can

93
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,640
we shore those up and when we did that

94
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,200
oftentimes we came back to this question

95
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,359
what makes a red team effective

96
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,440
now first of all why do we even care

97
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,879
what makes a red team effective

98
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
and to us we think it's it's fairly

99
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,480
simple we like to see happier people we

100
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,239
want to see people grow

101
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,079
in their careers professionally we want

102
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,840
to see stronger teams we want to see

103
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
better work environments and we want to

104
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,000
see the industry grow and evolve

105
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
and we think effective red teams moves

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
towards that goal

107
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,120
now there's a million different ways you

108
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680
could approach trying to answer this

109
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
question

110
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,959
the thing that jumped out to patrick and

111
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,679
i first was kind of the red team aspect

112
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,000
of it

113
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,760
so from our backgrounds we were members

114
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,760
of high performing groups

115
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,599
we operated in stressful environments

116
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,640
and we had a shared mission

117
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,119
with our team members your failure to

118
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,760
know

119
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
and execute your role meant failure for

120
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
the team

121
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,920
and that's a heavy burden to place on

122
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
yourself especially when you're

123
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,399
operating

124
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,920
like in the capacity that patrick was in

125
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
the military

126
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,079
but with it with that heavy burden comes

127
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,439
a lot of hard lessons learned and we'll

128
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,439
share some of those today

129
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,599
you might focus on the what aspect so

130
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,519
maybe what's at a red team's disposal

131
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,879
things like their their ttps or tactics

132
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,879
techniques and procedures

133
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,239
while we think those are important we

134
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,000
think they're more of a result

135
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,519
they're a result of other foundational

136
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,280
elements of that team

137
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,799
like the core principles the team's

138
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
culture and just how they're

139
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,920
organizationally structured

140
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,760
is your team layout in a way that

141
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,959
supports communication and growth and

142
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,519
accountability

143
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,680
how rigorous is your hiring process how

144
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,759
well do leaders balance the dichotomy

145
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,919
between discipline and autonomy for

146
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,600
their operators

147
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,520
and lastly you might focus on the

148
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,160
effective part of this and how we define

149
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,479
that

150
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,320
and you might look at maybe quantitative

151
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,320
metrics you know things like

152
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,320
client retention rate or revenue or

153
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,680
growth or success rate or

154
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,240
some other key performance indicator

155
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,600
whether factory you want to focus on

156
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,720
but there's other things that play into

157
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,919
that equation what about the

158
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
relationships that you built with your

159
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,479
client

160
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,758
what about the relationships and

161
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,120
communication channels you've built

162
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,240
within your organization across

163
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,919
different departments

164
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,759
and what about alignment how closely are

165
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,680
your team's actions and results

166
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,880
align with the organization's overall

167
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
mission and

168
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,479
when engagement's over how do you take

169
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,600
that knowledge and that experience that

170
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,359
you just gained

171
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
and feed it back into the team so you

172
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,039
can encourage growth and forward

173
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,479
progress for everyone

174
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,320
so we're going to explore these topics

175
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,240
today and this is patrick and i's

176
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,880
uh humble attempt at trying to answer

177
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,639
this question and it's a combination of

178
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,639
the people we've interviewed and

179
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,080
interacted with over the years

180
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,560
some books and research that we've done

181
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,719
within the infosec space and as well as

182
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,039
outside of it in other disciplines

183
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
and just partially our own experience as

184
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,159
members of

185
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,119
various successful teams and we hope

186
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,880
that when you

187
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,720
walk away from this this virtual talk

188
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,240
today maybe you have a couple notes

189
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,280
that you can take back to your team and

190
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,560
start talking about implementing

191
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,919
so we've broken this talk into three

192
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,280
different sections the first one here is

193
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,240
the red team mission i'll talk about

194
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,559
what that means

195
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
how it plays into mission scope and just

196
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,600
why we do

197
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,880
what we do as red teamers and to

198
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,800
illustrate that why

199
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
i'm going to tell you a story about

200
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
where i grew up in charlotte north

201
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,639
carolina

202
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
and playing baseball so i played

203
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,319
baseball competitively since i was a

204
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,759
little kid up through high school

205
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,759
and i decided i want to try to advance

206
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,120
my career to maybe go into

207
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,759
the collegiate ranks or even play

208
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,120
professionally one day so i sought out a

209
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,160
group that would help me do that and i

210
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
came across

211
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,280
an organization called the on deck

212
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,080
baseball and softball development

213
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,599
academy

214
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,440
you know started by this guy that you

215
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,639
see there on the right his name is mike

216
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,479
schilt

217
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,479
now the purpose of on deck was to kind

218
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,919
of develop and train young players and

219
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,758
put them in front of college and pro

220
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,198
scouts and play across

221
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,960
the country in different tournaments and

222
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
hopefully these kids would get developed

223
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
and put in position to marry they could

224
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,759
get a scholarship or maybe they could

225
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
get drafted

226
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,120
now about mike he grew up in charlotte

227
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,199
too his mom

228
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,720
was an assistant to the owner of the

229
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,560
charlotte o's which was the double-a

230
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
affiliate of the baltimore orioles

231
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,600
and this was charlotte's my league

232
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,679
baseball team at the time

233
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,960
and so as an eight-year-old mike went to

234
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
the ballpark every day

235
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,799
he shagged fly balls of the players he

236
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,080
shined their shoes he operated the

237
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
scoreboard during the game

238
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,359
and his mom was the one who brought him

239
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
to the park and she really fostered

240
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,720
that relationship that he had with

241
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,639
baseball and the players

242
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,400
and that's where mike's initial passion

243
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,440
for the sport began he got really close

244
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,880
with the players

245
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,560
and he decided then that he wanted to

246
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,319
try to become a major league baseball

247
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,319
player

248
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,440
it reminded me a lot of my relationship

249
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,440
with my dad and

250
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,639
maybe many of you out there feel

251
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,800
something similar had some

252
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,319
summer experience with someone you know

253
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
i remember sitting in my dad's lap as a

254
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,319
little kid

255
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,758
and we're at the computer and we're

256
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,479
playing things like heroes of might and

257
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,759
magic

258
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,159
or he got me i don't know if you guys

259
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,000
remember those lego mindstorm sets

260
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,440
those little programmable robots from

261
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,039
from lego you can play around with we

262
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,880
had a blast doing that

263
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,719
and it kind of sparked that interest in

264
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
me of you know computers and problem

265
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,759
solving and programming

266
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,520
and i had no idea where i was going to

267
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,280
end up you know i had no idea i would be

268
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,440
doing infosec today i even know what

269
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,719
infosec was until my world of warcraft

270
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,400
account got hacked when i was still

271
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,520
playing baseball in college but it was

272
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,560
an interest i pursued

273
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,280
and this is where it took me similarly

274
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
to mike

275
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,359
he decided to pursue that passion of

276
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
playing major league baseball so he went

277
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,240
and played

278
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,679
baseball at unc asheville and that was

279
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
it that's where his career fizzled out

280
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,840
as a player

281
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,239
he realized he was a below average

282
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,039
baseball player so he shifted focus over

283
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
to coaching

284
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,240
he coached for a high school in

285
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,919
charlotte he then coached for

286
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
unc asheville at his alma mater and he

287
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,520
coasted unc charlotte

288
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,758
eventually he decided to break off and

289
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,120
create on deck if you ran into mike in

290
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,000
the hallways of on deck

291
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
you could tell he was a pretty

292
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,280
mild-mannered guy but once you got into

293
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
a dugout with mike

294
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,878
you could see a switch flip and this

295
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,479
passion came out

296
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,560
and i still haven't met a man that was

297
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,199
more passionate about baseball than he

298
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,958
was

299
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,399
and his passion for the sport is what

300
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,919
and led him to create

301
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
on deck it was the purpose that was

302
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,679
implied with the name of the academy for

303
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,479
those of you unfamiliar with baseball

304
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,560
terminology

305
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
the on deck circle is where a hitter

306
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,119
who's next up in the order prepares for

307
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,399
their at-bat

308
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,680
and that's what mike wanted to do with

309
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,360
charlotte's youth you want to prepare

310
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,479
them for the next level

311
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,880
whether it was in baseball or life to do

312
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
that

313
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,720
he created these six different

314
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
principles and if you walk in the front

315
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,480
door of the on deck offices in south

316
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,040
charlotte you'll see this hanging up on

317
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,640
the wall

318
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,439
and this is a screen grab from one of

319
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,839
the local charlotte news broadcast

320
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,560
laid out they look like this leadership

321
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,279
respect

322
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,119
making a difference integrity service

323
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,640
and commitment

324
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,160
if you look at the language associated

325
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,040
with those six things you see things

326
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
like

327
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,040
we raise the bar we set the standard we

328
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,640
are dependable

329
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,880
we want to make our community a better

330
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,040
place now by looking at this you would

331
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,800
have no idea it was associated with the

332
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,560
baseball development program

333
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,760
but these are the principles mike

334
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,640
realizes the principles that are

335
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,959
applicable to

336
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,560
any industry or any discipline they were

337
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,160
transferable skills

338
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,439
and didn't take talent to live up to

339
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,880
these things it only took discipline

340
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,040
now if you turn to the left you would

341
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,160
see this wall that had a bunch of the

342
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,120
players that were currently going

343
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,120
through the program

344
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,399
and on down the hallway where players

345
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,640
from the past two decades

346
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,480
have gone through the program so each of

347
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,279
these shows a player their current

348
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
school

349
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
and then where they went on to play

350
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
either in college or in the professional

351
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,518
ranks

352
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
so you see things like duke university

353
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,839
some other colleges there in the

354
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,199
southeast

355
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,360
as well as some of the professional

356
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,079
programs but this

357
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,600
wall served two particular purposes one

358
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,319
for each athlete that came through that

359
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,240
building

360
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,279
it reminded them of the mission you know

361
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
what they're they're trying to

362
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,680
accomplish

363
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
and on deck was not afraid to tell their

364
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,680
story of what they were doing

365
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,680
and secondly it connected these players

366
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,279
with the present with where they were

367
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,239
and the future with where they wanted to

368
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,160
be it helped them visualize success

369
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,519
and it helps provide a target for them

370
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,199
to move towards

371
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,959
and i realized this when i was walking

372
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,519
through the offices of fusion x where we

373
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,518
work

374
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,279
so up in arlington virginia in the

375
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
fusion x space of the office

376
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,200
when you walk in the door you see this

377
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,480
so you see some of the cool projects

378
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,200
that some of our guys have built

379
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,959
arcade machine you see a demo that we've

380
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,920
built to simulate blowing up an oil

381
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,518
refinery

382
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,959
and on the left hand side you see a

383
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,480
sample of some of the placards that we

384
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,160
hang around the office

385
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,519
and these placards tell stories of

386
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,600
fusion x and what they've done on some

387
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,120
of their past adversary simulations

388
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,959
things like having your finger on the

389
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,040
light switch of millions of homes

390
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,040
or how we stole money simultaneously

391
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,959
from multiple casinos

392
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,160
so whenever i walk into the office i see

393
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,160
these things and

394
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,519
reminds me of what we're there to do it

395
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,680
reminds me of the caliber

396
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,200
the caliber of people that i work with

397
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,920
and it pushes me just a little bit

398
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,519
harder to be better

399
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,839
so going back to mike this is where his

400
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,600
story really gets interesting in 2004

401
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,200
he sold on deck and he went on to pursue

402
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,079
his passion professionally with san

403
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,320
diego or at the

404
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,519
st louis cardinals as a scout and he did

405
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,480
that for five years

406
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,000
and then they gave him a shot at

407
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,480
managing the rookie level minor league

408
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
team and he won two championships there

409
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,760
then they bumped him up to double a and

410
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,640
he won a championship there and was

411
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,319
named name of the

412
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,800
was named a team of the year by baseball

413
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
america they bumped him up to triple a

414
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,800
just one step away from the big leagues

415
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,480
and he became a triple-a all-star coach

416
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,399
two years later they actually bumped him

417
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,600
up to the big league the big leagues as

418
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
an assistant coach

419
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
then he got bumped up to the third base

420
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,880
coach and then in 2018

421
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,480
he was the bench coach which is

422
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,680
essentially the right-hand man

423
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,519
of the manager mike matheny

424
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,959
halfway through the 2018 season the

425
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,760
cardinals fired their manager mike

426
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,439
matheny

427
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,360
and then named mike shield the interim

428
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
manager over the next

429
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,800
month and a half he led the cardinals to

430
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
the best record in baseball

431
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,599
they decided to remove that interim

432
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,240
title that made him the full-time

433
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,839
manager

434
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,160
and the game a three-year contract

435
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,880
extension

436
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,439
after the season was over mlb network

437
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,279
they have

438
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,959
uh live presentations where they hand

439
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,839
out wards and he won national league

440
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,359
manager of the year

441
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,120
there's a link here at the bottom i'll

442
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,959
post this in discord if you guys have

443
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
two minutes in between talks or sometime

444
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,839
tomorrow or whatever it may be

445
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,359
i encourage you to go check out this

446
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,720
interview because you can see mike

447
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,360
receiving this award live

448
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,480
and um you'll see my talk about all the

449
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,800
things that we just

450
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,639
we just mentioned here in this talk he

451
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,560
talks about how this award was

452
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,079
even though it's an individual award it

453
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,800
was for the team it was for the

454
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,359
organization

455
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,560
it was for the players he just is the

456
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,040
recipient of it because

457
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,560
he was part of the the movement to get

458
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,240
the team to achieve their mission and

459
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
that was what his goal was

460
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,079
you can see him credit his mom and his

461
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
upbringing and sparking that passion and

462
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,199
that interest in him

463
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,200
and that's what it was it was mike

464
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,880
finding his why he had no idea that he

465
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,639
would end up where he is today

466
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,480
but he took those principles that he

467
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,880
hung up on the wall and on deck

468
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,480
and he embodied them and he beaten them

469
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,079
to the rest of the the

470
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,440
players and coaches around him and they

471
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,439
followed him and they found success

472
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,880
so i'm going to look at the why a little

473
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,399
more abstractly and this from simon's

474
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,079
next book start with fly

475
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,720
and in there he has this notion of a

476
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,719
golden circle and it represents how

477
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,160
organizations and teams and leaders

478
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,839
think to communicate

479
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,920
so on the outermost ring would be the

480
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,279
what and members of a team organization

481
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,279
know what they do

482
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,839
you know we sell widgets we perform

483
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,680
adversary simulations

484
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,600
fewer people on the team understand how

485
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,760
they do it and this is your

486
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,320
differentiator this is what

487
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,560
sets you apart from your competition so

488
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,639
we perform adversary simulations

489
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,800
we're really good at it and clients love

490
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,519
us you know it's not a really inspiring

491
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,439
sales pitch

492
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,920
but that's how people tend to process

493
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,880
this kind of information

494
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,639
his argument throughout the text is that

495
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,279
the organizations and teams and leaders

496
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,920
out there

497
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,880
that start on the inside with why

498
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,880
they're the ones that

499
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,720
tend to innovate and inspire and find

500
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,959
success

501
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,560
and they work their way out from there

502
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,880
so to think about this in a red teaming

503
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,880
context i'm going to level 7 definitions

504
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,560
and the one i chose is from joe vest and

505
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,439
i first saw it there at the blog you see

506
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
linked at the bottom

507
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,720
but it's my favorite definition that

508
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,800
i've come across for red teaming

509
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,839
and in that blog post he has this graph

510
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,199
that you see that

511
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,480
kind of shows the difference between red

512
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,920
teaming versus penetration testing

513
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,199
versus vulnerability assessments and the

514
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
difference between depth and breadth of

515
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,920
them

516
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,920
and how red teaming is more geared

517
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,079
towards sophisticated organizations

518
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,760
just like how you wouldn't have honey

519
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,439
pots deployed before you have patch

520
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,959
management process in place

521
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,399
you wouldn't do red teaming until you've

522
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,479
got your vulnerability assessments and

523
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,399
your penetration down pat

524
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,160
now that definition is red teaming is

525
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,760
the process of using tactics techniques

526
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,760
and procedures or ttps

527
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,279
to emulate a real world threat with the

528
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,480
goals of training and measuring the

529
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,959
effectiveness of people

530
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,639
processes and technology used to defend

531
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,638
an environment

532
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,160
now the reason i like this definition so

533
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,399
much is because it hits on those three

534
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,480
things that we just talked about

535
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,959
what is red teaming it's an infosec

536
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,199
sense it's emulating a real world threat

537
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,880
how do we do it by mimicking that

538
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,040
threat's ttps

539
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,320
but why do we do it with two goals we

540
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,000
want to measure

541
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,440
and train the effectiveness of people

542
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
processes and technologies used to

543
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,959
defend an environment

544
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,040
and you can take this definition and

545
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,959
pick it up and apply it to

546
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,160
whatever industry your client your

547
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,359
organization might be in

548
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,600
as long as you add a little bit of

549
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,040
empathy with it so if maybe if you're in

550
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
the financial services district you

551
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,680
could say

552
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,199
i want to protect the credit of my

553
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,120
family and friends so they can go out

554
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,040
and one day buy a house

555
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,399
or maybe if you're in the telecom

556
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,160
industry you know i want to protect

557
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,560
against sim swapping attacks

558
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,279
so my wife her online identity doesn't

559
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,279
get wiped out

560
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
joe and james released this book red

561
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,240
team development operations back in

562
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,279
january it's out on amazon

563
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,720
if you haven't checked it out yet

564
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,639
encourage that you do it's a great read

565
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,720
it's also going to level set on mission

566
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,320
scope so you hear patrick and i refer to

567
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,600
different missions throughout the talk

568
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
and depends on context what we're

569
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,560
talking about so typically there's two

570
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,480
different contexts for missions

571
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,758
the first being the overall strategic

572
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,040
vision and this would

573
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,480
usually align with your organization's

574
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,160
mission statement it's kind of the big

575
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
picture of what you want to accomplish

576
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,560
as an organization and to do that you

577
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,800
have smaller tactical missions

578
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,160
with tangible objectives so when we're

579
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,359
talking about red teaming

580
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,680
we're usually talking about this level

581
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,320
of scope as we move from client to

582
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,040
client or

583
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,160
engagement to engagement now when it

584
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,240
comes to communicating

585
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,160
all of this down to your team it's

586
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,839
important that you deliver in these two

587
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,600
critical areas the mission

588
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,440
and the intent the mission being what we

589
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,279
just described so we wouldn't describe

590
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
the overall strategic vision

591
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,480
and we want to describe what achieving

592
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,880
those tackle objectives

593
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,559
looks like and you couple that with the

594
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,880
intent behind it that purpose

595
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,639
the why are we doing this and if you

596
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,439
give that along with the desired end

597
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,839
state you know

598
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,280
what does that look like it gives your

599
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,480
front line troops your red team

600
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,319
operators a goal

601
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,959
it allows them to take those risks that

602
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,639
are necessary to achieve that mission

603
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,559
if they know their left and right bounds

604
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,199
of authority when it comes to decision

605
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,879
making

606
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,319
they can make those decisions without

607
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
pestering upper management and it gives

608
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,678
them some autonomy to operate in that

609
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,959
space

610
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,120
so some of the key takeaways from this

611
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,960
first section firstly

612
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,639
find that why believe in the mission

613
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,880
understand it and communicate it

614
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,320
if you don't understand the mission and

615
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,679
if you can't communicate it down

616
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,360
how can you expect the people in the

617
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,760
chain below you to understand it

618
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,320
so buy into it it makes the others below

619
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,559
you easier to buy into

620
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,520
secondly if you want your team to move

621
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,000
towards a target

622
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,799
you have to give them a target so find

623
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
those priorities

624
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,240
name them rank them and then this will

625
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,960
get everyone focused

626
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,200
and moving in the same direction and

627
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
then lastly help that team visualize

628
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,320
what success looks like in your

629
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,760
environment so flood the environment

630
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,678
with reminders of successes that

631
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,360
demonstrate the purpose of the mission

632
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,520
help them connect the present with where

633
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,479
we are with the future and where we want

634
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,120
to be

635
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,559
so with that i will kick it back over to

636
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,399
patrick

637
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,240
all right excellent through cat memes

638
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,840
and i just noticed that tom added a nice

639
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,559
note in my speaker notes so appreciate

640
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,399
that tom

641
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,320
what do cat memes have to do with

642
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
building a team obviously the answer is

643
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,960
nothing but

644
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,720
i felt like we had done the whole

645
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,240
presentation we had no cat memes and

646
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
this was the only place i could find a

647
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,360
stick one so

648
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,720
check that one off for the off the list

649
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,000
something that's integral to how the

650
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,880
team operates and performs

651
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
its culture but what is culture in the

652
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
context of a team

653
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,000
i think if you were to look up the

654
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,760
dictionary definition of culture it

655
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,280
falls a little bit short of capturing

656
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,360
the nuances of

657
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,960
what is a team's culture so i did a

658
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,039
little googling around

659
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
and this is the definition that really

660
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,640
struck a chord for me

661
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,840
it captures this idea of the million

662
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,840
little things that you do from

663
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,799
minute to minute or hour to hour that

664
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,799
really define what the team is

665
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,400
you think about any team organization

666
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,720
that you've been a part of

667
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,120
be it good or bad how would you describe

668
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,240
that culture to an outsider

669
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,678
what are the first things that come to

670
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,039
mind when you contemplate that

671
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,280
particular group's culture

672
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,480
maybe it's a culture of excellence or

673
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,039
maybe they just had overall apathy

674
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,320
you'll see it's kind of a often a lot of

675
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,039
little things that make up

676
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,639
that overall feel of the team why is

677
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,480
this important well you want your team's

678
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,160
culture to contribute to a success and

679
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,240
be one that improves the lives of its

680
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,679
members

681
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,440
so one of my first schools in the marine

682
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,600
corps i encountered my

683
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,200
what i think is my first instance of an

684
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,918
organization that really had a culture

685
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,840
of

686
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,360
we strive to do always do things the

687
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,120
right way

688
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,399
and you know in retrospect what i've

689
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,559
noticed is

690
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,880
that mindset stem from the leadership of

691
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,200
the commander of that particular school

692
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,720
i noticed he did lots of things that he

693
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,320
always pushed a little bit harder than

694
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,480
everyone would maybe really

695
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,960
want to be pushed he did things like

696
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,880
lots of super early physical training

697
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,480
that was particularly challenging

698
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,400
regular room inspections uniform

699
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,080
inspections strong accountability for

700
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,080
leadership at all levels these are all

701
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,960
things that maybe he didn't necessarily

702
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,879
have to do

703
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,720
but in general he had a very consistent

704
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,520
high expectations for everyone's level

705
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,679
of performance

706
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,440
now the result of this is every member

707
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,559
of the unit internalized that mindset

708
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,559
and carried over into

709
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,080
everything they did not just where this

710
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,240
commander has oversight

711
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,000
they understood that the the group

712
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,480
benefited when each individual tried to

713
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,799
hold themselves to a higher standard of

714
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,320
operating this sort of spillover effect

715
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,200
made the entire unit really stand out as

716
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,520
being excellent

717
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,440
or what you might call a culture of

718
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,280
excellence earlier tom mentioned that uh

719
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,760
he and i worked together at a um

720
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,120
a pen testing firm several years ago and

721
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,000
looking back on it one of the questions

722
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,360
that came up is

723
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
what's the difference between being

724
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,320
employed and actually being part of a

725
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,959
team

726
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,678
when we're working at this company when

727
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,520
we first

728
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,120
got hired on or as we were getting

729
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,158
started uh

730
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,799
it was very much a a standard of

731
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,799
every man for himself not a lot of

732
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,559
defined standards or procedures

733
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,879
you know every engagement was executed

734
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,559
solo it was a fully remote team and we

735
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
didn't have a lot of incentive to

736
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,480
work together to get anything done so we

737
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,240
were getting work done but it wasn't

738
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,159
focused on making the team better or

739
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
contributing to the team in any way

740
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,200
so fortunately over time we saw a lot of

741
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,679
maturity grow

742
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,640
to the team and it really turned into

743
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,679
what i would describe as

744
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,720
a cohesive unit so what changed an early

745
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,039
change that i saw

746
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,720
that was particularly impactful was just

747
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,879
improved communications

748
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,159
we were fully remote so really that

749
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,200
initial step was

750
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,559
deploying a robust chat application and

751
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,559
it's not just a chat application that

752
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,280
was important it's what it did and that

753
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,120
was

754
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,639
i think one of the most impactful things

755
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,479
was give the team a place to bullshit

756
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,080
allow the team members to develop

757
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,159
relationships that otherwise

758
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,199
weren't in place that makes a lot easier

759
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,440
to do things like ask for help

760
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,039
it also helps improve insight into how

761
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,280
is everybody else operating

762
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,640
things something as simple as saying hey

763
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,360
how are you guys handling

764
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,559
xyz situation this lets everyone share

765
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,799
ideas and practices

766
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,559
which leads to development of maybe

767
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,240
standard operating practices

768
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,240
so uh so you're getting something

769
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,320
consistent from the team

770
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,840
some other changes stem from the

771
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,600
leadership style of our manager

772
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,678
he was definitely an enabler more than a

773
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,240
typical manager instead of

774
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,840
do what i say he was more likely to say

775
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,679
what do you need to be successful

776
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,199
this made it easy to give them feedback

777
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,280
recommend changes

778
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,440
strategies for the team or i asked for

779
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,840
the things that we needed to do our jobs

780
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,120
the other important piece was he was

781
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,280
never afraid to say

782
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,600
i don't know in technical teams that can

783
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,280
be a really scary thing to do

784
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,639
the there always seems to be this sense

785
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,559
of at least for me

786
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,960
i think i should already know that so i

787
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,559
don't want to look stupid by asking

788
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,400
when you have a leader who's willing to

789
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,000
say i don't know or maybe just ask the

790
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,320
stupid question the rest of the team

791
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,760
feels more comfortable doing the same

792
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,760
team members become more comfortable

793
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,760
with being vulnerable with each other

794
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,760
this builds a sense of belonging to the

795
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,840
team it does things like

796
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,520
encourage learning information sharing

797
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,678
and i think maybe

798
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,520
most importantly help prevent repeated

799
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,480
mistakes so the result of all this is

800
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,480
that creates a

801
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,080
vulnerability loop sharing vulnerability

802
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,640
inside the team builds closeness and

803
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,080
trust

804
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,919
that makes people more likely to be

805
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,439
comfortable being vulnerable and

806
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,960
and what you end up with is a an

807
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,840
increasingly cohesive team

808
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,559
so one last piece of talking about team

809
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,879
communications understanding how to make

810
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,000
sure

811
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,679
we're communicating the right

812
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
information to the right people the

813
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
leaders and managers of the team will

814
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
likely be focused on that strategic goal

815
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,360
those initiatives that tom mentioned

816
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,799
earlier they'll have a clear sense of

817
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,959
what's the bigger picture the team is

818
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,559
moving towards and hopefully they'll be

819
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,880
executing on actions that are moving the

820
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,200
team towards those those broader goals

821
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,000
but leaders have to strike a balance

822
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
here

823
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,440
every member of the team doesn't need

824
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,960
full visit but full visibility and

825
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,720
every detail of every meeting that

826
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,840
management's having that would be a huge

827
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,520
waste of time

828
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,520
however it is crucial that each member

829
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,960
of the team understand what's their role

830
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,639
and how does it fit into this bigger

831
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,159
picture that we're talking about

832
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,320
how are these individual members

833
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,600
contributing to that team's success

834
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,200
when each member feels like they

835
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,639
understand how their efforts help the

836
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
group everyone's more dedicated to the

837
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,880
group's

838
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,719
success and this creates a stronger

839
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,559
sense of belonging kind of a

840
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,080
a piece that goes right along with that

841
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,918
is uh you know individual team members

842
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,480
will likely be focused on tasks

843
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,440
so associated with their specific roles

844
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,279
you probably don't need to call your

845
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,480
boss every 30 minutes tell them exactly

846
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,080
what you're doing but

847
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,159
you do have responsibility as a member

848
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,678
of a team to make sure your boss knows

849
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,279
what you're working on

850
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,279
and kind of an example that i pulled out

851
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,960
of my everyday experiences

852
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,200
hey my boss sends me a slack mess that's

853
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,039
asking me hey are you working on task a

854
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
for xyz project yet maybe this is just

855
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,919
me but

856
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,879
sometimes i my first reaction is i get a

857
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,080
little irritated

858
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,000
i feel like maybe i'm being hassled

859
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,360
about getting work done but you know on

860
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,679
a little contemplation

861
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,719
i think that the correct reaction is to

862
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,400
understand

863
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,400
my boss needs good visibility into what

864
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,400
i'm up to and if he has to ask me it

865
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,360
means i failed in my job to keep him

866
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,880
informed

867
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,719
i need to think about what can i do

868
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,480
better because if they're having to ask

869
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,679
then i fell down somewhere

870
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,600
another part of building a team is

871
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,000
hiring obviously hiring is a

872
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,799
super tough and complex topic that may

873
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,640
be best

874
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,840
and some elements left to more expert

875
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,520
people but

876
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,039
in terms of building a cohesive team

877
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,039
there are a few

878
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,559
i think easier things you can do to

879
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,320
improve the overall process

880
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,559
you always want to ensure the highest

881
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,960
level of rigor possible

882
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,918
making the process challenging is really

883
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,400
important and

884
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,000
now i do want to differentiate here just

885
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,120
through my measures of going through the

886
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,200
hiring process and

887
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,479
doing interviews making it the process

888
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,760
challenging is not the same thing as

889
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,520
just throwing a ton of arbitrary

890
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,679
knowledge questions at someone

891
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,000
i i think if you really think about you

892
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,919
can come up with challenges that require

893
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,360
you know your perspective hire to do

894
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,039
some sort of problem solving so you can

895
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,639
see them work through an issue

896
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,080
see how maybe see how they perform under

897
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
pressure and

898
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,918
what you get is a tough hiring process

899
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,120
builds the sort of shared sense of

900
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,480
suffering which builds a sense of

901
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,840
belonging to the team

902
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,000
if you if you go through a really

903
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,199
rigorous hiring process as soon as you

904
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,279
join you feel like

905
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,039
hey i made it uh we all made it so we've

906
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,080
all been through this the same the same

907
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,640
sort of of

908
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,600
gauntlet so we belong to the team now

909
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,679
another piece is

910
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,000
involving the team in the hiring process

911
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,360
when team members get a say

912
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,120
in who's being hired they get a feeling

913
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,240
of being invested in the overall quality

914
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,158
of the team

915
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,159
and it also means that because they've

916
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,919
already been exposed and helped choose

917
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,840
new hires get more easily accepted into

918
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,120
the group underperformers again it could

919
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,720
be a really tough subject and

920
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,639
maybe probably the subject of its own

921
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,320
set of books and research projects

922
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,760
but i think there's a couple of general

923
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,439
examples we can touch on that

924
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,039
that will give some insight the first

925
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,799
type of underperformer

926
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,080
i call the deadbeat this is an

927
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,760
individual that has

928
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,678
skill and ability to perform but isn't

929
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,440
making the effort isn't committed to

930
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,960
the team's success these in these

931
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,279
situations this is an individual who

932
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,440
needs to become invested in the team

933
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,520
the team success over their own at least

934
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,120
and if you encounter type of person

935
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,480
i think one of the the sort of general

936
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,918
attacks you can take is attempt to

937
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,520
engage them and understand

938
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,279
what's the source of their apathy why

939
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,639
are they so so disconnected or why

940
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,039
aren't they you know giving the real

941
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,679
effort

942
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,679
a sort of side path you can take to with

943
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,520
that same idea in mind is

944
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,120
give this person responsibility put them

945
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,720
in a leadership position so that they're

946
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,199
tied to the success or failure of a

947
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,200
project

948
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
and often what you'll see is someone

949
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,159
goes from being disinterested to being

950
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,919
fully interested and you get

951
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,440
you start to get the best out of them

952
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,760
the second type of underperformer

953
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,039
is someone who may be missing the skills

954
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,480
or knowledge they need to succeed

955
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,240
they're just not meeting the goals that

956
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,760
are set for them if you're set if you

957
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,840
are responsible for someone like this

958
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,520
i think one thing that i'd recommend to

959
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,158
everyone this applies to a lot of places

960
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,639
but

961
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,919
if you're a leader you need to maybe be

962
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,679
honest with yourself before you start

963
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,760
canceling or mentoring someone about

964
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,360
uh not doing what they're supposed to

965
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,559
make it's not on a self-assessment did

966
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,080
you really do an effective job

967
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,760
communicating with this person

968
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,879
did they deeply understand their role

969
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,399
their responsibilities and most

970
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,240
importantly the expectation

971
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,840
you know most people need to have

972
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,600
something to communicate to them clearly

973
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,039
more than once before it really sticks

974
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,120
make sure that give them opportunities

975
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,200
to ask questions so that they are

976
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,479
focusing on what you think they are make

977
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,000
sure underperformers

978
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,840
have their expectations spelled out for

979
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,640
them so that they can focus on doing the

980
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,959
right things

981
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,919
the next step is it's kind of a an evil

982
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
evil word in

983
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,200
in the business world and that is

984
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,080
micromanaging but i think in the right

985
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,080
in some sense

986
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,158
this really just means you're taking a

987
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,360
more detailed role in oversight to train

988
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,039
to mentor someone

989
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,879
who's struggling maybe they're missing

990
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,039
some critical skills so this is an

991
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,480
opportunity for that person to learn

992
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,158
and once they've proven that they've

993
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,840
mastered those skills over time they can

994
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,919
go back to operating with more autonomy

995
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,080
kind of the follow-up here that is i

996
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,399
think equally critical is

997
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,639
if you're quick to fire or discipline

998
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,799
someone when a mistake is made or

999
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,480
or someone's not performing you can

1000
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,440
destroy team cohesion so

1001
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,640
make sure that when you're thinking

1002
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,080
about this you're giving people an

1003
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,600
opportunity to to improve

1004
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,520
and not just going straight to firing

1005
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,959
because if people feel like

1006
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,799
oh just because i made a mistake i'm

1007
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,640
going to get fired you have

1008
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,240
zero team asian people will act in a way

1009
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,520
that only serves their best their best

1010
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
interest and not the interests of the

1011
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,320
team

1012
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,360
all right leading uh um just like the

1013
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,879
last few topics

1014
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,279
the subject of massive amounts of

1015
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,120
research and books and uh you probably

1016
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,480
a lifetime just just talking about this

1017
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
particular topic

1018
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,080
but there's a couple of things i think

1019
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
that that we can focus on

1020
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,158
as leaders in red teams i think the

1021
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,760
first is everyone can be a leader you

1022
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,000
don't have to wait for someone to

1023
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,840
always to designate you to be in charge

1024
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,120
if you have two people working together

1025
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,199
there's an issue that needs to be

1026
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,799
addressed and isn't of being addressed

1027
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,480
that's a chance to step up and take

1028
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,559
charge or something now

1029
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,000
the marine corps focuses hard on

1030
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,039
teaching this idea from from

1031
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,559
day one there's a massive focus on small

1032
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,158
unit leadership and

1033
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,399
solving issues at the lowest possible

1034
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,120
level your marines are trained to step

1035
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,600
up or follow someone in solving an issue

1036
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,199
when soon as that issue is recognized in

1037
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,240
the red team world that might not always

1038
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,080
be prudent to

1039
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,760
just jump up and start barking orders

1040
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,120
probably your first reaction would be

1041
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,760
from your team you know who the hell is

1042
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,879
this guy why is he telling me what to do

1043
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,399
so as an alternative

1044
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,000
when you see one of these issues comes

1045
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,479
up that seems like

1046
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,919
it's right for someone taking charge and

1047
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,679
getting something done

1048
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,279
take time to really consider it ensure

1049
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,720
everyone recognizes

1050
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,480
this is an issue that needs to be

1051
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,760
addressed and give other

1052
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,760
other people a chance to propose

1053
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,240
solutions

1054
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,039
then after everyone recognizes what the

1055
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,360
issue is

1056
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,360
and it's you really thought out what is

1057
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,959
my solution and how would i deliver it

1058
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,719
that's when you can go to the process of

1059
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,240
starting to implement it or presenting

1060
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,520
it a side warning here

1061
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,120
i've noticed that when you spend a lot

1062
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,840
of time coming up with solutions to big

1063
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,520
issues

1064
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,918
you can become emotionally invested in

1065
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,399
them so when one of these things comes

1066
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,480
up

1067
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,520
someone else presents an idea your first

1068
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,600
reaction might be

1069
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,120
to dismiss it if you're in a leadership

1070
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,480
position it's important to let others

1071
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,439
take charge of getting things done

1072
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,960
impossible

1073
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,559
just because that solution is different

1074
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,080
than what you would do

1075
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,840
if it works try to give them the

1076
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,760
opportunity to get things done so what

1077
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,000
to do when a leader isn't leading well

1078
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,919
we

1079
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,519
tested a little bit in uh that last

1080
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,559
slide you know when you see a problem

1081
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,880
that isn't being addressed

1082
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,399
that is a chance to step up but another

1083
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,279
situation you might encounter is a

1084
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,600
leader that

1085
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,720
can't focus or prioritize on the team's

1086
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,399
activities

1087
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,080
so you know i think a lot of people

1088
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,279
recognize when you try to do everything

1089
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,559
you end up doing nothing

1090
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,240
and this is one of the places where

1091
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,039
attack as a team member really comes

1092
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,200
into play

1093
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,120
spend time considering what tasks best

1094
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,840
align with the strategic direction of

1095
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,039
your team

1096
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,279
what things will move the needle the

1097
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,840
most in the direction it needs to go

1098
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,640
then after that develop your own list of

1099
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,360
prioritized

1100
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,640
prioritized tasks and present it to your

1101
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,799
your boss or your leader

1102
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,640
in a tactful manner as your own action

1103
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,000
plan you offer to take charge of getting

1104
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,919
these things done

1105
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,279
but be ready to justify why did you

1106
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,919
prioritize these things the way that you

1107
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,080
did it

1108
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,200
so in summary here you look for

1109
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,279
opportunities to help

1110
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,399
solve problems the team is facing also

1111
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,240
look for chances to

1112
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,559
improve the culture of good

1113
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,360
communication within your organization

1114
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,120
make it okay to say i don't know and be

1115
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,120
cognizant of communicating up and down

1116
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,479
the chain of command make sure people

1117
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,199
have situational awareness where they

1118
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
need it

1119
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,399
all right our final section is

1120
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,679
approaching the mission we've defined

1121
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,439
the larger strategic goal

1122
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,960
a tactical mission we've got everyone

1123
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,880
moving in the same direction

1124
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,640
we've assembled our team and now it's

1125
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,360
time to take action and accomplish the

1126
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,960
objectives

1127
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,719
this is where the project life life

1128
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,399
cycle comes into play

1129
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,000
and that is on the screen there

1130
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,479
communicating intent planning

1131
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,919
preparation execution and review so

1132
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,000
talking about communicating intent

1133
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,679
as we touched on in the first section

1134
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,200
communicating intent is the combination

1135
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,440
of the purpose or the why

1136
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,120
along with the desired in-state or goal

1137
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,080
uh when we communicate this it serves

1138
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,000
two purposes

1139
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,639
one we get faster improved decision

1140
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,720
making for uh for your operators

1141
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,000
if everyone understands the real intent

1142
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,200
the mission they can more easily make

1143
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,279
judgment calls about

1144
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,120
what risks what risks are worth taking

1145
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,360
which aren't when do i need to go to

1146
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,479
my leadership to ask for help or

1147
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,719
permission

1148
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,080
you also build a hive my mentality we

1149
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,760
call this the board framework

1150
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,439
if we have a shared mental model we can

1151
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,440
anticipate our teammates actions and

1152
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,039
prepare and respond accordingly by going

1153
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,880
into planning what are we trying to

1154
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,240
achieve when we talk about planning for

1155
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,760
a red team engagement

1156
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,440
when you start playing you were trying

1157
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,600
to explore the ways in which you might

1158
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,360
achieve that desire and state you also

1159
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,840
want to account for contingencies that

1160
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,080
we might encounter during operation

1161
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,199
for example obviously this is a really

1162
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,039
cut down version but

1163
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,440
in this test we're going to focus on

1164
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,679
initial access via fishing

1165
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,600
what are the ways we might go about this

1166
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,720
in terms of contingencies what processes

1167
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,120
do we put in place

1168
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,720
if we get caught this is a really great

1169
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,840
opportunity to get input from the team

1170
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,039
on how you're going to solve these

1171
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,720
challenges and to

1172
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,039
delegate some of these planning pieces

1173
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,960
to to your team members

1174
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,799
once a plan has been designed it's

1175
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,279
critical that everyone knows the entire

1176
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,760
plan

1177
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,440
specifically their role in that plan on

1178
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,120
your screen here you see marine standing

1179
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,720
around a train model

1180
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,639
this is a really common tool used in

1181
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,000
operation planning and it's nice because

1182
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,840
you can visualize

1183
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,679
an entire area of operations in one

1184
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,399
place but a change you need

1185
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,880
to consider from redtme is in red

1186
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,638
teaming

1187
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,320
you don't have the full view of the

1188
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,839
train your view of the train you're

1189
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,040
operating on is going to develop as the

1190
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,040
engagement progresses

1191
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,079
so your plan needs to account for this

1192
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,359
process of

1193
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,960
generating a broader plan for the

1194
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,480
engagement then having more detailed

1195
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,119
phase of planning so that's going to be

1196
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,719
conducted

1197
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,399
as new information is gathered once you

1198
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,319
have your initial planning done

1199
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,000
there's several facets of preparation

1200
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,760
that are important for good execution

1201
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,440
but the one i think that has probably

1202
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,639
the greatest impact from engagement

1203
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,879
engagement and that is standard

1204
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,560
operating procedures these give a team a

1205
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,000
baseline from which to operate

1206
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,440
now i've noticed that sometimes this

1207
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,159
concept gets a little bit of resistance

1208
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,839
because

1209
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,679
people don't like the idea of feeling

1210
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,320
restricted or being told how to do

1211
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,159
things

1212
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,000
it's true that creating a high quality

1213
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,520
consistent operation across the team

1214
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,679
may require members give up a little bit

1215
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,560
of just doing things however they want

1216
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,240
to do them

1217
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,839
but on reflection a good better

1218
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,720
operating procedure should be

1219
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,078
like a lego brick of team agreed upon

1220
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,598
best operating practices

1221
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,520
when you fit them all together in

1222
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,800
different ways you can build really cool

1223
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,960
stuff with relative ease instead of

1224
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,560
having to recreate a new logo brick for

1225
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,359
every time you want to add something on

1226
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,400
an example of this in in practice is the

1227
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,078
marine corps has

1228
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,599
a lot of standard operating procedures

1229
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,680
as i'm sure you can imagine

1230
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,880
a military favorite but one common

1231
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,000
element in the report

1232
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,839
is a squad a squad has a leader a squad

1233
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
trains to do things like

1234
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,240
direct fire on a designated target and

1235
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,440
they also train how to adjust fire onto

1236
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,160
a new target

1237
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,640
and how this is done is all documented

1238
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,879
in

1239
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,839
sops somewhere in lots of books and

1240
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,760
field manuals

1241
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,599
and that's really important because

1242
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,280
everyone knows exactly what the steps

1243
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,280
are that lets them work together

1244
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,119
imagine that squad leader is instructing

1245
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,800
that squad to adjust rightful fire from

1246
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,960
target one to target two

1247
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,160
without a sort of agreed-upon standard

1248
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,680
that would be a really dangerous and

1249
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,598
ineffective process

1250
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,118
but with training in sops the squad can

1251
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,960
be agile and effective in these

1252
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,880
these types of high stress circumstances

1253
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,520
in the red team world these sops take on

1254
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,359
a different form that play the same role

1255
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,880
for example let's say your team does a

1256
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,720
lot of phishing part of their initial

1257
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,400
access or maybe they're very frequently

1258
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,000
standing up c2 servers

1259
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,520
in both cases it's really important you

1260
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,119
have standard for

1261
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,560
how are these servers going to be set up

1262
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,760
and how are they going to be configured

1263
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,599
because you want to ensure that the

1264
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,119
servers are secure and effective for

1265
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,720
whatever their intended purpose is

1266
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,480
this also prevents operators from having

1267
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,919
to invent new server configs every time

1268
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,400
they go through this process which can

1269
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,400
be

1270
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,560
time consuming and also at least more

1271
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,320
more places for people to make errors

1272
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,839
having the standardized and documented

1273
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,880
creates seamlessness in your operation

1274
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,640
between gigs

1275
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,960
increases the team consistency and

1276
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,920
quality and with that i'm going to pass

1277
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,400
it over to

1278
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,760
tom so i moved into the execution

1279
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,760
portion of the engagement

1280
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,839
and here it's important to remember that

1281
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,800
communication is absolutely vital

1282
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,279
especially if you're

1283
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,800
part of a remote team no one enjoys

1284
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,000
working with that guy that you have to

1285
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,160
go and pester

1286
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,680
for status updates and that can happen

1287
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,319
with red teaming where people disappear

1288
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,480
for maybe

1289
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,720
days at a time because they're building

1290
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,440
a payload they're chasing some thread

1291
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,078
that might lead to remote code execution

1292
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,000
so establish upfront say hey six hours

1293
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,400
from now let's reconvene let's check our

1294
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,960
progress kind of detach figure out where

1295
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,880
we need to allocate our resources next

1296
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
where you can try to automate your

1297
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,320
actions so

1298
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,839
we utilize things like web hooks so if

1299
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,320
you're using things like teams

1300
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,359
or slack right into your scripts thing

1301
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,400
you know whatever whatever you're

1302
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,759
working on if you're deploying

1303
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,160
infrastructure if you get a shell

1304
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,920
whatever it may be if some event occurs

1305
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,920
push that to your central communication

1306
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,280
platform so everybody can stay up to

1307
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,040
date on what you're doing

1308
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,440
one of the important lessons i learned

1309
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,160
early in my career was to document as

1310
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,240
you go

1311
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,440
so i've been on engagements where i find

1312
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,680
something interesting

1313
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,520
and then i dig into it and then i pick

1314
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,480
my head up and it's six hours later and

1315
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,800
i've jumped through

1316
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,680
i have jumped through five systems i've

1317
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,720
compromised a bunch of

1318
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,078
accounts and i didn't document any of it

1319
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,480
and now i have to go back and write a

1320
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,520
report and that's extremely

1321
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,359
difficult to do so document the ip

1322
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,960
addresses the host names the accounts

1323
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,119
that you compromise the systems that you

1324
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,440
touched what artifacts did you drop

1325
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,119
where the hashes of those artifacts

1326
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,040
things that you'll have to report on

1327
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,520
later and also things that might help

1328
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,560
you

1329
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,359
in your attack cycle that if your pacing

1330
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,599
allows

1331
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,880
try to write the report as you go and

1332
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,440
that's something that's it's difficult

1333
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,720
to do

1334
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,400
and some that takes discipline to

1335
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,839
actually get into your workflow it can

1336
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,560
be very rewarding especially it helps

1337
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,400
you identify

1338
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,320
gaps so if you realize you're missing a

1339
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,119
screenshot and i was taking one of john

1340
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,280
strand's

1341
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,640
sans classes and john on if he's on the

1342
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
talk but maybe he can keep me honest

1343
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,960
here

1344
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,240
one of the things he taught us was when

1345
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,520
you get into a new environment

1346
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,520
don't try to think of it like you're

1347
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,640
trying to to hack a system think about

1348
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,280
it as an information

1349
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,640
collection exercise you want to learn as

1350
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,480
much as you can

1351
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,839
about the environment because we as

1352
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,680
humans are good

1353
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,040
at pattern recognition there's times

1354
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,200
where i find a piece of data

1355
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,880
on day one or day two of engagement and

1356
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,720
then i don't know exactly what to do

1357
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,320
with it yet so i hang on to it and then

1358
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,359
as i progress maybe i get towards the

1359
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,520
end of my engagement

1360
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,200
i'm looking for that last piece to push

1361
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,119
me over the edge

1362
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,200
and then if i've documented it well i

1363
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,240
can go back and reference that data i

1364
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,319
see that pattern

1365
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,000
and i can extrapolate out from there and

1366
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,119
maybe that will hit me or allow me to

1367
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,560
hit my objective

1368
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,920
automate things like setting up your

1369
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,520
command line logging make sure you're

1370
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,440
recording all your web logs

1371
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,599
you want to be in a position where it

1372
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,200
can if a client asks you for that kind

1373
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,920
of data maybe you're doing deconfliction

1374
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,520
or something like that

1375
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,359
where you can provide that stuff you do

1376
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,759
not want to learn that lesson the hard

1377
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,680
way

1378
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,960
even the most savvy leaders can get

1379
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,279
overwhelmed as

1380
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,200
information changes and as circumstances

1381
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,160
change if you try to tackle too many

1382
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,680
problems at once

1383
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,440
chances are all of your efforts are

1384
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,720
going to fail so i have a plan in place

1385
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,000
that's prepared for those likely

1386
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,240
contingencies that might pop

1387
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,320
up so identify the highest priority risk

1388
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,799
and focus your attention on that task

1389
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,440
till it's complete or at least has solid

1390
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,960
momentum

1391
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,560
and then move on to the next high

1392
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,960
priority task and then

1393
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,839
lastly just by nature of red teaming it

1394
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,400
carries a lot of

1395
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,839
inherent risk so you know driving and

1396
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,599
executing a payload on the system or

1397
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,599
touching a production application

1398
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,720
can be dangerous and the key to remember

1399
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,480
here is that

1400
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,720
you want the risk that your operators

1401
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,000
take to align with the objective of the

1402
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,240
mission and not necessarily

1403
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,200
to their own personal curiosity so to

1404
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,560
give an example

1405
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,480
what if you're on engagement where you

1406
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,480
come across maybe a legacy web

1407
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,720
application sitting in production

1408
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,160
and maybe you want to inject into

1409
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,359
applications process memory maybe you

1410
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,200
can pull out some

1411
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,040
sessions that are sitting there or maybe

1412
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,078
some credentials that are in there

1413
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,759
would that be cool yeah maybe does it

1414
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,760
is that the best path to actually get

1415
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,520
you closer to achieving your objective

1416
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,599
well maybe not if you take that

1417
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,200
application that legacy application down

1418
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,800
one that might expose your position on

1419
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,319
the network two it's probably gonna

1420
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,599
impact your customer what does that say

1421
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,880
to their bottom line

1422
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,319
what is that gonna do for the

1423
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,319
relationship that you've built and

1424
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,560
fostered with that customer for years

1425
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,319
so remember to be professional remember

1426
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,640
the team's overall goal

1427
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,400
and to operate with integrity and one of

1428
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,839
the last pieces in the life cycle

1429
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,839
and one of the most important is the

1430
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,680
review process and if i have a chance to

1431
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,040
talk about greg maddox i'm going to talk

1432
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,040
about greg maddox so

1433
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,480
for those of you familiar he is a hall

1434
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,359
of fame pitcher he has four cell young

1435
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,040
awards he has

1436
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,880
18 gold gloves still a major league

1437
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,319
baseball record he pitched for the

1438
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,760
braves through their run of 14

1439
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,640
consecutive division titles throughout

1440
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,160
the 90s

1441
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,759
and a handful of other teams throughout

1442
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,000
his career he got the nickname

1443
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,200
the professor and it was partially

1444
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,720
because of these kind of

1445
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,240
goofy glasses he would sometimes wear

1446
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,680
when he pitched it was mostly because

1447
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,319
when he went out there to pitch every

1448
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,759
fifth day

1449
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,520
it was like he was putting on a pitching

1450
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,800
clinic and he could teach it's like he

1451
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,759
was teaching everyone else you know this

1452
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,079
is how you do it

1453
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,160
but it was also partially because greg

1454
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,200
maddox used this really intensive review

1455
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,319
process

1456
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,200
so after an outing he would sit down and

1457
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,800
he would look at

1458
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,520
images and videos like this and you'd

1459
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,280
say okay i'm landing about five stride

1460
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,040
lengths in front of the rubber my chest

1461
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,400
is out over a bent front knee i brought

1462
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,640
my chest to the glove

1463
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,520
kept my shoulder in so my head doesn't

1464
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,040
pull off

1465
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,720
and i'm going to throw this two-seam

1466
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,759
fastball so it breaks back in over the

1467
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,759
outside corner

1468
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,359
and he would take these look at these

1469
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,960
actions and look at the results he sat

1470
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,440
down with his catcher and his pitching

1471
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,520
coach

1472
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,720
and even other pictures on the staff and

1473
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,480
they would look at

1474
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,759
their approach what was working and what

1475
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,319
wasn't

1476
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,000
now his pitching coach leah mazzoni said

1477
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,800
yeah he was called the professor

1478
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,240
and on the fifth day he would show that

1479
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,880
but on those four days

1480
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,919
in between starts he was a student of

1481
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,839
the game

1482
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,440
he was analyzing how all the other

1483
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,799
pitchers were approaching hitters and

1484
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,640
how they were getting their outs

1485
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,079
they would analyze the strategies and

1486
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,160
tactics that were working them weren't

1487
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,240
so this is what a guy did

1488
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,000
at the pinnacle of the sport he even

1489
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,919
though this talent guidance that level

1490
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,359
his yearning just to keep improving

1491
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,800
himself is what kept him there

1492
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,400
so how do we apply that in a red team

1493
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,560
sense we utilize something called after

1494
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,920
action reviews or aars it's a term that

1495
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,040
we've borrowed from the military just

1496
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,880
like red teaming

1497
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,880
and they're often overlooked but it's

1498
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,400
just as critical and the idea behind it

1499
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,319
is kind of what patrick said earlier

1500
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,760
about building a shared mental model

1501
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,000
the outcome of this is to hopefully

1502
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,920
bring new hires up to speed quicker and

1503
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,240
eliminate tribal knowledge

1504
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,760
so the idea is you get everyone execute

1505
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,720
on the engagement to come together and

1506
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,920
you work through the engagement

1507
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,399
chronologically you know here are all

1508
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,000
the

1509
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,319
big decisions we made here the big

1510
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,480
actions we took and you let the people

1511
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,599
actually did the work lead that

1512
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,440
conversation

1513
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,520
and you focus on improvements for the

1514
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,280
next mission for these environments you

1515
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,160
twitch off seniority you switch on

1516
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,880
humility

1517
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,560
and you aim for high candor the

1518
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,480
questions you ask are

1519
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,078
what was the expected outcome and what

1520
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,440
was the actual outcome

1521
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,200
if there was a difference between those

1522
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,319
two why was there a difference and

1523
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,720
explore that

1524
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,319
ask yourself what went wrong and why and

1525
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,399
what went right and why

1526
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,160
if something went wrong why did it go

1527
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,599
wrong and how can you improve upon that

1528
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,520
for the next iteration

1529
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,720
if something went right is there some

1530
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,160
pattern in theirs that you can

1531
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,959
extrapolate out and apply to other

1532
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,040
processes

1533
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,240
and then a little red team flare to this

1534
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,000
throughout the course of engagement did

1535
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,399
you write any tools did you develop or

1536
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,920
modify any ttps as part of it if so

1537
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,440
let's contribute those back to our you

1538
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,800
know our internal code repositories

1539
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,240
let's write a blog post let's put

1540
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,440
something on our internal wiki now i

1541
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,439
know i've been in a position

1542
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,040
maybe you guys have too where you come

1543
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,640
into a new environment

1544
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,480
and you're talking with the other guys

1545
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,359
in team and you start hearing this lingo

1546
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,960
being thrown around

1547
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,400
they're referencing tools that you've

1548
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,079
maybe never heard of

1549
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,760
and they're acting and operate in a way

1550
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,200
that just doesn't make sense to you

1551
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,880
and you realize that there was this kind

1552
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,118
of tribal knowledge that existed

1553
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,319
before you got there but if you have

1554
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,640
this repository

1555
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,240
of aars these members can go look at

1556
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,839
this repository and they see a tool

1557
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,439
reference that go okay

1558
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,040
the genesis of this tool was from this

1559
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,920
engagement two years ago

1560
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,160
the context of it was this and it was to

1561
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,400
combat this specific technology

1562
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,839
now you understand why they operate the

1563
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,680
way they do and it can be

1564
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,119
and help those newcomers come up to the

1565
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,879
standard that you've set

1566
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,720
so key takeaways from this last section

1567
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,119
if you have members of your team that

1568
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,520
seem

1569
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,400
a little more critical of leadership or

1570
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,759
the mission

1571
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,760
or if you see that they're just not

1572
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,200
invested in what's going on

1573
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,960
chances are they might not have been

1574
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,839
involved in the planning process so try

1575
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,440
to get them involved

1576
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,520
give them even if it's just a small

1577
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,839
little piece let them take ownership of

1578
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,599
that

1579
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,279
it allows them to kind of it satisfies

1580
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,200
that kind of natural craving we have as

1581
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,400
humans to have some autonomy and control

1582
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,399
over what we're doing

1583
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,160
and allows them to buy in a little more

1584
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,920
secondly if you don't have

1585
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,078
playbooks create them and if you do have

1586
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,920
playbooks continue to develop them

1587
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,839
and this was a concept that really hit

1588
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,400
home with me when i was listening to

1589
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,520
carlos perez's derbycon 2016 talk called

1590
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,839
thinking purple

1591
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,160
and in that talk he mentions that

1592
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,839
organizations that don't have playbooks

1593
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,319
and don't develop them they contribute

1594
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,319
to that culture of tribal knowledge

1595
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,000
and it makes you dependent upon those

1596
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,319
senior people that have developed the

1597
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,280
tools and ttps that your team uses

1598
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,960
and then lastly find the time to review

1599
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,400
the actions and the results of those

1600
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,440
actions from your engagements conduct

1601
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,839
those aars

1602
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,800
even if it's just a half hour or an hour

1603
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,000
and you don't necessarily need the

1604
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,520
leaders to be present you need the

1605
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,200
people that operate engagement there

1606
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,800
this will add significant value to those

1607
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,560
new team members and bring everyone up

1608
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,920
to that same standard so what makes a

1609
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,799
red team effective well it's a

1610
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,079
combination of

1611
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,680
all the things that patrick and i have

1612
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,720
been talking about the last hour but if

1613
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,279
we had to boil it down

1614
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,200
to one word or one idea we'd say it's

1615
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,480
culture you want to build a culture that

1616
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,279
shares vulnerability

1617
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,800
and builds safety establishes purpose

1618
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,280
exercises discipline

1619
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,560
and takes ownership and if you beacon

1620
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,400
these principles

1621
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,839
others will follow and your team will be

1622
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,480
more effective here's a list of

1623
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,640
references

1624
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,760
feel free to screenshot that if you want

1625
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,359
also post this in

1626
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,839
discord and with that i'd like to thank

1627
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,839
you all come out to the virtual talk
