1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,550
bryce is from rendition more happy to

2
00:00:05,229 --> 00:00:08,679
say that rendition is a sister company

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,769
to black hills information security they

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,210
also do a lot of sock really if you're

5
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:15,099
looking for a good defensive company

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,980
kind of managed look at your logs and

7
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:20,289
detect the tax rendition is fantastic

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,599
and then this particular presentation i

9
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:23,919
was a little bit sad whenever I read the

10
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:25,509
write-up for this particular well I'll

11
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:27,849
just give you a heads up breaking into

12
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:29,710
banks like a boss breaking into banks I

13
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:32,200
think is one of the most exciting things

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,730
in pen testing when you do it for the

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,219
first couple of times but after about

16
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,078
the 15th or 20th Bank he starts getting

17
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:39,489
a little bit scared and then anything

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,590
beyond that you just want to curl up

19
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:42,879
under your bed and hide so to help

20
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,140
people get to the point where they're

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,329
curling up and hiding under their breath

22
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,620
beds Bryce is gonna take us and talk

23
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,539
about how we can get to that level of

24
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,339
paranoia so take it away sir

33
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,330
again and well we'll get into that but

34

US Navy I was a CT Intel guy I know it's

83
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,399
an oxymoron now being in the military

84
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,109
and the military Intel and and then and

85

then just me it's just it's yeah it's

86
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,340

whatever I'm not doing these talks I

91
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,519
like the camp like motorcycles doing DIY

92
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,079
stuff and then and then breaking into

93
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,670
your office that's one of my one of my

94
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:16,220
favorite things to do so I'm with a

95
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,708
rendition InfoSec that's the twitter

96
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,030
handle up there so so like John said we

97
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,180
do with digital forensics instant

98
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,250
response we do obviously Red Team and

99
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,049
pin testing as well audience s-mint

100
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,690
straining sacraments whirring all that

101
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:32,030
fun stuff and then we're MSSP 24 by 7

102
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,700
sock in Augusta Georgia our headquarters

103
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,290
and then there is our ambulance that

104
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,670
attacking macaque face that's that's

105
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,010
real that's not photoshopped that is

106
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,500
actually a rolling cybersecurity

107
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,560
Enhancement unit so it's pretty fun we

108
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,120
try to bring it out to a couple cons and

109
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,829
if you have a good time run CTF out of

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,420
it it's really cool so where we go

111
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,950
together talking about so this kind of

112
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,600
the overview we're gonna be talking

113
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,850
about physical security and and pin

114
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,829
testing what it is why it's important

115
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,599
especially to me but not only myself

116
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:01,910
right being a cyber security

117
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,828
professional here but also to to our

118
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,420
clients and then also you as a stake

119
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:07,370
holder where you might be invested in

120
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,649
this company right the super important

121
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,090
has some common misconceptions so as

122
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,130
I've been doing this as a professional

123
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,569
I've come across some things right I've

124
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,969
come across some people that don't

125
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,769
believe I do what I do or I can't

126
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,260
believe how I did it or just flat-out

127
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,330
deny it or don't know how I did it right

128
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,090
so so you're gonna go over a couple of

129
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,260
those things really really fun and then

130
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,770
and then I'm going to teach you guys

131
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,139
basically how to do it

132
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,539
how to understand this physical

133
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,789
intesting art if you will because it's

134
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,440
definitely not science right and how to

135
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:40,770
understand it how to do it yourself

136
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,840
and to apply why legally if you if you

137
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,060
do this don't do this don't do this

138
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,609
illegally there is a certain point where

139
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,680
you get into some some illegal areas

140
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,300
there's some some lessons learned what

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,039
I've learned along the way kind of what

142
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,190
I've changed in my ways have gone about

143
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,900
breaking into two buildings in just kind

144
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,750
of learning from from however many I've

145
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,479
done along the way

146
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,250
and then how to stop me obviously if you

147
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,990
can take anything from this talk it's

148
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,850
that it's that slide right there is how

149
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,530
to prevent someone from getting into

150
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,900
your building because it's sometimes

151
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,270
just it's just super easy for me to get

152
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,969
in and it's as easy for me to get in as

153
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,310
it would be easy for one of our clients

154
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,230
to be able to put something in place and

155
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,060
basically prevent me from giving it and

156
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,010
then we're gonna go over some frequently

157
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,800
asked questions and then we're gonna get

158
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,870
into two questions well Rob joy said it

159
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,730
best don't assume a crack is too small

160
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,400
to be noticed or too small to be

161
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,350
exploited well run networks make our job

162
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,419
hard whenever I do my physical pin

163
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,270
testing just like I know we have hackers

164
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,979
you know our keyboard guys I'm doing it

165
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,930
the exact same way if I find something

166
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,640
small that low hanging fruit something

167
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,230
that someone says oh there's no way

168
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,550
they're gonna actually do that and they

169
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,380
don't do anything about it that's the

170
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,300
way I'm getting it right so you just

171
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,820
want to make sure you're constantly

172
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,050
checking up on these things because you

173
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,719
know just never take it for granted

174
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,640
never get complacent and adversaries

175
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,890
going to take care take advantage of any

176
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,870
opportunity that they have try to your

177
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,729
physical assessment to define it

178
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,830
physical pin test is to measure the

179
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,409
strength of existing physical security

180
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,240
controls and uncover their weaknesses

181
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,710
before bad actors are able to discover

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,390
them or exploit them so what are we

183
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,969
doing we're doing a B&E right we're just

184
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,830
breaking into a building on in my case

185
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,410
it's legal right what we get paid to do

186
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,090
however it doesn't matter if I can get

187
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,030
into a building right it doesn't matter

188
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,739
if I can steal certain things and your

189
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,059
server and all this stuff and and that's

190
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,220
all well and good but at the end of the

191
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,950
day how can I use this information to

192
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,110
basically better our clients to say hey

193
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,300
this is how I did it this is what you

194
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,100
can do to prevent that and that's the

195
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,560
goal because we don't want bad actors to

196
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,650
be able to do that through story I had a

197
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,330
client contact me or contact us not too

198
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,070
long ago and they were like hey guys I

199
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,340
just want to be thank you for for doing

200
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,710
that that physical pen we actually had

201
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,200
some individuals try to get into our

202
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,299
building intentionally to do who knows

203
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,729
what right and and luckily because of

204
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,220
what rendition did because we did a pin

205
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:09,979
test before then the security team was

206
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,410
able to stop them and prevent who knows

207
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,740
what right so so definitely definitely a

208
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,720
great great thing

209
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,890
so why is it important so it's super

210
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,260
important to me I'm super passionate

211
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,900
about it there's like an old wide stale

212
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,090
old story out here especially around

213
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,859
cybersecurity cons where there's a CTF

214
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,289
right let's take a CTF I know we have

215
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,720
one going on here say we have team a on

216
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,100
one side of the room and team B and then

217
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,510
you have the moderators obviously in the

218
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,280
center with it with the server sitting

219
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,430
there on the table and they go like okay

220
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,200
hey listen up you know team a and Team B

221
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,400
you guys basically need to figure out

222
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,140
whether vulnerabilities are in the

223
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,349
server and completely own the server

224
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,360
completely own the data right so then

225
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,830
team a just starts hacking away all

226
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,240
right they just start in a plugin way

227
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,950
see what vulnerabilities are there we'll

228
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,930
open pour its protocols all that fun

229
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,950
stuff any any hackers in the room this

230
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,300
is what you guys are gonna be doing

231
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,940
you're just guys just gonna be hacking

232
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,370
away right and then team B kind of looks

233
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,260
over and they take a second and I go you

234
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,400
know what you just said we have to own

235
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:12,210
the data right like we just have to have

236
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,679
the data and that's just it right so TV

237
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,000
gets up and they just walk over to the

238
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,890
server and they unplug it and then they

239
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,290
take that server and they sit back down

240
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:21,810
right so who actually owns the data now

241
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,680
right it's not team a because they can't

242
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,050
connect to it anymore

243
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,550
Team B has the data right and that's

244
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,190
what we're talking about is is because

245
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,230
that that physical part was overlooked

246
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,929
it's still it's still the same thing

247
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,719
right your hackers can definitely get

248
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:39,000
into networks and get that data but what

249
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,250
if I can just walk in to the front door

250
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,919
bypass security or whatever measures you

251
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,480
have in place take that server right and

252
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,880
then now I have the data and that was so

253
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,010
much easier right and quicker yeah and

254
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,060
sometimes cheaper my personal opinion I

255
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,180
think it's one of the most one of the

256
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,160
most overlooked areas of our industry

257
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,680
there's some common misconceptions right

258
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,329
so so I actually I actually developed

259
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,949
this talk there's a lot of great

260
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,870
physical pen testers out there I'm sure

261
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,270
you guys know of a couple deviant he's a

262
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,190
great you know great physical pen tester

263
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,170
but you know I heard a lot of these

264
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,910
talks and a lot of them are like oh yeah

265
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,560
we got into this building and then we

266
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,810
you know picked these locks and then we

267
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,339
you know open the safe and we use the

268
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,199
elevators to do all these things and

269
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,490
which is great and definitely an

270
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,160
important part of the physical pen

271
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,230
testing aside but one thing I did like

272
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,600
didn't see and I'm sure it's out there

273
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,160
but one

274
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,630
I didn't see was hey how are these

275
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,180
people getting into the building right

276
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,910
what is the process of being able to say

277
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,920
okay I know I'm gonna be coming in

278
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,050
disguised as whoever or I know I'm going

279
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,389
to go speak to that guard or I know I'm

280
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,758
gonna be coming in at a certain time

281
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:44,319
that's very calculated how did like what

282
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,639
is the process there right

283
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:47,620
so I basically came up with my own

284
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,730
process where we're going to be talking

285
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,490
about reconnaissance surveillance

286
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,870
Canaries using these things to make a

287
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,060
process where you say okay no matter

288
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,759
what kind of building it is whether it's

289
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,920
a huge skyscraper mom-and-pop radio

290
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,690
shack rest in peace or anything else

291
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,579
right you're gonna be able to get in

292
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,829
some somehow so what does that process

293
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:07,180
getting up to that door you know before

294
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:09,099
you start doing all your lock picking

295
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,050
and fun stuff like that some other

296
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,490
common misconceptions right I've had

297
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,889
this one from a client where they say

298
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,480
hey hey Bryce there's you know how about

299
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:18,339
it feel free to do your do your physical

300
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,680
pin test you know you're not gonna get

301
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:23,139
past the front desk right there's no way

302
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,420
we have lasers we have biometric so we

303
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:26,709
have 24 by 7 security guards the roving

304
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,769
round alarm system

305
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,989
we even have pressure sensitive floors

306
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,939
right and and even we know you're fat so

307
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,519
you're not going to get past those right

308
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:38,230
so I say okay challenge accepted

309
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,060
right guys I'm going to show you for the

310
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,160
first time ever actual photographic

311
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,880
evidence of how I get past all these

312
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,170
measures and in particular the the

313
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,560
pressure-sensitive pads

314
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,219
hope you guys are ready there you go so

315
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,010
that's me

316
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,900
okay so that's not me but that's a bet

317
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,670
yeah okay that's Tom Cruise in Mission

318
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,430
Impossible he's an actor but I've

319
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:04,339
actually never done this but it's uh you

320
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,609
know it's actually a lot like a lot

321
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,380
easier than this right so so yeah what's

322
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,840
another one I've had this one you were

323
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,730
lucky right I've had where they say you

324
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,380
know you have yet inside knowledge so

325
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,120
you must have talked to someone you must

326
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,610
know someone at a company that told you

327
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,460
how to get in or gave you a badge or

328
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,070
something I've had one one one client

329
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,720
where I texted him I think that night or

330
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,360
something or a son of an email that

331
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,160
night I said hey I was able to get in no

332
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,480
problem and they they just flat-out

333
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,339
denied it there was like there's no way

334
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,100
you could have got in there's no way you

335
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,560
could have got in and and got out just

336
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,200
no way and so unfortunately you know I

337
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,479
had to send send a picture just to kind

338
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,250
of prove that and not not so fun but but

339
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,620
there's gonna be people that just you

340
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,780
know flat out deny it but what I did is

341
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,870
is I actually broke into your bank these

342
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,750
are actual companies you know huge

343
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:01,310
physical buildings roving guards federal

344
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:03,740
banks secured secured right locations

345
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,400
that where people just say hey yeah no

346
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,900
problem

347
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,140
there's no way someone's gonna break in

348
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,850
we're just gonna really focus on the

349
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,560
electronic that the the technical piece

350
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,210
of it will put all of our money on that

351
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,219
trying to prevent people from hacking in

352
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,260
and then we'll just hire some guards and

353
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,930
it'll be all good and me as a physical

354
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,360
confessor hey do that love it but but

355
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,750
obviously there's more to one story on

356
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,850
this

357
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,030
I literally I got into one of these

358
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:32,060
banks got up to the floor and there was

359
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:34,400
a computer sitting right there hide the

360
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,140
mouse unlocked right and that's always

361
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,209
fun right that's that's more fun than

362
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,130
finding the the sticky note with the

363
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,110
password on it which found quite a bit

364
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,089
of those but unlocked this film and

365
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,430
actually the the password was on on the

366
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:49,220
monitor to be fair on the unlock system

367
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,050
and then this system would have given me

368
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,440
access to basically I would I could have

369
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,689
put in my bank information put the

370
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,910
amount I wanted in and and hit send and

371
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,010
transfer it over to me and this is super

372
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,810
dangerous right but if you get you guys

373
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,580
understand that the severity here is

374
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,949
it's because they they saw

375
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:11,040
because the computer was behind a door

376
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,990
on this floor behind guards all this

377
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,490
stuff they didn't they'd even think to

378
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,470
lock the system number one and they

379
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,390
didn't even think to you know take the

380
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,040
password away who else would do this the

381
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:23,880
only people that can be on this floor

382
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:27,180
are authorized employees right so just a

383
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,130
little complacency there so how does how

384
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,939
do I do this right what's the what's the

385
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,950
kind of overarching method of how we do

386
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,560
this so so number one is going to be

387
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,450
observation so so what I do here is is

388
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,520
basically this is where I fly into the

389
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,380
city you know I have my address of the

390
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,660
building I need to go to I'm gonna be

391
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,970
doing obviously some some ascent right

392
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,880
I'm going to go on Google Google Maps

393
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,860
Google Street View and and look around

394
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,990
and see what I can find

395
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,490
right I'm also gonna be getting my cup

396
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,250
of coffee across the street at the

397
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,810
Dunkin Donuts and and looking at the

398
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,030
foot traffic people coming in people

399
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,619
coming out who are they how old are they

400
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,839
what do they look like what are they

401
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,180
wearing do they have a company like are

402
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,470
they the cleaning company does the

403
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,540
cleaning company use a different

404
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,850
entrance right where do the employees

405
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,459
Park is their parking garage that they

406
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,230
park maybe under under the building or

407
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,690
do they take public transportation I do

408
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,150
a lot of a lot of skyscrapers and like

409
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,910
downtown you know big downtown cities

410
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,040
sometimes if they have those underground

411
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,380
paths that go into a parking garage

412
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,180
underneath and so all these things

413
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,980
really come into play and I just

414
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,209
basically sit there and look back I

415
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,490
don't do anything except for just

416
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,050
observe right and as you can see in my

417
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,610
picture here I don't know if anyone

418
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,020
recognizes this picture but this is

419
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,520
actually from from home alone the old

420
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,470
movie home alone right and you have

421
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,880
Harry and Marv in a plumbing and heating

422
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,520
band which obviously they're not

423
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,930
plumbers or do any HVAC right and

424
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,460
they're in there sitting in the span and

425
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,800
and you know that scene where they're

426
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,560
like mars-like or sorry Harry

427
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,530
he's like at this time in ten seconds

428
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,900
this this this house the lights are

429
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,760
gonna come on right now right and then

430
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,770
he says right now so he obviously got

431
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,280
this Intel and he knows all everything

432
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,170
works

433
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,020
he knows who's out of town all this

434
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:15,569
stuff just from observing right and and

435
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,250
and because they're professional well I

436
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,700
say professional but they're bad guys

437
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,950
right

438
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,070
which moves into the second phase is the

439
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,360
reconnaissance right so what we do is

440
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,040
we're gonna do a little bit more active

441
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,480
active approach here right I'm going to

442
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,610
enter the building right I might enter

443
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,950
the building and just day-night see who

444
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,090
notices I'm going to see if someone says

445
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,490
you know hey what's your business here

446
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,680
or something like that obviously I'm

447
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,630
gonna have kind of I'm gonna expect to

448
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,609
be challenged I'm gonna have a cover in

449
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,830
which we'll get into all that here in a

450
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,600
second but you see who notices I'm gonna

451
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,310
be in the back maybe dumpster diving

452
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,140
right looking for some sensitive

453
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,790
documents and if there's a camera up

454
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,150
there I want to know how how quickly

455
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,339
someone might see me digging around and

456
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,650
then and then you know come challenge me

457
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,480
right maybe maybe they're not monitoring

458
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,250
the cameras I can spend hours back there

459
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,810
no one no one says anything no one comes

460
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,720
back there so I'm building this

461
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,310
basically just this profile of this

462
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,720
building saying okay you know what are

463
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,780
people noticing what do they not notice

464
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,550
that visitor badges right or employee

465
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,949
badges contractor badges visitor badges

466
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,870
you see people walking out of the

467
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,520
building with these just hanging can I

468
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,220
get a good enough picture in my mind

469
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,079
where I can kind of fake one that that's

470
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,690
one of the one of the ways I you know

471
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,700
kind of get I get into testing policies

472
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,230
and procedures so if I'm not trying to

473
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,230
find a badge and look at someone with a

474
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,610
badge and copy that or imitate that so I

475
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,410
can come in as a contractor or an

476
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,030
employee I'm gonna be testing their

477
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,610
policies right so one of the things I do

478
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:48,730
is I act as a delivery person I have

479
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,460
this this fake delivery form I come in

480
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,890
as like 1-800 flowers or whoever the

481
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,960
local flower company is I'll just buy

482
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,150
some cheap flowers or chocolates or

483
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,070
something I'll find someone through a

484
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,750
sense with your open source intelligence

485
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,520
you know LinkedIn or something like that

486
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,819
that works at that company and I'm gonna

487
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,770
deliver a you know a lucky person that

488
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,810
day I'm some flowers and some chocolates

489
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,129
right from an anonymous person but what

490
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,839
am I actually doing right I'm actually

491
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,240
going into the building this gives me

492
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,589
some at a proper cover to go into the

493
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,980
building where I have a reason to be

494
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,720
there

495
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,700
I might have paperwork to make it look

496
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,380
official and kind of back it up and then

497
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,450
I'm going to go up to the front desk or

498
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,150
maybe I'll try to just walk into the to

499
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:30,179
the to the delivery entrance right see

500
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,009
if that's unlock see if anybody notices

501
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,499
or I'll go through the regular employee

502
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,480
elevator see if anybody catches me or

503
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:39,059
says anything there and then if they do

504
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,100
or there's no way I can kind of get past

505
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,450
that stuff I'm obviously a check in with

506
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,158
the front desk and was it fun that's

507
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,450
gonna be well they're gonna look at it

508
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:47,610
and they're gonna say okay yeah that

509
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,369
person works here that person doesn't

510
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,049
you know they might say okay hey let me

511
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,639
call that person real quick what's their

512
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,470
protocol whenever visitors show up do

513
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,090
they call them do they email them do

514
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,159
they just say oh yeah go on the one

515
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,279
upstairs which is a great one by the way

516
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,369
um you know do they call a four digit

517
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,539
extension rather than seven digits right

518
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:08,158
so that could tell me okay they're

519
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:10,139
sitting in that building is they dial

520
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:12,210
four numbers right you can listen to it

521
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,769
or obviously look over the best to see

522
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,590
if but you know what they're typing do

523
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:18,509
they do they call ten digits right that

524
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,980
would be a cell phone number so so I

525
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:21,840
know if they have cell phones or if they

526
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,129
just have desk phones and and you'll see

527
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,889
where all this comes into play here in a

528
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:27,990
second but but that way I say okay I

529
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:29,939
know how they're processing visitors I

530
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,409
know their policies of how they do this

531
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,580
and their procedures and I'm gonna

532
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,669
figure out where that vulnerability is

533
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,199
and I'm gonna get right in there right

534
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:39,570
literally all right and then next is

535
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,970
final crap right so once I have my plan

536
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:44,700
of attack once I know and I do all this

537
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,740
research and poking and prodding I'm

538
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,200
gonna go okay I know what time of day

539
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,110
I'm going in because I know the guards

540
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,039
schedule I I did my delivery in the

541
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,229
morning

542
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,460
right and and this particular guard was

543
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,230
there or these three guards and I

544
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,659
remember their faces so I'm going to

545
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,909
wait doing my observation and I know

546
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:04,919
that two o'clock is whenever they do a

547
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,749
shift change right so after two is

548
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,279
whenever I can come in again those

549
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:10,529
people aren't going to notice me at all

550
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,490
right and obviously I can do glasses and

551
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:13,619
that kind of thing we'll get into

552
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,299
disguise here in a second but I'm gonna

553
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,668
build that plan of attack what time am i

554
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:20,850
coming in what what am I dressed as

555
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:23,190
right so so naturally one thing that

556
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,779
works beautifully is if you can find

557
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,970
through through open source intelligence

558
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:29,399
there is P there in an Internet service

559
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,230
provider and you disguise yourself as

560
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:34,529
that you create a fake badge

561
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:36,840
I love ATI as in I love using the cover

562
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:38,789
of ATT right I have me a fake AT&T badge

563
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,949
I'll dress in a dress up as business

564
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:43,109
casual and I'll have this cover story

565
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,890
that's just incredible I'll have fake

566
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:45,689
documents

567
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,670
and I'll just basically say you know

568
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,280
through a fake letterhead on their of

569
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,710
the company and I'll say hey you know

570
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,600
this company there they said that they

571
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,400
sent us a memo obviously we work for

572
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,689
them they said the Internet sound or the

573
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,090
networking sound there's a problem

574
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,770
whatever it is and I'm gonna go in a

575
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,750
certain time and can basically sell it

576
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,730
right and and I'm gonna make sure I have

577
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,760
this all down pat everything is

578
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,890
top-notch and and I have this plan and

579
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,280
then I'm gonna I'm gonna do it right

580
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:16,200
which goes to execution all right I'm

581
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,600
gonna execute it right I'm going to go

582
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,250
do it it is time to walk the walk right

583
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,719
so you have to sell yourself you have to

584
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,460
you have to blend in you don't want to

585
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,750
cause a scene unless that's part of like

586
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,890
you know the way you want to get in

587
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,840
which you know that's a whole nother

588
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,950
thing but I'm gonna blend in I'm gonna

589
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,169
pretend I'm supposed to be their

590
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,480
business casual that shows you know hey

591
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,220
this guy obviously you know he's a nice

592
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,990
dresser right and I know that sounds

593
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,380
silly but that kind of stuff comes into

594
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,060
play

595
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,640
does he take care of himself is he kept

596
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,530
these kind of things will basically make

597
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,930
a person like you more right with I'm

598
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,680
all dingy and you know maybe smelly or

599
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,210
something like that

600
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,790
obviously could be like hmm I don't know

601
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,230
right so so if you act like you're

602
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,470
supposed to be there and kind of look

603
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,210
like the typical employees that they see

604
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,760
their guards gonna be basically down a

605
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,860
little bit right basically be helpful

00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,240
kidding

653
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,529
I was like what can you show me up to

654
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,130
your server room he's like yeah not a

655
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:34,380
problem

656
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,690
that one's always always fun to tell

657
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,669
stuff there's there's tools and kind of

658
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,929
tech of you know the badging and

659
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:41,669
everything like that this is more the

660
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:42,690
human element you you have to serve it

661
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:44,970
you have to sell it

662
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,990
other people ask in experts yeah J Hamm

663
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,149
I worked with J him quite a bit

664
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,220
definitely knows I'm an extrovert

665
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:52,168
especially when I need to be so but you

666
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,450
know everyone everyone enjoys their kind

667
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:56,279
of alone time introvert kind of both

668
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,799
throw the headphones in and get to work

669
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,230
so just depends but but definitely

670
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,730
definitely more of an extrovert so there

671
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,039
are definitely introverts that do this

672
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,960
stuff and and they just basically become

673
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,809
an extrovert and it's just I mean heck

674
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,940
this next slide right here is those

675
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:13,799
acting skills right you know that gosh

676
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,990
we've seen so many actors where they're

677
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,059
just kind of off the off like they're

678
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,769
nuts right but then you put them in

679
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:22,320
front of a camera and all of a sudden

680
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:24,590
they are just off the wall yeah acting

681
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,360
and it taking profiles absolutely

682
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,370
absolutely right so so yes so let me let

683
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,320
me go over this right all right cover

684
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,580
story cover for action there's two

685
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,168
there's two kinds there's cover for

686
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,658
action and cover for status you got

687
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:38,309
anybody ever heard of those so so a

688
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,600
couple for a couple for action cover for

689
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:41,730
status there is a difference right so

690
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,709
cover for status is going to be the

691
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,990
status the reason why I'm there in the

692
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,929
first place right so in the example that

693
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:52,380
I brought up cover for status would be

694
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:54,899
myself as an AT&T contractor employee

695
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,630
I'm there to fix things right I'm there

696
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:59,850
to oh your network you know function

697
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,309
right there is a problem I need to get

698
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,678
in and get out I have a badge I have you

699
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:06,418
know all this all this fun stuff I need

700
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,309
to I need to get in there that's my

701
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,269
cover for status that's the reason why

702
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:12,158
I'm there right the cover fresh

703
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:14,049
a little bit different over actions a

704
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,809
little bit different because I'm going

705
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:20,259
into the building and then why are you

706
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:22,570
actually using a lockpick to get into

707
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:24,339
that door or why are you actually you

708
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,749
said you're going into the server room

709
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,918
but why are you going into the CEOs

710
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:30,489
office right

711
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,739
so as a as a malicious guy because I

712
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:35,259
have to be malicious whenever I'm doing

713
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:37,570
this um I have to have a reason why I'm

714
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:39,369
doing certain things every single thing

715
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,769
why I'm doing it why am i taking the

716
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:43,988
starck at the emergency staircase as

717
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:46,149
opposed to the elevator right why am I

718
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:47,829
going up to the floor a floor above

719
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:50,258
where I said I was actually going to go

720
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:55,809
now that is number number one let me

721
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:57,639
tell you I am the dumbest person when it

722
00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:00,759
comes to physical pin tests and what I

723
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:04,109
mean is is I act like the dumbest person

724
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:06,789
like if if my goal was to basically

725
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:09,639
distract someone right I'm gonna say

726
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:11,769
okay I my plan is to use directions

727
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:14,349
right and say hey I don't know where to

728
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:16,509
go to basically distract someone for a

729
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:18,549
long enough time so what I would do is I

730
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:20,469
would ask them directions over and over

731
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:22,209
and over and over again I would be like

732
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:23,559
wait you said three left's and then a

733
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:25,299
right and they would be like what are

734
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,599
you talking about dude I said you go

735
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:31,179
straight like that's it and mind you I

736
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:32,889
mean you use this everywhere right so

737
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:34,899
hey why are you on this why are you on

738
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:35,978
the floor that your document says you're

739
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:38,349
supposed to be on the 12th and on the

740
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:39,789
15th I'm so sorry I just pushed and

741
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,208
pushed the but I guess I push the wrong

742
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:43,209
button

743
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:45,789
I mean it's very simple but it's super I

744
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:49,929
mean it's just so funny because you just

745
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:52,089
can just being just acting dumb right

746
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:54,759
nobody bats an eye they're just like

747
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:56,139
this guy is just an idiot right and I'm

748
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,729
okay with people thinking thinking

749
00:25:56,139 --> 00:26:00,758
nominating it because then they try to

750
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:03,639
help you right I mean let me read some

751
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,450
of this so yeah yeah nobody nobody who

752
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:06,599
asked right

753
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,459
nobody cares a lot of the times people

754
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,559
people will just not even bat an eye and

755
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:13,029
they will just walk through the building

756
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,070
and and you're just trying to find

757
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:17,979
someone I remember I was looking around

758
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,450
trying to find oh you're kind of like a

759

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,030
into this building had a thing I was

763
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,520
doing my delivery right I didn't think

764
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,290
the delivery ploy would work I

765
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,200
definitely use that I know we I talked

766
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,659
about the delivery piece as you know

767
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,010
recon on where I'm doing kind of poking

768
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,350
and prodding right to see how their

769
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,850
policies are but I gotta be honest

770
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,399
whenever I pulled up to the building and

771
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:51,919
I had my my chocolates right and I was

772
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,710
ready to go with my delivery or my

773
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,440
delivery slip and all this stuff I see

774
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:01,070
that the delivery dock doors open hey

775
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,900
okay so cool I'm going to just walk

776
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,580
through that door right and then just

777
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,320
see how far I can get cuz hey I'm making

778
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,389
a delivery that's my cover for status

779
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,980
right and why am I going to the did this

780
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,020
door specifically that's my cover for

781
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,670
action right and if someone catches me I

782
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,290

00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,290
UPS truck or something delivering

788
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,720

cheap right some other supporting items

857
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,350
right especially whenever I'm talking

858
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:56,899
about Cobra for action cover for status

859
00:29:54,350 --> 00:30:00,529
so I carry uh so I got my wallet here

860
00:29:56,899 --> 00:30:02,299
okay and then you see I got a pin and I

861
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:05,120
got a flashlight and always carrying

862
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:07,129
with me I also have my wedding ring so

863
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,639
what I can do is if I need to plug a USB

864
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,960
into a system and obviously if I'm

865
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,970
depending on my cover right if I need to

866
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,890
plug in a USB to a system whenever I'm a

867
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,049
delivery guy because hey someone someone

868
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,909
let me in or you know let me tailgate or

869
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,710
the back door is open I need to have a

870
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:23,090
reason why I'm under this person's desk

871
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,460
especially if they're getting up to go

872
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,559
get some coffee and then I'm in there

873
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,720
plugging in something and then they come

874
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,789
back right and catch me in the act you

875
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,200
have to have a plan for that right so

876
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:35,270
that's gonna be my cover for action so

877
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,770
what is it right well I dropped my

878
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,629
wedding ring or I dropped one of these

879
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,460
items right here and I'm trying to find

880
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,010
it on your desk so I literally will take

881
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,390
it out I'll have my USB in my hand

882
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,940
and I'll take these items out and I'll

883
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,010
toss them under the desk and then and

884
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,810
then whatever I need to go back hey I

885
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,890
can't find my flashlight and you know

886
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,230
you know what the thing about a

887
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,850
flashlight is I need it to find things

888
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:59,270
right so that's why it's taking me so

889
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:02,030
long I mean the things you can just make

890
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:03,770
up and just be just be sillier or fun

891
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,260
someone mentioned that improv class

892
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:08,690
absolutely take acting you know acting

893
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,000
skills take it in improv class acting

894
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,770
class whatever it is just start talking

895
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,230
to people in an airport and a bar

896
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,030
obviously not right now with the virus

897
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,860
don't feel close to anyone you know but

898
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,629
stiff-arm um I don't you know don't get

899
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,429
it and and just be a great liar right

900
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,190
just be a great liar not not to your

901
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,990
significant other but yeah so all right

902
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,040
so fun fact right so kind of what we

903
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,510
were talking about a lot of these people

904
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,639
on here I thought you guys saying you

905
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:34,220
know hey be helpful all all that fun

906
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,470
stuff so 1969 scientists tested the

907
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,600
Benjamin Franklin effect right and found

908
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,790
that yes asking people for favors when

909
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,550
you strategically is a tool to get them

910
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:45,320
to like you more absolutely right and I

911
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,450
think we basically covered that is if

912
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,310
you ask somebody to help you out I love

913
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,780
playing the sympathy card right hey I

914
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,470
don't want to be here either it's 2:00

915
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,480
in the morning

916
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,950
you got the 24-hour guard there it's

917
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,810
2:00 in the morning they don't want to

918
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,130
deal with anything right and typically

919
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:01,669
the people that work the midnight shift

920
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:04,040
or like the ones that typically right

921
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,990
that's that's that's the crappier ship

922
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,600
right it's usually the lowest level

923
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,070
person that just got hired and they go

924
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,810
hey nothing's gonna happen during the

925
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,429
night time you know the CEO isn't gonna

926
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,320
walk by and challenge you and all that

927
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,240
stuff so you could just work the night

928
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,250
shift I love coming in during the night

929
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,440
shift right because they don't want to

930
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,990
lose their job I don't want to I don't

931
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,150
want to be there right I'm tired too

932
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,770
just help me out and they go okay hey no

933
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,740
problem and typically they'll give me a

934
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:33,170
badge right all too often all too often

935
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,930
all right another another great tool is

936
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:38,270
you know George W Bush George Bush gave

937
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:41,000
us a great tool here and it is confusion

938
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:42,740
patience and persistence this guy is my

939
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,110
hero when it comes to fiscal pin testing

940
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,470
because he is so confusing in this quote

941
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:50,600
and he just keeps on going he keeps on

942
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,810
chugging he knows he is butchering this

943
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,760
so bad but he keeps on truckin right and

944
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,990
and this is what you have to do you have

945
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,020
to confuse this person

946
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,940
much and and and be so persistent that

947
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,000
they just give up right whenever

948
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:07,040
whenever I went into a building one time

949
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,190
basically if your virtual sock from

950
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,840
another area they had to basically allow

951
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,270
me access right there the only people

952
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,428
that could allow me access and I sat

953
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:19,250
there for over two hours basically

954
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:20,780
asking for permission to the point and

955
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,400
obviously there's more stuff to it but

956
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,639
but long story short to the point where

957
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,980
the companies like they called me up and

958
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,500
they said I don't know who you are and I

959
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,570
don't care but you need to go and do

960
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,890
your thing and then get out like they

961
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,200
just got tired of dealing with and

962
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,300
because I was so persistent and annoying

963
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,490
and just confused the heck out of them

964
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,490
of what I was even doing there right

965
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:45,410
they just for whatever reason let me up

966
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,030
right and they just gave me access I

967
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,370
don't care what floors you need

968
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:53,780
have at it we don't care just hurry up

969
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:56,659
and get out of there okay perfect George

970
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,190
Bush with a channel right so yeah like I

971
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,809
said if you could challenge confuse them

972
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,250
hey yeah I didn't know I was supposed to

973
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:03,740
be on this floor sorry I'm actually

974
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,540
trying to look for this person we got

975
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,869

00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,918

981

986
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,550

987
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,659

988
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,520

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,879
of wave her off she leaves and then

991
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,668
whenever we come up to this other

992
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,069
person's desk we say you know what I'd

993
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:41,899

996
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,100
don't have our escort anymore I mean

997
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:49,909
it's brilliant right we don't have a

998
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,379
dress code anymore

999
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:53,119
she doesn't know what's going on

1000
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:54,649
everyone's confused and we're just

1001
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,119
roaming around now we just have to avoid

1002
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:56,509
that one lady that challenges us we're

1003
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,180
good to go

1004
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,670
alright so patience persistence it pays

1005
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:04,970
off ride the elevator we we rode the

1006
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,619
elevator for you know I don't know over

1007
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,109
an hour and a half two hours right just

1008
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:10,450
riding the elevator getting off

1009
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:11,799
following someone end right because

1010
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,140
people love to be helpful they love to

1011
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,300
open doors right so so write it on every

1012
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,650
single floor get off if someone starts

1013
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,510
looking over their shoulder you're like

1014
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,920
let me check my phone real quick and

1015
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,290
then wait for the next person to come in

1016
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,530
right so be be patient be persistent

1017
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:28,930
definitely helps right all right so some

1018
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,309
lessons learned right

1019
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,129
lessons learn whenever you do this whole

1020
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:34,809
test you might be the bad guy right like

1021
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,400
I said I've had I've had clients where

1022
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:38,800
they say no there's no way you got in I

1023
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,270
was sitting in front of you know several

1024
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,890
several of their employees and

1025
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,170
particularly the ones that are in charge

1026
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,819
of physical security and they were not

1027
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:49,329
pleased because they weren't aware of

1028
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:52,450
the bin test right and and and obviously

1029
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:55,000
my goal is to not have anyone lose their

1030
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,669
job ever right I am going to make sure

1031
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,140
that everything is in place right and

1032
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,520
the company's doing what they're

1033
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,290
supposed to be doing the policies and

1034
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,670
procedures right but there's gonna be

1035
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:06,130
people that blame you right hey you

1036
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,809
broke this door you broke this latch or

1037
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,910
something like that when when you didn't

1038
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:12,520
they're basically trying to figure out

1039
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,618
you know why you were so successful and

1040
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,910
and why you know they don't want to be

1041
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,740
blamed they don't want to lose their job

1042
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,540
right so you're gonna have some angry

1043
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,220
people there and just be aware of that

1044
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,660
and at the same time that's a meeting

1045
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,040
you know several people on the other

1046
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,240
side of the table who knew about the pin

1047
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,750
test they were loving it they were like

1048
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,220
oh man Bryce you did so good right a

1049
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,819
Google Streetview not always up to date

1050
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,770
right

1051
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:33,910
we've had several times where we will

1052
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,990
kind of scope out the building through

1053
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,670
through Google Streetview

1054
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,328
you know just be obviously you and your

1055
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:42,579
due diligence through through oset and

1056
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:44,770
basically see that the the building is

1057
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:46,450
covered in construction right and and

1058
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,190
they're working and and all that stuff

1059
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,558
and but then whatever you have to show

1060
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,280
up on site the building's complete and

1061
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,960
maybe there's a new restaurant

1062
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,180
downstairs that you didn't know about so

1063
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,079
you have to be flexible on that you know

1064
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,509
on that regard

1065
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,130
things change and then sometimes it's

1066
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,990
the opposite so I'm sure oh yeah I could

1067
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,579
I can definitely use this Dunkin Donuts

1068
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,750
that's in the lobby of this building and

1069
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:06,430
I can just kind of chill and drink

1070
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,900
coffee and then you show up and they

1071
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:10,240
destroy the Dunkin Donuts

1072
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,349
you know so you got to be flexible you

1073
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,879
got to have it you gotta have a plan

1074
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:15,640
there but sometimes it shows some

1075
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,710
interest in interesting things OSA is in

1076
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,569
particular with Google Streetview you

1077
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,059
know we had a client where they the

1078
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:23,950
Google camera or the you know the

1079
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:26,260
vehicle took a picture of their loading

1080
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,730
dock while it was open right and and

1081
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,530
they were just obviously passing by and

1082
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,109
taking pictures you know how it goes but

1083
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,960
still if you're you know your company do

1084
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:37,058
a Google Streetview of your building you

1085
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,640
know see if there's any badges that are

1086
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:42,820
being displayed any any doors that are

1087
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,080
left open you know any kind of sensitive

1088
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,120
information where you might have to

1089
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,440
contact Devon hey can you guys come take

1090
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,509
a new picture it can give you a new

1091
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,220
picture or don't use this or black it

1092
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:54,520
out or you know whatever the case may be

1093
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:56,620
so leadership leadership CEO CEO CFO

1094
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,170
they don't always sit on the top floor

1095
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:01,600
sometimes it's it's four floors the full

1096
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,980
suite is you know four floors deep and

1097
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,259
you right up to the top and then you

1098
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,790
gotta walk up another floor or you right

1099
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,560
up to the top floor and that gives you

1100
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:10,480
access to another elevator that only

1101
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,940
goes to up to the executive force you

1102
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,830
never know and and then also IT you know

1103
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,320
sometimes ite sits in the middle of the

1104
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:19,920
building typically but I'll tell you

1105
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,090
what's great is you know usually

1106
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,560
everything's nicely decorated so

1107
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:26,740
whenever you pop up on the floor and you

1108
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,779
say hey this has marble floors and all

1109
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,580
the other ones were just tile I think

1110
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,590
I'm on a pretty important floor right I

1111
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,660
want to get off on this floor and check

1112
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:37,360
it out and then and then you might have

1113
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,920
four where hey you hear loud servers

1114
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,360
that's always a nice tell as you know

1115
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,740
you hear loud servers whenever you get

1116
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,330
on a floor and you're like okay this is

1117
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,100
where I want to be as well and then when

1118
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:47,020
in doubt there's usually a building

1119
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,150
directory somewhere laying around I

1120
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,320
snatch those things up and I just start

1121
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,450
reading it like a book come on all right

1122
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,660
yeah we're gonna go to 13 now and we're

1123
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:57,640
gonna go oh it's it's great oh and I

1124
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,830
guess floor 13 doesn't really exist

1125
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,100
sometimes sometimes it's for teens just

1126
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:05,350
be aware that they're doing these I know

1127
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,390
I was talking about remediation testing

1128
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:10,089
and several of our clients have done

1129
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,770
remediation testing where I got in the

1130
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:14,200
first time and they say okay Bryce hey

1131
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,450
okay cool you were lucky like you did it

1132
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,100
but you're not gonna do it again we're

1133
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,419
gonna do it this year again and we're

1134
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,819
gonna fix some things we you know you

1135
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,740
you were able to lockpick your way up

1136
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,210
through these floors you know you you

1137
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,149
bypassed security because you showed

1138
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,470
them a fake badge real cool but you're

1139
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,720
not gonna be able to get in here at this

1140
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:33,819
time well that's all great but whenever

1141
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,890
I came back the second year I actually

1142
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,050
hit um worse right I convinced the the

1143
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,279
person that the front desk person to to

1144
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,880
give me a badge right using the

1145
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,550
contractor the contractor cover so hey

1146
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,620
that was great and and you know multiple

1147
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,150
clients like that I'm still batting a

1148
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,920
thousand right I'm batting a thousand

1149
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,150
and as far as I've never came across a

1150
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,950
building I haven't been able to get in

1151
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:57,200
and then I'm batting a thousand all my

1152
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:59,029
radiation testing right now where I give

1153
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,890
clients the tools they need and and

1154
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,869
they've they've implemented some of them

1155
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,828
but here's the thing I find another way

1156
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:05,750
to get in right

1157
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:07,820
I find another vulnerability and I'm

1158
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,369
gonna use that as well so always

1159
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,990
constantly improving but sometimes I hit

1160
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:14,329
a rule that worse and they're not too

1161
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,640
pleased with that and then so my

1162
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:19,099
foolproof way I call my foolproof way is

1163
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,990
is that contractor adds you know and

1164
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,760
pretending on Who I am you know I

1165
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,618
obviously get in a couple different ways

1166
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,849
but that's always a great one especially

1167
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:28,099
when these buildings are set up the same

1168
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:29,930
but when in doubt hey just tailgate done

1169
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:32,000
right do it the old-fashioned way just

1170
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,700
tailgate in I'd love to cause the scene

1171
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,170
you know maybe yell or scream or trip or

1172
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,578
something and everyone looks at you

1173
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,070
right even on the cameras they all look

1174
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:42,200
at you and then your buddy goes goes and

1175
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,270
follow someone in or jumps over the gate

1176
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,759
or something like that so when in doubt

1177
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:47,210
just tailgate in and hey your glass

1178
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,190
doors

1179
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,240
you know they look pretty I know I know

1180
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,310
a lot of buildings I've been in they

1181
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,290
have these glass doors and they look so

1182
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,119
good but but that does nothing for your

1183
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,740
security right especially if I can get

1184
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,740
to that floor I can peek in there I can

1185
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,529
see that it's a wreck sensor or magnet

1186
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,328
magma core or any of the following right

1187
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,060
or I can come up under the door and use

1188
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:10,700
it I mean come on they're nice but they

1189
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,089
they're just for security they're just

1190
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,589
silly

1191
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:15,770
like I said still batting a thousand so

1192
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:18,799
come at me if you want so how to stop me

1193
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:20,930
how to stop me so so these these

1194
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,760
training policies build them out make

1195
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,740
sure they're there you know take this

1196
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,480
scenario okay I have a building I don't

1197
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,209
think I don't want Bryce getting in here

1198
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,119
you know how do we process visitors who

1199
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:34,000
do we call how do we do it you know did

1200
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,740
we send them an email all that stuff and

1201
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,990
test those right but check the policies

1202
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,910
it's it's not the individuals fault

1203
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,979
right I've had clients where they say

1204
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,299
okay who was it that lets you in right

1205
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,650
who was this person that lets you in

1206
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,359
this front desk security person who was

1207
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,700
working that night right and I say hey

1208
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,078
listen it doesn't matter who it was it

1209
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,000
could have been you were working and

1210
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:55,099
sitting at that desk but my method is

1211
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,839
the same it's never gonna change and the

1212
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:58,099
way I go about it it could have been you

1213
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:59,420
see at the desk and you still wouldn't

1214
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,099
let me in because there's not a process

1215
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,810
for it you don't have anything in place

1216
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:04,210
and there's no training there's no

1217
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,349
training for this so have that in place

1218
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,839
make sure there's no vulnerability there

1219
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:10,760
so prevent tailgating seriously I don't

1220
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:12,470
care if you've been working with Joe

1221
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,860
20 years and you've been sitting next to

1222
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:18,230
him every single day from now on you

1223
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,360
slam the door in Joe's face you do not

1224
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,640
open the door for Joe I don't got okay

1225
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,080
right because here's the thing Joe could

1226
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,480
have gotten fired last night without you

1227
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,130
knowing right and then now he's showing

1228
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,110
up maybe they forgot to revoke his

1229
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,240
access to his badge or they did and

1230
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:34,940
you're letting him in right you're

1231
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,029
letting him and go behind you to do who

1232
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,890
knows what right a disgruntled employee

1233
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:41,780
not always an adversary or you know your

1234
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,879
third-party adversary if you will and

1235
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,440
this employee wants to do harm to the

1236
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,000
organization that just you know fired

1237
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,190
him or laid them off right and you were

1238
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,780
responsible for that so you don't want

1239
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,360
to be responsible because hey you might

1240
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,090
lose your job now or it might cause

1241
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,430
havoc and and and shut the company down

1242
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,360
right you never know

1243
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:01,580
shut that door in that person's face

1244
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,100
hide your badges so many times I have

1245
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,140
I've just wondered around whether it's

1246
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,339
their campus or downtown or something

1247
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,839
and specially during the summertime

1248
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,220
wintertime it's a little bit harder

1249
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,230
because I want hazard jackets on but

1250
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,850
they just have their badges out right

1251
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,130
they just have their badges out and I

1252
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,810
can and - - enough where I can just say

1253
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,030
hey excuse me sir ma'am I need

1254
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,970
directions to whatever I'm not from here

1255
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,410
and I again being the dumbest person you

1256
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,700
said three left's and a right and they

1257
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,830
sit there for ten minutes trying to

1258
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,240
explain something simple to me so I can

1259
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:31,490
just get a good look at their badge

1260
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,439
right and I go make a fake one and get

1261
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,020
in that way validate all visitors with

1262
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,760
employees right so if I'm saying oh hey

1263
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,730
I'm here to see John strand in this

1264
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,110
building I would expect the D front desk

1265
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,760
people to say okay well we're gonna have

1266
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,860
to have John Schrank come down and

1267
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,430
verify you are who you say you are and

1268
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:51,650
basically escort you around right so

1269
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,669
that that will cut out a lot of this of

1270
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,620
what I'm talking about

1271
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,540
just make sure an actual employee and

1272
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,400
mind you the employee needs to verify

1273
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,040
who they are right with that like

1274
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,130
contractor kind of memo that I was

1275
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,480
referring to I'm going to put a actual

1276
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,640
employees name on the bottom of that

1277
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,920
that signed this memo and then I'm gonna

1278
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,600
have a name under it or ask excuse me a

1279
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,310
number under it and I'm gonna say hey

1280
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,110
it's gonna say call this cell phone

1281
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,910
number to basically verify with this

1282
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,990
employee that price is supposed to be

1283
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,480
here and guess who that number goes to

1284
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:23,029
it goes to a rendition InfoSec employee

1285
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,470
and then that employee right they pick

1286
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,690
up the phone they go oh yeah

1287
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:28,279
I'm client so-and-so and yep give them

1288
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,560
whatever they need access to whatever

1289
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,640
it's not a problem and they go okay sort

1290
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,650
of no problem I don't want to get in

1291
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,589
trouble so not only do you have to

1292
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:38,599
verify the visitor with an employee but

1293
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,310
verify the employee as well lease each

1294
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:42,080
other definitely police each other like

1295

1302
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,170
provide that information I know I see a

1303
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,880
lot of questions in here I am gonna get

1304
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:00,440
to them so so here's some frequently

1305
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,000
asked questions last two slides here

1306
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,619
what happens when you get caught right

1307
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,390
so you have a get a jail free card

1308
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:07,340
right you get out for a get out of jail

1309
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:10,009
free letter it's basically this piece of

1310
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,540
paper that sign actually signed behind

1311
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,910
the client in it and it basically says

1312
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,920
hey if you see Bryce this is what's

1313
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:18,200
going on he's doing some nefarious stuff

1314
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,970
call this number the actual number and

1315
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,950
then you know we'll verify it

1316
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,660
now that being said you can carry around

1317
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,549
a fake get out of jail card right

1318
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:28,190
basically if I have this fake one and

1319
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:29,630
someone gets challenged to the point now

1320
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,400
before they call the cops but to the

1321
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,690
point where they say who are you oh my

1322

interview you right in the lobby but

1374
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,910
maybe they take you up to the eighth

1375
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:10,190

not supposed to be and then what do you

1379
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,100
do what do you look for when you get in

1380
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,870
I obviously look for sensitive

1381
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,970
information that would be detrimental if

1382
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:22,940
it got out that I want the client to be

1383
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:25,370
aware of you know PII pH I all that fun

1384
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,990
stuff HIPPA HIPPA information accesses

1385
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,390
right can I access the server room can

1386
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:31,640
access the CEOs office can I access all

1387
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:33,710
these different things and then candy so

1388
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,200
if you're gonna be one of my clients and

1389
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:38,090
you want this done leave some some some

1390
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,649
Reese's peanut butter cups those are my

1391
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:42,230
favorite and I'll leave those off I'll

1392
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:44,450
do those off your desk so I guess it's

1393
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,830
like Santa Claus except I steal that

1394
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:49,370
rather than giving you gift sometimes

1395
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:51,549
silly candy questions there's a couple

1396
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:53,450
good ones I know sigh I know up up here

1397
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:57,140
ever go on site at new construction

1398
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:58,520
buildings I've gone on site to yeah I

1399
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,560
mean where they're doing construction of

1400
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,940
a building it is it is easy right

1401
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,250
because they're just gonna have plywood

1402
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,990
doors no locks or anything like that but

1403
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,940
also remind you they might be doing

1404
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:08,810
construction in the building and you

1405
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,280
didn't know about it

1406
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:12,590
so you might be like hey I need to go to

1407
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,390
for 17 and 18 and ago that's weird like

1408
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,220
that's where construction is going on so

1409
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:18,230
you better have a cover to basically

1410
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,970
basically figure that out and and kind

1411
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:21,700
of you know stray away from there like

1412
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,500
well maybe they met seven and eight

1413
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,779
77019 Jeff admitting that he's pretty

1414
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:31,010
bad at physical pain test that's always

1415
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:33,890
fun I loved you so fun would be done

1416
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,630
let's see what have you done to bypass

1417
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:38,120
reception that requires free scheduled

1418
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:40,700
appointment to lat okay yeah so what

1419
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,200
have you done to to bypass reception or

1420
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,970
front desk security that requires a pre

1421
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,589
scheduled appointment to allow a vendor

1422
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:48,080
or a contractor into the bank hey guess

1423
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:50,600
what it's 1:00 a.m. it's a networking

1424
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,240
issue it's an emergency they just put it

1425
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,069
in or they

1426
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,189
have time to put it in or they didn't

1427
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:58,350
put it in right not my job so sorry

1428
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:00,119
and it's just selling it right and if

1429
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:02,250
they're good they say hey sorry this is

1430
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,070
how it goes but but the thing is is then

1431
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:07,560
it's okay this this security person will

1432
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,970
say well if I don't let them in and they

1433
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,279
said that this needs to be done by the

1434
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:14,730
morning then I might get in trouble

1435
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,290
right so okay hey okay sure you know

1436
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,340
maybe it's just a one-off right and I've

1437
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,259
had that too where they say hey we don't

1438
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,180
typically do this but I'm gonna call

1439
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,100
your your contact to make sure it's good

1440
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,779
and then sure enough we have that

1441
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,299
whenever we'd actually did get denied we

1442
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,800
as in and then we you know got in

1443
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,780
another way we did have it where they

1444
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,880
actually called and they said you know

1445
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,580
hey this is just not how it works

1446
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,070
and we got turned away so so yeah stick

1447
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,360
to your policies all right yeah hand

1448
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,770
deliver flowers to your friends when

1449
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,540
you're on testing and get past nerves

1450
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:44,340
awkwardness absolutely yeah hey do some

1451
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,619
practice right I just feel bad for the

1452
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,840
for the individuals I like give flowers

1453
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:50,970
to or chocolates to and then you know

1454
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,710
they go oh hey honey like I got flowers

1455
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:54,689
thank you so much for those flowers and

1456
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:57,750
chocolates that you gave me today and

1457
00:49:54,690 --> 00:50:00,510
they'd be like yeah man yeah I did that

1458
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:02,520
go problem right or it's just that

1459
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:04,680
awkward conversation and hopefully I

1460
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,440
didn't ruin any relationships there but

1461
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:10,319
I love one and RFID badges help with

1462
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,720
that type of approach stick so yeah I I

1463
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,670
love social engineering because I just

1464
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,470
love talking to people and and the thing

1465
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:18,930
is is that's why I love physical

1466
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:21,480
pentesting is because you know computers

1467
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:24,359
it's one it's one or zero it's either on

1468
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,980
or off if you're testing if RDP is dogs

1469
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:28,920
you're going crazier if you're testing

1470
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,420
for RDP you know is it open or is it

1471
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,119
closed that's that's the only option is

1472
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,760
it up or down with humans it's there's

1473
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,220
that third it's yes no or hey maybe

1474
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,720
maybe maybe I'll let you in and it

1475
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:43,109
depends on the day and depends on the

1476
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:45,118
person have you had any anti anti

1477
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:46,799
rubbering robbery training to avoid

1478
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,109
doing things that raise red flag

1479
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,760
okay yeah so I've had training I've had

1480
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:52,440
training like you can read my little bio

1481
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,780
there but a basically had tactical

1482
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,390
training you know surveillance counter

1483
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,400
surveillance you know cover training all

1484
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:01,589
that fun stuff hitting main offices and

1485
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,970
not retail will hit satellites will it

1486
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:04,710
satellite buildings will hit the main

1487
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:07,169
office like a huge skyscrapers

1488
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:09,089
sometimes like an off-site a dr site

1489
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,859
right a disaster recovery site will hit

1490
00:51:09,089 --> 00:51:12,930
those as well and obviously the approach

1491
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,220
has to be a little bit different so do

1492
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,230
you have a preference for a caller ID

1493
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:18,359
spoofing I don't have a preference

1494
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,839
honestly whatever works so I'll look

1495
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:21,060
into that

1496
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:23,869
I appreciate that it hit me with the

1497
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:26,130
link using really really strong smelly

1498
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:28,339
Chinese food all over reception as a

1499
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,710
distraction I loved it I loved it

1500
00:51:28,339 --> 00:51:34,190
crisp air the best can you fight me

1501
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:36,680
absolutely best candy

1502
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:40,400
so we're now fighting over candy is that

1503
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:42,500
it well it's the it's the candy that I

1504
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,270
want people to leave at their desk when

1505
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,820
I get into the building as a little

1506
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,560
treat for me you know it's a struggle

1507
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,390
it's a struggle working at 2:00 a.m. and

1508
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,630
a building and not having that that pick

1509
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,950
pick me up so it does this it helps help

1510
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,690
some candy makes everything better

1511
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,640
it's like I hacked you but here's some

1512
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:00,380
candy although I did have one customer

1513
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,640
talking about physical pen test so like

1514
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:04,040
we want you to get to the network

1515
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,990
operation center on the third floor and

1516
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,759
I broke in and then I started walking

1517
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,140
around the third floor terrified I'm

1518
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,490
gonna get caught terrified that I'm

1519
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,129
gonna get caught walking around walking

1520
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:15,589

1523
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:22,399

1525
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,630
around walking around and then finally I

1526
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:28,310
