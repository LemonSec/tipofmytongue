ah nope so most of you if you haven't

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,380
heard already I was on a cruise last

24
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:14,149
week in the Caribbean turban ribbon and

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,509
I was on the cruise and while I was on

26
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:21,530
the cruise John did a unscheduled

27
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:23,630
webcast so we hadn't prepped for it who

28
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,670
works with me had the to put all that

29
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,949
together they did the webcast on

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,840
Thursday so I I was able to get some

31
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,460
in-room internet and I sent her a note

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,450
afterwards and I was like Deb how was

33
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:38,270
the webcast and she said it was great

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,039
it went really well John just told us to

35
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,439
that Baba's had confessed is going

36
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,270
virtual at that point I realized that my

37
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,298
vacation was kind of over and even

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,399
though I was in the one a cruise ship

39
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:51,429
also on that cruise ship anytime anyone

40
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,520
coughed on the cruise ship or like

41
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:57,319
allergies allergies but I'm not so sure

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,130
anymore because it's been five days and

43
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:02,719
it's exactly so well we'll see how that

44
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,670
goes so for those are you getting here

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,729
thanks so much for coming to my workshop

46
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,259
it has been quite a week we were able to

47
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,299
put this virtual conference together in

48
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,738
just a few days for the most part a lot

49
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,840
of this was put together of the weekend

50
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,610
where we start putting like actual

51
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,069
structural things in place with Derrick

52
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,510
and some of the other team the first

53
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,310
thing I asked Deb to do was make sure

54
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,920
that everyone that was going to present

55
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,920
this week trainers and speakers had good

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,839
microphones and cameras and so she went

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,268
through and did tests with every speaker

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,489
every person here because you all will

59
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:37,819
be forgiving to slides you will be

60
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:41,389
forgiving forgiving to cameras you will

61
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:43,010
not be forgiving to bad audio and so the

62
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:44,930
most important thing for us was to make

63
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,480
sure that we had good microphones and

64
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,370
good audio and and so we checked all

65
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,920
that anyone that didn't have good audio

66
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,380
we airdrop them essentially from Amazon

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,200
microphones so that way they can present

68
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,970
today and not sound bad anyone that you

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,619
did hear that you're like huh audio is

70
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,310
kind of bad I don't think they showed up

71
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,680
for the test

72
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,930
so you're here I'm here and we're going

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
to talk about how to create help twos

74
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,650
essentially this is just how to get the

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,209
knowledge that's in your brain outs of

76
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,639
people so that they can learn from you

77
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,829
because I have learned so much from

78
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,329
others I believe you've learned a lot

79
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,519
from others I was a teacher for nine

80
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:21,319
years I got a chance to stand up in

81
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,329
front of classrooms and teach all the

82
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,369
things I had learned to others and I was

83
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,380
able to watch them take that information

84
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,940
and start doing something with it and

85
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,799
then they started teaching other people

86
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,470
as they graduated got out into the

87
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,069
industry I taught filmmaking at Full

88
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,599
Sail University from 2003 to 2012 so

89
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,089
about nine years I taught content

90
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,160
creation so producing at the time we

91
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,260
called it low-budget producing because

92
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,790
it wasn't millions of dollars it wasn't

93
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,190
hundreds of thousands of dollars it was

94
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,959
what could you produce for ten bucks

95
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,760
four hundred dollars or a couple grand

96
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,320
and so at the time we called it

97
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,299
independent producer Hilo bunch of

98
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,519
producing looking back on an Al's off

99
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,100
all we were doing is creating what

100
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,990
people are now making content wise and

101
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,180
YouTube wise and everything like that I

102
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,800
will check the questions window but for

103
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,750
the most parts if you have a question

104
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,970
asked in the questions window which is

105
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,370
in the control panel and I will check

106
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,710
that from time to time I don't have any

107
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,989
helpers here today it's just me that's

108
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,829
okay I'd like to thank the 48 of you

109
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,018
that showed up here

110
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,609
it's a open workshop and I really hope

111
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,770
you get something out of it in the next

112
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,410
two hours so with all that preamble and

113
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,510
let's get started so this is the how to

114
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,340
create how to sharing your knowledge who

115
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,469
am i I am Jason Blanchard I work for

116
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,320
Black Hills InfoSec you can follow me on

117
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,510
twitter at badger crash-land I am Jason

118
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,409
at Black Hills InfoSec comm she needs

119
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:44,120
some me an email and I used to if anyone

120
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,850
ever met me when I worked at my previous

121
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,400
employer which is the SANS Institute if

122
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,350
you ever met me there I generally would

123
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,270
introduce myself to a giant room full of

124
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,530
network players and I would say hi

125
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,700
everyone hi I'm Jason I work in

126
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:02,239
marketing and people be like no we suck

127
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:05,030
right we do for the most part I mean we

128
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,650
don't but I mean every email you get

129
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,960
you're like yeah I really want to get

130
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,270
that email when I came to Black Hills

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,210
I asked Jon I was like can I change my

132
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,219
title from marketing to content

133
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,169
community because that's really what we

134
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,260
do we create content and we help build a

135
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:23,510
community and so yeah that's what we did

136
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,919
we changed my title from marketing

137
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,930
director to content and community

138
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,930
director and the reason why is because

139
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:32,630
marketing feels like I'm trying to get

140
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,630
you just doesn't feel right like I just

141
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,460
don't like marketing I don't I like

142
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,010
creating content that's as useful and

143
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,719
beneficial to you and humanity and

144
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,789
things like that and I like creating a

145
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,380
community and if those people choose to

146
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,540
give us money at some point that's

147
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,040
awesome and say don't that's fine but I

148
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,680
believed in community

149
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,540
I owned a comic book store for a bunch

150
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,590
of years and I'm bouncing around here

151
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,060
like you own a comic book store you were

152
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,799
teacher yeah I was doing it all at the

153
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,750
same time it's kind of crazy but I owned

154
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,640
this comic book store and the reason why

155
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,700
our comic store became successful and we

156
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,099
did become very very

157
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,409
successful is because we built a

158
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,260
community and we would throw a party and

159
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,660
like 300 people would show up and for a

160
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,670
comic book store I delaford crazy we

161
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,140
would invite nerdcore rappers to come

162
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,730
and perform in a parking lot like

163
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,469
everything we could do to build

164
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,690
community it even led to a point where

165
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,700
we built a bar inside the comic book

166
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,200
store that we called the geeky Z and the

167
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,550
reason why we called it EK z because it

168
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,810
was kind of like a speakeasy that you

169
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,790
would have to go through the comic book

170
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,650
store to find a secret door that led you

171
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,990
to a bar like this awesome

172
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,150
geek bar and it still exists today if

173
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,670
you do a google search for the geeky Z

174
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,039
in Orlando and a comic shop in Orlando

175
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,570
that's still totally exist so that's a

176
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,950
little bit about me why I don't like the

177
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,290
word marketing anymore

178
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,630
I am a storyteller I believe I was born

179
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,960
to tell stories and I believe we were

180
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,000
all told bored to tell stories and so

181
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,979
what I would highly recommend is if you

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,340
go to and this could be the first link

183
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:04,370
that I give you to go to youtube and if

184
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:08,739
you haven't seen this yet go to jason

185
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:11,650
blanchard Derby con

186
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,479
and you will see a talk that I gave a

187
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,469
presentation or presentations because

188
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:20,340
presenting I gave here so what this is

189
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:23,410
and that the commercial but what this

190
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,909
talk is it's a 30-minute talk is

191
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,729
essentially a talk on how to give talks

192
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,169
and it breaks down how human beings like

193
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,270
to hear information because I was a

194
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:33,580
teacher for nine years and the greatest

195
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,969
thing our university ever did was give

196
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,818
every single student a laptop and at the

197
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,500
time you know before the laptops because

198
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,240
I can remember what life of like before

199
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,889
the students have laptops and what life

200
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,990
was like after the students had laptops

201
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,699
before the students have laptops you

202
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,020
would always hear chatter there was

203
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,150
constant chatter going on in the

204
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,948
classroom so your teaching you have 40

205
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,419
50 under students and hear a little bit

206
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,099
of chatter a little bit chatter

207
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,960
everywhere and normally they were

208
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:01,060
talking about like you say something and

209
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,198
it invokes an idea and then I turned to

210
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,630
the person next to him and they start

211
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,759
talking about it just like right now as

212
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,139
I'm talking to you it invokes an idea

213
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,909
you start thinking about college you

214
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,400
start thinking about if you had a laptop

215
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:13,990
in college like as I speak it starts

216
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,530
invoking and triggering ideas in your

217
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,120
own head

218
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:21,200
and so what happened was prior to the

219
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:25,760
laptops there was chatter

220
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,260
after the laptops chatter stopped and it

221
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,270
took a little while for me to understand

222
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,550
that maybe like a week or two into his

223
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,380
laptops I would say something and I

224
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:37,640
would hear a student like a few seconds

225
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:40,250
later go I was like why are you laughing

226
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,530
he's like well what you said was it was

227
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,810
okay but what he said about what you

228
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,490
said was really hilarious nothing what

229
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,319
do you mean what he said what I said

230
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,560
he's like I just chatted with him was

231
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,320
like you guys are all talking about me

232
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,640
but your laptops though that was a like

233
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,100
the thing that caught me off guard so

234
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,439
you're also talking the the greatest

235
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,540
thing about giving a roomful of students

236
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,120
laptops was all of a sudden I had to

237
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,860
become better than the world essentially

238
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,660
like if you had the ability to watch

239
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,370
youtube videos or watch you know

240
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,589
anything that you wanted to instead of

241
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,480
me you're paying to be in a classroom

242
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,430
but you're paying just like all of you

243
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,500
right now at any time you can choose to

244
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,540
click on another tab you can go watch

245
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,670
anything that you want you can tune me

246
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,810
out and so I have to be better more

247
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,069
interesting and all of that and so the

248
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,680
greatest thing about giving all the

249
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,350
students laptops was that I had to

250
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,880
become a better entertainer I had to be

251
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,460
a better speaker and I had to really

252
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,260
dive into why people like to hear

253
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,930
information the way they do and so what

254
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,400
I do is I recommend you go to this talk

255
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,020
that's currently on your screen and I

256
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,180
hope you can see my screen I think you

257
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,130
can at presentation or presentations

258
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,410
because presenting and the reason why

259
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,270
the title is that is for SEO to do a

260
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,469
Google search for derbycon presentations

261
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,319
I'm one the first thing that pops up

262
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,570
because I do like what I do because I

263
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,980
like messing with people all right and

264
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,610
when I say messing with you I like this

265
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,150
I liked

266
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:10,180
hack all right so let's get back to the

267
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,459
presentation so I am a marketer I'm

268
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,380

269
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,930
practice during stand-up comedy

270
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,600

darknet diaries another one

310
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,529
for darknet Diaries I've started

311
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,209
encouraging people who play back doors

312
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,010
and breaches and they don't know how to

313
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,170
come up with a scenario is to go listen

314
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,970
to a bunch of darknet Diaries and that

315
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,329
would give you a good opportunity to

316
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,580
learn about storytelling and

317
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,860
cybersecurity and coming up with the

318
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,020
breeches or the possible scenarios which

319
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,790
is great

320
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:19,920
satisfactory streamed in okay

321
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,860
hardcore history that sounds interesting

322
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,060
Jason Blanchard reminisces nice thank

323
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,950
you baby so thanks for that and the

324
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,310
reason why I ask is because all of us

325
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:34,649
consume this stuff we are consumers of

326
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:38,430
other people's content and so what I

327
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:40,440
want to start shifting is you going from

328
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,630
a consumer to a producer you know

329
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,310
someone that you know you take a look at

330

what darknet Diaries is doing you take a

331
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,790
look at what Adam Savage is doing you

332
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,750

doing that are successful and you say

335
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,120
that's awesome and I like what they're

336
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,219
doing how can I adapt some of what

337
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,019
they're doing into what I want to do or

338
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,019
what I want to do to share my knowledge

339
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:05,370
and so as you keep posting these their

340
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:07,470
comedy youtubers yeah okay try guys is

341
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,370
come to youtubers so the reason I ask

342
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,290
you is just because we all consume we

343
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,320
all do but I want you to start switching

344
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,180
over to the thought process of I'm a

345
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,519
consumer but now I would be a producer

346
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,829
and I used to tell my students this you

347
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,970
know you teach film school and every

348
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:25,829
person that comes to film school

349
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,199
really wants to make the next big TV

350
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:30,209
show the next big movie the next you

351
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,160
know the next thing they want to be the

352
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:36,180
next Steven spielberger to the next up

353
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,740
that guy from clerks Kevin Smith they

354
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,719
that's what they aspire to do and so I

355
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,880
remember how in film students said you

356
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,529
are the people who follow your dreams

357
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,779
you know there's a dream that you have

358
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:50,820
and you're following them and what you

359
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,860
do as filmmakers is you produce content

360
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,450
and this is going to sound far

361
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,760
you produce content for the people who

362
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,260
don't and it's the people who stay at

363
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,370
home they watch TV and I'm not saying

364
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,050
you're not following your dreams tonight

365
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,579
I was saying everyone that's not sitting

366
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,229
at home are following their dreams but

367
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:06,790
really that's what a lot of us do we

368
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,950
produce content for the people who are

369
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,819
afraid to produce content and now I'm

370
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,110
not saying everyone needs to be a

371
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,029
Content producer and all that stuff

372
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,570
police and twist my words but there's a

373
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:19,390
thing that I shifting from a consumer to

374
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,769
a producer is a different mindset and I

375
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,120
want you to be that kind of person that

376
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,459
if you have a dream inside of you right

377
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,260
now to have your voice heard or to

378
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:29,709
create something or to share your

379
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:32,660
knowledge hopefully in this talk in this

380
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,880
workshop I can help you switch that

381
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,649
raise your hand if you're shy and I know

382
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,829
I won't be able to see it but and I know

383
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:41,120
you're gonna feel we're doing it at home

384
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:43,099
but raise your hand if you're shy and

385
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,069
I'm gonna raise my hand too I'm a shy

386
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:49,459
person I know that 10 minutes people did

387
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:51,290
it in the let's go they did it in the

388
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:53,959
GoToWebinar panel

389
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,980
I am shy if you've ever met me you're

390
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,380
like really you're shy I'm like

391
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,810
absolutely I'm shy ten minutes before

392
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,639
this webcast this workshop started a

393
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,779
harvest are in a race and I was like I

394
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,889
don't know if anyone's actually going to

395
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,389
show up and this is going to be

396
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:09,170
interesting are they gonna pay attention

397
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:10,790
all that stuff so I started getting shy

398
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,410
there's a difference between going up on

399
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,779
stage you know if you've already got a

400
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,660
chance to see me up on stage it seems

401
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,730
like I just look confident and I look

402
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,140
like I'm you don't know what I'm doing

403
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,480
and then as soon as I get off stage it's

404
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,000
like he has it gone and it's nice

405
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,519
um there's you know there's a difference

406
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,930
in that because I'm shy so if you are

407
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,810
shy if you're at home if you're thinking

408
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,089
about how shy you are getting over that

409
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,689
shyness is really the first part of

410
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:41,899
creating content it is that first part

411
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,700
of internally you think who is going to

412
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:47,570
care about anything that I have to say

413
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,860
I'm not smart enough or I'm gonna make

414
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,089
something of people are gonna laugh at

415
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,600
it or I'm gonna make something it's not

416
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:55,790
going to be good and and yes that is

417
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,550
true there's gonna be people that don't

418
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,449
like the things that you make but you're

419
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,979
not making it for them the

420
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,929
think I can if I can teach you today

421
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,549
you're not making something for

422
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,499
everybody you're making something for

423
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,689
the people who want the thing that

424
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,819
you're making hopefully that makes sense

425
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:13,379
is that if there's a hundred people in

426
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:15,269
the room and right now there's fifty

427
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,739
eight of you in this room you all showed

428
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:18,809
up here because you wanted to learn this

429
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:20,549
and so that's a different audience I'm

430
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:22,259
hoping that the fifty-eight of you take

431
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:24,059
there's something away today and you

432
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:25,410
learn something from it but if I was

433
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:27,719
doing this workshop right now for the

434
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,059
entire while was hacking fest virtual

435
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,619
there's about 400 or so people you're

436
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:35,040
the only fifty of people that showed up

437
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:37,949
so if I was doing it for all 400 people

438
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,349
I'm only caring about the 58 of you that

439
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:42,630
showed up that cared about what I had to

440
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,980
say and so that's something I want you

441
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,329
to start thinking about is that you're

442
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,529
not making something for everyone you're

443
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:48,420
making something for the people who are

444
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:50,300
gonna care about what you make that

445
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,430
should take some of the shine this stuff

446
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,490
is it's not about another person who

447
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,589
looked I mean whether the worst comedy

448
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,360
shows I ever did was that besides Las

449
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:02,310
Vegas and if you were there last year

450
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,790
you probably saw it and what happened

451
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:08,339
was we did stand-up comedy in the big

452
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,199
room it was in the big room you got like

453
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,760
a thousand people in that room and they

454
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,069
asked us to do stand-up comedy up there

455
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,569
and I got up on stage and I'm doing my

456
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,770
show and I know my show was funny

457
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,500
because I've done it before in other

458
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:22,199
places and I know my show is funny and

459
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:27,089
as I was doing my show it was it was as

460
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:28,380
if no one cared as if no one cared and I

461
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:32,250
was telling a joke and I got to the

462
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,049
punchline and I heard there like a

463
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,580
person in the third row like over

464
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:40,290
another thank you thank you so much

465
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,000
because I realized that there was a few

466
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,290
people in the room that cared and that's

467
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,200
what we're doing there's this whole

468
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:48,570
world out there and most of them do not

469
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,130
care about what you're about to make but

470
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,960
for that one person who loves for that

471
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,490
one person that says thank you for

472
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,410
creating this because I didn't know it

473
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,270
until you made it that's who we're

474
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,780
making this for

475
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:04,290
all right next your own voice seriously

476
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:07,500
the sound of my voice is the worst thing

477
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,629
in the world to me I don't know if any

478
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,480

479

481
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,210

482
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,659
sudden like it's time to hear the

483
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:25,470
recording and you hear it and like is

484
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,840

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,220
when your computer is somewhere and

491
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,930
getting a better mic is gonna help but

492
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,840
it's only gonna help you hear the sound

493
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:49,150
of your voice better like it it just

494
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,620
does like no must one just want the

495
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,360
worst microphone possible so that way

496
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,949
you can blame it on the microphone what

497
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,110
I want you to do is record the sound of

498
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,410
your voice and just hear it over and

499
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:01,840
over and over and over and over and over

500
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,480
again until it becomes less terrible

501
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,889
because that is all of us all

502
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,050
fifty-eight of you that are currently on

503
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,920
this if I was to like hey I want you to

504
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:13,659
hear the sound of your voice

505
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,760
I also learned long time ago being a

506
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,370
photographer is if you ever take a group

507
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,890
photo of anyone and you hand that group

508
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,600
photo but somebody was in the photo they

509
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,780
don't look at anyone else besides

510
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,780
themselves

511
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,590
settle in for a second do you hand a

512
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,480
group photo to somebody and they're in

513
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,939
it they won't look at anyone else but

514
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,250
themselves and they're looking for flaws

515
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,320
and they're looking for things that they

516
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,000
wish they could improve and it's just

517
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,139
something that we do you know my

518
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,360
daughter came home the other day and

519
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,090
she's like I don't like the way I look

520
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,520
Oh sweetheart I don't think you should I

521
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,439
mean I can understand why you say that

522
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,000
but I don't feel like you should judge

523
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,160
the way you look right now while you're

524
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,840
like in puberty because you're not gonna

525
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:01,200
look like this so you know you from now

526
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:03,990
just like whatever no no you're so cute

527
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,670
but when we look and when we hear

528
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,980
ourselves and we watch our videos were

529
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,080
so critical about what we what we do and

530
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,400
so that's one of the things that you

531
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,490
have to get over is that self-critical

532
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,650
miss and it doesn't go away if I go to

533
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,300
hear the recording of this or if I hear

534
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,460
the recording of my own talks from

535
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:25,710
derbycon or anywhere else there's so

536
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:29,100
much like oh I see that oh there's so

537
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,260
much cringy moments but in the flipside

538
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,790
I'll have hundreds of people reach out

539
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,230
and say thank you so much for doing that

540
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,270
thank you so much for saying that sync

541
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,240
thank you so much for teaching me that

542
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,830
you're welcome you just have to accept

543
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,080
that impostor syndrome we've already

544
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,699
talked about that a little bit but the

545
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,908
sound of your own voice just amplifies

546
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,539
the fact that you shouldn't be talking

547
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:53,720
and since flix darn it to the imposter

548
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:56,450
syndrome kicks in am i qualified to tuck

549
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,609
to teach this at Kellan I think you're

550
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,849
here telling you gave your talk

551
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:03,199
yesterday about you know you're new to

552
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:06,619
this but you still have something to

553
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,789
teach you can still mentor somebody when

554
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:09,678
I work with some of the Black Hills

555
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:11,809
testers you know you have some junior

556
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,279
testers and they have the imposter

557
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,720
syndrome - because we're Black Hills

558
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,609
information security we've ranked blogs

559
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,529
we do these webcast and all these people

560
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,210
show up and when I'm like it when I talk

561
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,580
to a junior tester not like what you

562
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,869
like to give a webcast like how many

563
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,590
people are on it so that's like a

564
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:29,749
thousand like well think about oh you're

565
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:33,559
fine like what am I going to teach

566
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:35,210
somebody and as like - you're a webapp

567
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,519
pen tester in like yeah and I was like

568
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,369
so what did you learn about seven months

569
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,690
ago that you now know but you didn't

570
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,009
know seven months ago you know like well

571
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,289
this this and this I was like that would

572
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:47,570
make a great webcast because there is up

573
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:49,309
most likely a ton of people out there

574
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,899
that also don't know those things now

575
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,309
but if you taught it to them right now

576
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:55,099
they would know those things have mantra

577
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:56,359
now so don't just think that because

578
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:57,590
you're at this point your career you

579
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:59,299
have nothing to teach or if you're at

580
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,399
this point in your career like there's

581
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:04,129
so much for you to share with others and

582
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:05,809
this is not just about InfoSec this is

583
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:07,728
about your hobbies this is about the way

584
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:08,899
that you live your life there are so

585
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:10,700
many things that you can share with

586
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:13,248
others I'm thinking about doing a twitch

587
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,649
show right down on adulting because I'm

588
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,479
41 and I have a 14 year old daughter and

589
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:19,399
I've been married for 21 years it's like

590
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:20,809
is there anything there that I can share

591
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:25,580
with other people who are just learning

592
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:29,869
so there is an opportunity for you to

593
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:32,349
teach somebody something and I want to

594
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:34,369
share this with you is that never deny

595
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:37,309
sharing your knowledge for someone else

596
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:38,939
you know there there are so many people

597
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:42,540
out there that

598
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,630
like I just keep saying would benefit

599
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,940
from what is currently in your brain and

600
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:50,460
so if I can encourage you to do anything

601
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,190
today it's to start submitting CFPs to

602
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,080
talks for other conferences it's to

603
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,180
start your own twitch channel where you

604
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,879
go through how to do web at 10:00

605
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,160
testing it is to do your own your own

606
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,440
short how-to videos on how you use a

607
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,990
tool it's to create your own tools it's

608
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,360
do something like that please never

609
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,250
denies someone else learning what's

610
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,040
currently in your brain because there's

611
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,850
so much knowledge you can share but why

612
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,678
why do any of this

613
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,389
well I do any of this why share your

614
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,620
knowledge like create why raise your

615
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:28,158
hand why face the the criticism why

616
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:31,639
overcome your own fears your shyness fly

617
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,880
do any of this and there are three main

618
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:37,758
reasons there's a B and C the first one

619
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,590
is to give back you know if your whole

620
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,889
intention if your whole purpose is to

621
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:45,168
just say look I learned coming up to the

622
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:47,360
point of my career I've learned over the

623
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:49,279
years how to do these things and I just

624
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,139
want to teach the next generation I just

625
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,240
want to teach somebody else I just want

626
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:55,399
to share what I have that other people

627
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,470
shared with me up to others and if that

628
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:59,209
is your main intention it's gonna shine

629
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,350
it's gonna shine them through and all

630
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,580
the things that you create it's going to

631
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,080
shine through in the way that you teach

632
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,428
it's going to shine through it

633
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,649
absolutely is and people are gonna

634
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:09,320
resonate with that because people like

635
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:12,229
generous other like they will follow

636
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,399
generous people it just will

637
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,740
they'll see someone that's giving away

638
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:18,469
knowledge and they're like thank you let

639
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,809
me learn more from you and so by giving

640
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,309
back you're gonna help others but you're

641
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,470
also gonna start creating community

642
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:26,450
around the knowledge that you're shared

643
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,950
and then those people will start sharing

644
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,080
knowledge I get to see it every single

645
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,090
day of Black Hills is that we share our

646
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,399
knowledge with so many people and we

647
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,370
created a discord channel this week for

648
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:40,039
Black Hills and when we did that we

649
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:42,199
invited 50 people from Twitter we

650
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,149
invited another 100 Twitter and we just

651
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,190
said there you go we're just learning

652
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:48,350
how to use this and they started sharing

653
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,940
knowledge with each other it was a

654
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,620
little bit of you know here's what I've

655
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,630
learned from Black Hills hey I have this

656
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,428
question and B started sharing with each

657
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,789
other and that is exactly what we're

658
00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:01,100
looking for is that we we are the focal

659
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,929
points that got the conversation started

660
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,760
but then once the community gets goings

661
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:06,679
in that community it's just out there

662
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,019
and helping others and so that you can

663
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,000
be the beginning of that conversation at

664
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:12,860
the beginning of that community or what

665
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,289
you want to do if your intention is to

666
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,610
make money you will you absolutely can

667
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,899
make money by sharing your knowledge you

668
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,939
can make it through training you can

669
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,678
make it through uh advertising on your

670
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,919
blogs you can make it through sponsors

671
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,720
so I work in marketing I work in

672
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,580
marketing and if I see somebody out

673
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,830
there that has an audience so darknet

674
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,080
Diaries about a year ago I saw darknet

675
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,269
Diaries and that they were growing and

676
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,889
not only were they also you know because

677
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:38,210
darknet Diaries is fantastic if you

678
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:41,240
haven't heard them go check them out

679
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:44,029
jack is an amazing storyteller and has a

680
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,980
way of relating information to others I

681
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:48,409
can also hear my dogs in the background

682
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,750
just barking and somebody let them out

683
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:52,890
and I'm sure that's fine there's whoever

684
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:56,010
let him out it's gonna bring him back in

685
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,929
so actually I really don't know who let

686
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,000
the dogs out so if you want to make

687
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:02,070
money so when I saw darknet Diaries as a

688
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,299
marketer I looked at the fact that he

689
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,100
was building an audience and I reached

690
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:07,740
out to Jack and I said do you take

691
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,299
sponsorship and so he has a person that

692
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,400
reached out to me and said we absolutely

693
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,320
do and we started looking at you know

694
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,020
would Black Hills sponsored Dark Knight

695
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,428
Diaries and so if you have a show if you

696
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,639
build an audience and people are

697
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:22,020
starting to show up people like me will

698
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,600
show up to and say how much money can I

699
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,100
give you and we do this like there's

700
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,990
gonna be some sponsors that are

701
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,340
currently in there to listen to the

702
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,870
workshop right now I know that you're a

703
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,000
sponsor and I know that you're here and

704
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,469
you do this too when you see somebody

705
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,059
out there that's that's building an

706
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,100
audience and sharing their knowledge you

707
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,840
start looking at them going how can I be

708
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,209
a part of what you're doing to get our

709
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,580
message out to your audience and so if

710
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:46,559
you're building an audience people like

711
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,480
me will show up and ask can I give you

712
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,610
money so that is the thing that you can

713
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,679
do build your career this is an

714
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,439
interesting thing by sharing your

715
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,600
knowledge by being a teacher by being a

716
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,880
subject matter expert but not calling

717
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,959
yourself a salt leader just not leader

718
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,970
when whenever so people ask John come

719
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,220
speak at something and so it's me and

720
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,110
John on a call and they will say John

721
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,750
you're such a thought leader like I can

722
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,309
feel both of us just cringing you know

723
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,770
it's just because neither one of us want

724
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:18,240
to call Jonathan either I don't want to

725
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,950
be a thought leader I just want to be

726
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,110
someone that's sharing my knowledge but

727
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,390
as you become what other people perceive

728
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,939
as a thought leader it will help you

729
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,450
build your career think about this let's

730
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,370
say you're doing a blog one Splunk

731
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,960
all the ins and outs this blog and how

732
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,729
the spunk works and how this works and

733
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,070
how all that stuff works and then all of

734
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,320
a sudden you lose your current job but

735
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,149

736
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,580

737

738
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,600

739
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,330
of people who want to see your content

740
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,340
in the future and you somehow lose the

741
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,470
job that you have due to whatever

742
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,360
happened no it's layoffs so the company

743
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,130
folded or they got bought out by someone

744
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,350
else they didn't want you whatever it is

745
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:03,000
that caused you to lose your job and you

746
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:05,370
have this audience this community these

747

people who respect you and look at you

748

to learn from

749
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,059
and all of a sudden you write a tweet

750
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,520
saying hey everyone I'm currently

751
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:14,260

756
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,210
career by giving back by sharing your

757
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,750
knowledge by creating content and by

758
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:33,700
being brave even though you're shy oh I

759
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:36,790
love this quote - bravery oh I wanna see

760
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:40,390
it right saving a baby that fell into a

761
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,290
pool is not really brave it's just the

762
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,840
right thing to do

763
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:46,060
he's you know baby Falls employee jump

764
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,889
in the same

765
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,750
not really breathe

766
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,620
now a baby falling into a pool full of

767
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,420
sharks and then you jump in to save it

768
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,820
that's bravery and so what I mean by

769
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,580
that is if you're afraid if you're

770
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,220
scared if you're shy and you still do it

771
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,899
anyway that's being brave but if you're

772
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,340
like wow this is really I don't know if

773
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,990
that's bravery and if you're sitting

774
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,669
here like

775
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,740
Jason that feels controversial let me

776
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:15,160
talk about in this Court channel because

777
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:18,460
I like to start conversations okay so if

778
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,050
your goal is to give back and that is

779
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,180
where you start from that is your

780
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:24,340
intention and that is when you're

781
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,310
creating anything that is where you're

782
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,649
you're the center of the of your why if

783
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,480
your reason is to make money then that's

784
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,770
the center of your why and so that's

785
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,300
going to change the way that you create

786
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:37,420
your content and how you reach out to

787
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,879
sponsors if your goal is to build a

788
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,170
career and that's the core of why you're

789
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,670
doing it it's going to change the

790
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,880
content is create and why you're keep

791
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:50,020
braiding it but I will tell you this if

792
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,820
your sole intention is to get back you

793
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,120
will make money and you will build your

794
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,700
career

795
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,070
I get just it will happen if you start

796
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,270
from the generosity of giving back those

797
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,010
other two things will happen

798
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,810
it just does

799
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,770
all right so some of the types of things

800
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,540
that we're going to talk about today so

801
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,889

802
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,290
different types of things that you can

803
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,940
create and then I'm gonna get real

804

00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:36,210
so I got done doing this whole talk yeah

815
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,980
for the most part I did this talk at

816
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,620
Derby calm but it's more expanded for

817
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,540
you all I gave this talk at Derby con

818
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,969
and right afterwards a guy came up and

819
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,220
said Jason I loved everything you said

820
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,230
you know it was good I see the the

821
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,270
beneficial giving back I see this I see

822
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,620
all that but I work for an organization

823
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,740
where I can't talk about any of the

824
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:58,260
things that I do yeah that is a thing in

825
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,560
security well I had not thought of that

826
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,240
and so I added this slide for you that

827
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,790
person who's in a position where you

828
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,410
can't give a live presentation you can't

829
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:10,020
do a webcast on the things that you know

830
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:12,540
you can't write a blog because of the

831
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,790
nature of the work that you do and so I

832
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,620
just well as I was talking to her I

833
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,420
realized there's a difference between an

834
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,459
internal audience and a public audience

835
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,830
and so for those of you that are in that

836
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,320
inside that world where you can't share

837
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,060
outside of that world what I'd like for

838
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,970
you to start doing is think about how

839
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:32,399
you can be that internal creator of

840
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,690
content and so what I mean by that is if

841
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,460
you work in an organization where you

842
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,500
can't really share things out outside

843
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,830
what if you created the internal

844
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,710
security blog or your company or in a

845
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:46,350
how-to video inside your company or you

846
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,110
initiated the conversation with the

847
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,790
executives on security and you gave them

848
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,560
a rundown and here's how phishing works

849
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,210
for executives here's how this works for

850
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,340
executives and you started taking the

851
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,890
knowledge that you had and break it down

852
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,899
for people who are not in your section I

853
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,310
remember I talked to Derek Brooke one

854
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,930
time and Derek gave his presentation

855
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:07,560
this morning I don't know if he's here

856
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:10,020
but he did an internal CTF I think was a

857
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:13,620
physical pentesting CTF at his

858
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,870
organization so it was picking the locks

859
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,419
of your internal doors or

860
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:21,229
and I may have this wrong but I think I

861
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:24,720
had it right but it was a internal

862
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:27,720
physical pentesting CTF inside your org

863
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,820
and so what he thought he taught some

864
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,770
lock-picking he's taught this and he's

865
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,149
like you know came up with the CTF

866
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,620
inside his organ and that's awesome

867
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,900
that's like engaging that's getting

868
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,179
people interested but then you become

869
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:43,110
the subject matter expert for security

870
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:44,370
and so think about can I apply any of

871
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,590
the things that I'm about to talk about

872
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,419
to of that internal audience or can I

873
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,129
apply to a public audience now the

874
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,300
public audience if you work in security

875
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,860
and you can't share any of the things

876
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,139
that you have there then the public

877
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,689
audience might be one of your hobbies

878
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,480
there aren't like my core is this hobby

879
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:04,320
this amazing hobby of making knives and

880
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,559
making steel cutting instruments I think

881
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,149
that's a sword I got yeah but he created

882
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,530
an Instagram for that and he started

883
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,780
getting out there and he got invited to

884
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,940
be on this TV show because of the work

885
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:18,450
that he does it's incredible and so

886
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,470
there's a if you have this hobby or if

887
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,080
you have this thing that you'd like to

888
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,670
do maybe that's the public mounting that

889
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,530
you create and then if you take your

890
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,080
security that's the internal work that

891
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:31,139
you do now I have this other note here

892
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,059
laser focused and so when I talked film

893
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,710
school students would come in and they

894
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:36,570
would pitch projects and like I had this

895
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,130
idea for a move you had this idea for TV

896
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,960
show I have this idea for you know web

897
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,270
series and the first question we'd

898
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,970
always ask us who is your audience you

899
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,280
know like what's everyone that is the

900
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,860
worst answer because it is not for

901
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:53,129
everybody and so what we would do is we

902
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:55,260
start diving down who that audience is

903
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:57,780
and what we would normally do is say who

904
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,520
the audience isn't and so you would have

905
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,200
to get into demographics and so

906
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,210
demographics is normally big chunks of

907
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,210
people and I would say are these the

908
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,250
kind of people like their own cruises

909
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,170
and there is a kind of person that goes

910
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,940
on the cruise I became that person last

911
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,139
week there's also the kind of person

912
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,030
that goes on the cruise in the middle of

913
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,250
the corona virus that's a different

914
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:21,000
demographic but you have these people

915
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:23,340
that do they wear Wranglers

916
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,109
in clerks I was like yeah that's a kind

917
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,909
of person I mean there's a there's a

918
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:28,770
demography out there of people who wear

919
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,050
Wranglers and so you start diving

920
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,659
through Timah graphics and as we would

921
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,520
use different types of demographics you

922
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,830
would start narrowing down your audience

923
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,980
and so it'd be like is it the kind of

924
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,270
person that uses Linux like yes Wells

925
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,899
are the kind of person I'd use Windows

926
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:49,080
yeah so as you start thinking about all

927
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:50,879
the people who it is not you would be

928
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,460
left with the person who is that it is

929
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,080
for and the reason why this is important

930
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,699
because it gets back to that there's a

931
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,980
thousand people in the room but only

932
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,299
four people are listening trying to do

933
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,869
comedy in a room full of a thousand

934
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,910
people

935
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:04,260
that wasn't my target audience the

936
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,210
target audience was the four people

937
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,770
imagine if I had taken those four people

938
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,330
into a cyber room and did the show for

939
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,060
them it would've been a completely

940
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:14,460
different experience and so that you

941
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,920
started looking at this laser focused

942
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,240
audience group because you're not making

943
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,420
it for everyone you're making it for the

944
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,890
people who care and so if you do come up

945
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,720
with an idea you do like I'm gonna write

946
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,640
a blog about this I'm gonna do this the

947
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,410
first thing I want you to do is write on

948
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,410
your sheet of paper who is my audience

949
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,869
and start thinking about all the people

950
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:37,299
that it's not and then you'll be left

951
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:39,340
the people who it is and then you can

952
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,460
figure out how to reach those people and

953
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:46,540
we'll talk about that in a little bit

954
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:48,760
content chunking yeah I love this so

955
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,250
much being a person who creates content

956
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,470
is that your goal is to make a big thing

957
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,710
that can be broken into smaller things

958
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:58,240
but it's a big thing I can be broken in

959
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:01,119
smaller things so you're always thinking

960
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,339
what is the big thing I can make that

961
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,710
can be broken into smaller things what I

962
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:09,230
mean by that is can I give an hour-long

963
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,990
webcast that has

964
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:14,060
full breaks in it so every five minutes

965
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,618
I'm talking about this subject and I'm

966
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,970
talking about this subject or this

967
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:20,340
subject but this is up

968
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:23,430
then can I break that webcast down into

969
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,290
five minute section I then make those

970
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,080
five minute sections available on

971
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,369
Twitter or someplace else like how can I

972
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,779
make the big thing that I put on

973
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,869
youtubes and I could break it into

974
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,660
smaller things or how can I make a at

975
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:38,580
sans I made a lot of posters and so if

976
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,930
you have like the blueprint pentesting

977
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,090
poster that was something that I made

978
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,580
with our graphic designer if you have

979
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:46,680
the pivots and payloads you know the

980
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,690
game poster you can download all these

981
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,190
PDFs if you want the first poster that

982
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,710
we started with was the whiteboard

983
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,990
poster and let me go ahead and bring

984
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,960
that up

985
00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:03,200
and she what we did with it so if you go

986
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:06,260
to white board poster sans pen testing

987
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,509
okay also I've been staring at the white

988
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,970
ring around my camera for a while and so

989
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:13,819
then I got this cute

990
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,290
hopefully you can see this what this is

991
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:18,440
it's

992
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:21,650
things that would help you with bash our

993
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:24,680
shell Python some commanded exe these

994
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,880
are all little hints and notes that

995
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,799
would just help you be a better pen

996
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,010
tester and so you can take a look at

997
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:35,030
that and go download it so the idea was

998
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:36,260
you are the kind of person you know when

999
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:38,120
you find something that's good you write

1000
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,070
it down you're like keep it and so what

1001
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,839
if you were in your cubicle or if you

1002
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:45,630
were at your home or somewhere and you

1003
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:47,460
started hosting shows up around you

1004
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,319
and so that was the initial concept it

1005
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,509
was like okay so it's like a whiteboard

1006
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:52,890
you know you got all your notes on

1007
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:54,390
whiteboard well what if we just created

1008
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,799
the whiteboard and then we sent it to

1009
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,629
people and so it's already got all the

1010
00:37:55,799 --> 00:37:59,279
notes on it so that's where we did we

1011
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,170
designed this to look like a whiteboard

1012
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:02,819
and if it's hanging up in an office it

1013
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:05,279
looks like someone's actual whiteboard

1014
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:08,160
if it's actually a big poster and it

1015
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:09,809
looks like you're just really diligent

1016
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,058
about finding things that will help you

1017
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:14,640
do your job and so we created this

1018
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:17,819
poster and then here's the part that I

1019
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,859
really liked is that each one of these I

1020
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:23,038
don't know if you can see my mouse each

1021
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:25,380
one of these became a piece of content

1022
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,349
that wasn't shared on social social

1023
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,329
media and so each one of these cards on

1024
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:32,160
you know so there's five Python cards

1025
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:34,500
there's like six PowerShell cards just

1026
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,509
like nineteen bash cars and there's this

1027
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,450
each one of those wasn't broken down

1028
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:41,640
into its individual piece and then that

1029
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,919
was shared out and what we did is that

1030
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,769
we said if you like this then click this

1031
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,650
link to go get a full poster or to ask

1032
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:51,750
for us to mail it to you and so all this

1033
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,180
was broken down into individual chunks

1034
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:56,320
and so if you look at the giant poster

1035
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,960
PDF here

1036
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,550
this all broke down and it was

1037
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,059
promotional because you can't make

1038
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:06,999
anything without being able to sell it

1039
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:08,979
- do we get this here all broken down

1040
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:12,879
the individual pieces that's what I mean

1041
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:14,259
you create a giant chunk of content how

1042
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,449
can I do it how can I make something

1043
00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:18,609
that's big and then break it down into

1044
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:20,859
its individual pieces if you've ever

1045
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:23,828
played back doors and breaches that is

1046
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:25,479
what this is we said how can we make

1047
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,039
something that's incredibly useful to

1048
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:28,749
people something that's gonna help them

1049
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,809
with doing instant response like the

1050
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:34,598
sole purpose the intent was how do we

1051
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:36,130
get back absolutely the very core of

1052
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,289
this was how do we get back how do we

1053
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,809
create something that benefits people

1054
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:42,789
now it is beneficial to us because each

1055
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:45,219
one of these has like a blog on it that

1056
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:46,809
leads back to us but the sole purpose in

1057
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,999
the very beginning the genesis of this

1058
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:51,369
was how can we create but if you take a

1059
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:54,038
look at the concept of content chunking

1060
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:56,499
this is a deck of cards all of this is

1061
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,059
one big piece of content big it's

1062
00:39:56,499 --> 00:40:00,640
content that teaches people something

1063
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:05,049
and it leads back to learn more but then

1064
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,058
each card is a piece of content so this

1065
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:09,519
is one big piece of content the whole

1066
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:12,309
deck and then each one of these is its

1067
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,078
own piece of content that leads to other

1068
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:15,400
pieces of content because there's links

1069
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,549
on here and there's other things like

1070
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,439
that so if you go to and I wanted to

1071
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,290
post an example today for you if you go

1072
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:25,460
to the

1073
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,460
be Black Hills

1074
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:32,080
I did this today as an example so this

1075
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,520
is one card of 52 and here's the two

1076
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,520
blogs that lead back to it and if you

1077
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,160
take a look at some of the stats 12

1078
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,250
click throughs or link click throughs

1079
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,129
lead back to the website and so people

1080
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,900
learned more about fishing today because

1081
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,450
of that link

1082
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,829
so content chucking the concept again

1083
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,680
just to run through it as you great

1084
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:55,480
you're like how can I make something big

1085
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,200
and then break it into smaller

1086
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,200
individual pieces

1087
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:05,079
evergreens

1088
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,190
so whatever green means is that you make

1089
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,560
something that lasts

1090
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,480
or forever essentially you write a blog

1091
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,060
that can be useful to anyone for the

1092
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,770
next 5-10 years you do a webcast that's

1093
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,990
gonna be useful for the next five to ten

1094
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:19,339
years you create a tool that's gonna be

1095
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,290
useful for the next five to ten years

1096
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:22,819
you're always thinking about is this

1097
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,800
something that's gonna be evergreen and

1098
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:27,470
not everything that you make will be

1099
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,800
evergreen I remember we put out a blog

1100
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,720
last year and Kari wrote it to is a it

1101
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,890
was a how to bypass Windows Defender or

1102
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,649
something like that it was something

1103
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:39,348
that was like no this is this is really

1104
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:43,069
good useful great put out to an audience

1105
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:46,280
and was in a day that blog was dead -

1106
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:48,440
someone at Microsoft was like oh no and

1107
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,420
they fix it they fix the bug like almost

1108
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,490
instantly and so that blog was pretty

1109
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,650
much dead within a week and so we're

1110
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,450
like no that's that sucks but the

1111
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,339
techniques that were used in it we're so

1112
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,618
useful and so in a little bit you'll get

1113
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:01,640
a chance to see our content library and

1114
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:04,579
when I go through the content library

1115
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,250
you're gonna see tons of blogs that are

1116
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:09,859
just read out what that means is that

1117
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,230
they're no longer useful because the

1118
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:15,190
techniques or the the tool that was used

1119
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:16,750
no longer useful and

1120
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,670
and pentesting our offensive security

1121
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,079
but you're gonna see a ton of them that

1122
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,810
are still useful so a blog written in

1123
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,880
2017 and still be useful to somebody in

1124
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,529
2020 because the techniques use the

1125
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,720
tools use are so useful and that's what

1126
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,270
I mean by evergreen is that you've wrote

1127
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,520
it in 2017 but you can still keep using

1128
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,930
it all the way up until today and so

1129
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,280
when you're looking at creating your own

1130
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,660
content you know that's something to

1131
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,369
keep in mind is this something that's

1132
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,170
going to be evergreen every single piece

1133
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:43,200
of content needs to be evergreen but

1134
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:45,030
just really good if it is

1135
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,640
content library make it once use it over

1136
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:50,520
and over and over over and over and over

1137
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:53,230
again so content library I'm gonna show

1138
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,600
you what ours looks like

1139
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,130
so every time you create a piece of

1140
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,640
content

1141
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:02,470
well that's the name of it this is when

1142
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,359
it was published we give all of our

1143
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:06,490
contents an ID and that's Mick Douglas

1144
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,340
and he wrote this and we can take a look

1145
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,600
at come how many people clicked on it we

1146
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:14,530
could take a look at where the link is

1147
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,839
you know I stuff and then we also have a

1148
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:21,220
content library that goes along with it

1149
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,930
so this is the same title same ID yeah

1150
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,730
Mick Douglas and then we have a

1151
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:27,339
pre-written tweet and a pre-written

1152
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:29,530
LinkedIn post are you ready to go and

1153
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,210
this was built so that way we could hire

1154
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:33,610
interns to be able to do our social

1155
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,440
media scheduling for us and so we can

1156
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:38,710
schedule out and say on this date that

1157
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,780
this time post Z reserves of one if you

1158
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:46,030
never noticed this before on all of our

1159
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:47,260
graphics on our post on these see do you

1160
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,330
look it up in that top corner you got

1161
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:52,480
zero zero four three six that is the

1162
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:54,430
graphic that goes with that post and so

1163
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,290
we created this so that way if an intern

1164
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,089
and I'm not saying interns aren't smart

1165
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,620
I'm just saying interns you need to get

1166
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:01,180
the speed quickly and you need to turn

1167
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:03,279
them over and if you're managing them

1168
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:07,230
all the time then why even have an

1169
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,820
intern so we created this uh you know

1170
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:13,660
content library so that way if you

1171
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:16,450
create something back in 2015 and it's

1172
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:19,660
still useful well then you can still

1173
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:22,000
post it now I know it's made 2015 but

1174
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,410
like I said if it's still useful and so

1175
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,360
as you go through here and as you can

1176
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,980
see all the red those are no longer we

1177
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,900
asked all the pen testers and all the

1178
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,540
blogger authors to go through and say is

1179
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,540
this blog so relevant is this blog so

1180
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:36,700
good art is and every ones that are read

1181
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,440
it was no

1182
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:42,040
but you see all the ones that are still

1183
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,410
not read and we can post those

1184
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,180
and why are we posting them because

1185
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,370
they're helpful because we're giving

1186
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,690
back to the community it does lead

1187
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,430
people back to our website and if they

1188
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,200
want to hire us they can but the sole

1189
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,149
purpose of it is that this is useful

1190
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,129
information we're getting out to an

1191
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:59,020
audience and those people have been

1192
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:03,400
sharing with others and learning from it

1193
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:05,830
and the blog written in 2017 you may

1194
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,300
think like I already know that you may

1195
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,680
think you already know that like it was

1196
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,650
written in 2017 I've been in industry

1197
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,569
for five or six years I know that why

1198
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,670
are you still posting it and it's really

1199
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,140
because of that new student who just got

1200
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,270
into college who's starting to learn

1201
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:22,089
cybersecurity that decided to follow our

1202
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:24,880
Twitter feed and now they're like oh

1203
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:26,770
what is that and now they're learning

1204
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,010
something so it's once again it's not

1205
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:31,900
just about you it's about the whole

1206
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:34,660
community and so the thing that you

1207
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,220
create that you created a few years ago

1208
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:39,680
could still be useful to that person

1209
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:41,959
who's just getting started

1210
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,149
all right so this is what a content

1211
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,390
library looks like and this is how you

1212
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:49,580
manage it super simple how do you create

1213
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,170
graphics you can do it on Fiverr you can

1214
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:58,480
find someone on Fiverr so if you get a

1215
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:58,480
fiber fi berr yes

1216
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:02,680
a great place to find graphic artists is

1217
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:05,770
to go to Fiverr and you can hire them

1218
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,060
and once you create the template once

1219
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:09,220
you creates a template then it's just a

1220
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,319
matter of sending here's a new title

1221
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,240
here's this here's the number please add

1222
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:16,089
it and change it so we have a graphic

1223
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,890
designer that works with us and her job

1224
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:19,810
is to make these she makes a lot of

1225
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:23,970
other things but one of her jobs is to

1226
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,970
create these for us to share

1227
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,290
there's

1228
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:40,940
all right and then one last like tip

1229
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:45,210
before we start diving into some of the

1230
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:48,810
more how to's is interviews

1231
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:51,510
so let's say you are a you want to start

1232
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:54,090
a podcast that talks about Hollywood

1233
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:55,530
Stuntz and I'm just starting it was like

1234
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,310
a brain of thing that seriously just

1235
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,500
popped into my head

1236
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:01,328
and you want to do a podcast on

1237
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,859
Hollywood stunt people

1238
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:05,349
because you want to be a Hollywood stunt

1239
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:06,759
person or you just loves Hollywood

1240
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:09,970
stunts

1241
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:12,210
what you can do is reach out to

1242
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:14,098
Hollywood stunt people

1243
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:19,010
and one of the ways to do that is to go

1244
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:22,800
to IMDB if you didn't know I am DD

1245
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:24,900
Breaux I don't have a pro account so I

1246
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,300
can't show you right now but if you go

1247
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,700
to IMDB Pro back when I worked in the

1248
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:33,059
film industry all the time IMDB Pro is

1249
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:35,220
my best friend but with IMDB Pro you can

1250
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,599
essentially find any agent or contact

1251
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,328
information for anyone in the film

1252
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,700
industry so two years ago I ran

1253
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:43,349
something called free comic book day so

1254
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,140
if you've ever been to a comic book

1255
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:47,609
store for a few years I was the person

1256
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,190
who brand free comic book day for the

1257
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:51,509
creek for a comic industry and one of

1258
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:54,390
the things I would do for a free combat

1259
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:56,430
days I would reach out to celebrities

1260
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,930
I'd reach out to people in the industry

1261
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:00,118
and I would ask them if they would make

1262
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:03,299
videos or something to help promote free

1263
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:07,650
callable day and I am going to show you

1264
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:10,880
my favorite person that I ever got to do

1265
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,880
a free comic book day

1266
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:20,990
this it's levar burton it was like the

1267
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:23,509
best day of you adult Jason's life when

1268
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:25,459
I got a chance to reach out to levar

1269
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:28,460
burton through his agent through IMDB

1270
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,990
Pro and so I got into contact and I said

1271
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,370
this is who we are that we're free comic

1272
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,410
today we're all about you know comic

1273
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:35,960
books and we were looking to see if

1274
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:39,080
lebar levar would do this and they said

1275
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:41,030
sure and so I got a chance to call and

1276
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,380
talk to levar burton walk him through

1277
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,510
what we're looking for

1278
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,370
he asked me you know like why are we

1279
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:48,260
doing this and you know not why we're

1280
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:50,089
doing this but like try to get the wise

1281
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:52,850
that way he could say what he wanted to

1282
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:54,880
say properly and he did it and so the

1283
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:59,060
reason why I bring this up is because I

1284
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,950
have very limited Osen skills super

1285
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:03,980

1286
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:05,149

1287
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,700

1289
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,480
track down anybody anywhere and so I

1290
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:14,480
want you to start thinking about that

1291
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,339
that with IMDB Pro or your other

1292
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,099
websites that you know that you can

1293
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:21,740
track people down I mean back in like

1294
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:24,079
2004 or five when Facebook was starts

1295
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,000
just starting you could message anybody

1296
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,280
I was before they set you to the other

1297
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,710
category you can message anybody and

1298
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,020
back then I would reach out to Hollywood

1299
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:34,490
producers and directors and writers and

1300
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,710
I would just send them messages like hey

1301
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:38,000
I'm Jason um this and they would get

1302
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,560
back home with me not all of them

1303
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,200
because not everyone always gets back

1304
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,630

1305
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:48,890

1315
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,950

Jason there is anyway it was fun but

1323
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,819
this guy went on to become like an

1324
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:34,369
amazing superstar in the comic book

1325
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:37,869
industry so he writes tons of other

1326
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:40,490
great books and it really started with a

1327
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:42,170
myspace message where we got to meet him

1328
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:47,569
got to know him and we've been friends

1329
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:49,220
since like 2006 and I'm I'm not a my

1330
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:50,990
name dropping I hope I'm not name

1331
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,540
dropping what I'm hope I'm doing is

1332
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,950
showing you how you can use your Osen

1333
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,319
skills to get in touch with people

1334
00:50:54,950 --> 00:51:00,589
because here's here's the step I want

1335
00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:03,410
you to take next if you have a show or a

1336
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:05,859
webcast or a blog or this and you want

1337
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:09,019
to interview somebody that's

1338
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:11,000
don't go a list famous because you don't

1339
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:12,709
have an a-list audience to get a list

1340
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,960
famous people yet I mean if you want to

1341
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:17,089
feel free to go and try that but if

1342
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,369
you're looking at the B level or sea

1343
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:21,529
level or D level or the crew level you

1344
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:22,849

1345
00:51:21,529 --> 00:51:24,140
industry over here a part of this

1346
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:25,730
industry are part of that industry

1347
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,390

1348
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,549
like that

1349
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:30,589

you come on and allow me to interview

1356
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:43,700
you now as a part of my job one of the

1357
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,480
things I do is I go out and I look for

1358
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:49,640
podcasts I look or shows and I say we

1359
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,680
have these testers would you like them

1360
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,569
to be a part of your show and a lot of

1361
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,190
these your podcasts and like your

1362
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:57,619
podcast you're gonna you're gonna need

1363
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,450
someone to interview and so marketers

1364
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:00,710
like me are always reaching out and it's

1365
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,269
not going to be a sales pitch it's no

1366
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,740
vendor pitch and now you highly

1367
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:05,089
recommend that you don't do vendor

1368
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,640
pitches and sales pitches because that

1369
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:09,859
just turns off your audience is that you

1370
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,839
reach out to the person you want to

1371
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:12,710
interview and say I have this show would

1372
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,950
you like to be on it

1373
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:18,980
now if they say yes and you're doing the

1374
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:21,029
show together what are you doing while

1375
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,640
you're interviewing person

1376
00:52:21,029 --> 00:52:25,469
you're starting a relationship you're

1377
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,058
creating a relationship this person that

1378
00:52:25,469 --> 00:52:28,589
you're interviewing and that

1379
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:30,179
relationship may turn into a business

1380
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:31,769
relationship may turn into a personal

1381
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:34,589
relationship may never go anywhere else

1382
00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:37,769
but that interview interview is your

1383
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:40,199
first step to building a new contact a

1384
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:41,519
new connection and your networking it's

1385
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,979
an opportunity for you to make friends

1386
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,008
and I call it the Trojan horse because

1387
00:52:43,979 --> 00:52:48,390
there are some people who if your sole

1388
00:52:47,009 --> 00:52:51,329
purpose is to make money or build your

1389
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:53,699
career with your content you're creating

1390
00:52:51,329 --> 00:52:55,349
they do this on purpose what they'll do

1391
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:57,689
is they'll take a look at their top 50

1392
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:59,309
prospects or the top 50 leads or the top

1393
00:52:57,689 --> 00:53:01,379
50 companies that they want to work for

1394
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:03,179
and they will reach out to those top 50

1395
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:06,239
companies and say would you like to be

1396
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:08,689
on my show that is their first step in

1397
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:11,400
the door now working with that company

1398
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:14,879
this is something people really do and

1399
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,679
so if that is a goal or the intent of

1400
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,599
yours if you're a business that does

1401
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:20,339
pentesting and you want to do it for

1402
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:21,689
these companies you can reach out to

1403
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:23,339
these companies you can say hey we'd

1404
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:25,739
like to bring you on the show and we

1405
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:27,299
want to talk about security and so maybe

1406
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:29,039
you're talking to the sister or talking

1407
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:30,569
to this person I'm talking to them about

1408
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,699
things that they can talk about because

1409
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:34,680
once again the work that we do would be

1410
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:37,860
pretty

1411
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,750
Begg when we do discuss it and so as

1412
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,580
you're talking with these people you're

1413
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,470
also building an injury relationship

1414
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,730
with them now if your sole purpose is to

1415
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,410
make money or build your career then

1416
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:48,620
what you do is about three or four days

1417
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:51,000
later you send them the link or the

1418
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:52,290
podcast or the show or the Twitter or

1419
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,610
whatever it is that you're creating you

1420
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,200

1423
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:02,640
again and talk to you in the future if

1424
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:04,830
they respond back then it's like a what

1425
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:08,129
we eat and marketing call a drip

1426
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:10,170
campaign is that you start with this hey

1427
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:11,880
let me introduce you and then over time

1428
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,160
let's build this relationship and then

1429
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,170
over time I would like to tell you about

1430
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,509
a product that I have or a service that

1431
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,790
I offer so this is something that you

1432
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:22,740
can do and it this turns you off if if

1433

you're like oh big cool good and you're

1435
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:31,050
gonna start with that the sole purpose

1436
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,910
for doing this is to get back ok what

1437
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:35,250
I'm saying is that whatever your intent

1438
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:37,109
is there's an opportunity here so if

1439
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,370
your intent is to get back and maybe

1440
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,680
it's just building relationships with

1441
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:42,450
people who taught you something and you

1442
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,370
want to bring them on because that

1443
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,629
person taught you something and you want

1444
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,770
to give them an opportunity to share

1445
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,570
with the audience that you've been

1446
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,950
creating

1447
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:52,650
interviews our Trojan horse and you have

1448
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:54,960
amazing Osen skills there is nobody

1449
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:56,520
that's outside your grasp of reaching

1450
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,790
out to and asking if they can be a part

1451
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,790
of your show

1452
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:07,140
I'm going to

1453
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:10,520

[Music]

1479
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:29,090
I get the Ryan Reynolds thing often

1480
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:32,359
I I feel like I'm the more the better

1481
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:33,500
looking version of Ryan Reynolds you're

1482
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:35,090
watching something else other than

1483
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,240
discord during your talk that explains

1484
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:37,240
it

1485
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:44,540
so we're going to start up again at 105

1486
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:47,650
for content in the meantime take a break

1487
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,650
and I will answer question

1488
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:56,569
is giving back to the industry

1489
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,569
the best sort of guidance

1490
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:03,280
know that that's not my guidance my

1491
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:06,160
guidance is know why you're doing it

1492
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,920
so it's it really does boil down to

1493
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,069
those three things is it to make money

1494
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:14,140
build your career or give back and so

1495
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:16,630
you just need to know why you're doing

1496
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:20,560
it because if your goal is to make money

1497
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:22,590
then that a year later is your key

1498
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:26,529
performance indicator like you've made

1499
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:28,090
$10,000 like okay so that is your key

1500
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:30,040
performance indicator if it is to build

1501
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:32,380
your career than a year later do you

1502
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,970
have a different do you have the job

1503
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:38,020
that you want that you didn't currently

1504
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:40,359
have if you're if the reason why is to

1505
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:42,160
get back and maybe it's the community

1506
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,510
that's being built and the amount of

1507
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,609
people that are showing up to your

1508
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:48,520
webcast and it's it's about the numbers

1509
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:50,320
of humans and it's not necessarily the

1510
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,590
number with the connections that are

1511
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:56,650
being made a lot of times we have over a

1512
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:58,000
thousand people in our webcast and you

1513
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:00,070
see the same faces over and over and

1514
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,850
over again those people are becoming

1515
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:06,370
like family and so what's cool is that

1516
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:09,100
you see the same people coming back and

1517
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:11,740
it's not just becoming a sea of faceless

1518
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,640
people is becoming our friends and it's

1519
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,229
becoming like family

1520
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,788
what do you do when you were asked to

1521
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:18,880
teach talk about something you're either

1522
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:21,740
don't know or aren't familiar whisk ah

1523
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,480
so one of the greatest ways to learn

1524
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:27,799
something is that to give a presentation

1525
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:29,359
on it like it really is is so that is my

1526
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:30,740
number one recommendation if someone

1527
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,690
asks you to presenting something you

1528
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,890
currently don't know and it gives you an

1529
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:35,599
opportunity to learn it

1530
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:37,400
same thing with content creation if

1531
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:40,039
there is something that you do want to

1532
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:42,200
learn plan to do a webcast on it six

1533
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:45,110
months from now and you're gonna give

1534
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,669
yourself a reason to learn it

1535
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:50,000
I will talk about this in a little bit

1536
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:52,010
but just during the break is that I and

1537
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,290
many of the people I know when they

1538
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:55,790
submit a CFP they have no idea how

1539
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,050
they're gonna do the research or how

1540
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:58,279
they're gonna build the slides or how

1541
00:58:57,050 --> 00:59:00,080
they're gonna put anything together

1542
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,700
they just submit a CFP for this thing

1543
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,110
that they want to do or this idea that

1544
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,540
they have this research that they want

1545
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:08,000
to do and then if they get accepted I

1546
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:11,150
know I have a deadline learn this thing

1547
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,050
so I would say

1548
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:14,820
so what do you do when you're asked to

1549
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:18,849
teach something not familiar was quickly

1550
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:22,209
learn it or asked not to present

1551
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:23,949
the only time now I don't say only time

1552
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:27,459
the time that I look really

1553
00:59:23,949 --> 00:59:30,309
uncomfortable presenting is on the one

1554
00:59:27,459 --> 00:59:31,660
slide that I don't know as well like all

1555
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:33,009
the other slides I'm like I'm good I'm

1556
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,449
good I'm good and then I get to the one

1557
00:59:33,009 --> 00:59:37,259
slide where I don't feel real confident

1558
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:41,529
about it I like internally I'm like

1559
00:59:37,259 --> 00:59:43,390
don't die like the anxiety shoots up my

1560
00:59:41,529 --> 00:59:46,929
heart starts racing more like yeah the

1561
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:48,848
room starts getting like so I would just

1562
00:59:46,929 --> 00:59:50,349
say that if you are presenting on

1563
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:51,999
something you don't know very well it's

1564
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:52,650
gonna show in the way that you're

1565
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:55,359
confident

1566
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:58,719
unless it's whose lot whose slide is it

1567
00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:01,179
anyway and then that's just fun we are

1568
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:03,429
going to try to figure out a way maybe

1569
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:04,929
not for this event but to be able to do

1570
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:08,330
a virtual who's slide is it any way

1571
01:00:04,929 --> 01:00:10,130
through discord and presenting

1572
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:11,870
all right how do you adapt your

1573
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:14,690
presentations a very young audiences

1574
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:17,480
like kids who don't swear I don't think

1575
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:19,790
I've sworn before heard this hello if I

1576
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,400
if I've sworn let me know when I

1577
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:24,410
generally teach when it especially when

1578
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,260
I talk college I just swore all the time

1579
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:29,390
is that I really felt like it got the

1580
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,860
students more engaged either they hated

1581
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,509
it and they paid attention because they

1582
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,680
hated it or they liked it and so they

1583
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:37,490
paid attention because I was being

1584
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:40,040
brutally honest like garyvee so how do

1585
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:41,270
you adapt to kids so change your

1586
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,630
anecdotes to things that they would

1587
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:46,850
understand what I mean by that is when I

1588
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:49,040
teach I think about my audience all the

1589
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:51,200
time so right now I am adapting

1590
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,570
everything that I'm talking about for

1591
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,450
the most part to InfoSec but I could do

1592
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,010
the same exact talk or somebody that

1593
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,540
worked in an automotive I could do the

1594
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:02,000
same exact talk for someone that worked

1595
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,230
in marketing I could do the same exact

1596
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,640
talk for people that worked in other

1597
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:07,190
industries and I would just start

1598
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,170
adjusting my stories my anecdotes my

1599
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:10,970
reasons is something that that audience

1600
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:12,800
would understand but when working with

1601
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:16,180
little kids you start thinking about you

1602
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,180
know what is their world like

1603
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:21,240
and and

1604
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:22,680
and I don't fit that how much time is

1605
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,540
too much time into creating content

1606
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:27,339
that's up to you and your schedule

1607
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:31,190
we'll get two into this in a little bit

1608
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:34,640
but one of the things is is

1609
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:36,920
don't publish anything until you've made

1610
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,210
a couple of those things and I'll give

1611
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,490
you an exact number here in a little

1612
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:42,260
while but don't publish anything until

1613
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:43,970
you've made a bunch and the reason why

1614
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:45,470
is because that first one you make might

1615
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,700
have taken you two weeks to create and

1616
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:47,868
then at the end of it you realize you

1617
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:50,060
don't have two weeks to make that thing

1618
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:52,840
and so all of a sudden you know you

1619
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:54,430
decide not to make stuff anymore

1620
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,560
what's the best way to reach out to

1621
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:58,509
people that you want the Siri content

1622
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,650
that's people aren't specifically

1623
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,210
looking for my youtube channel

1624
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:02,890
cybersecurity wareness channel I know a

1625
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:04,360
lot of people may not be interest but I

1626
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:06,250
want to increase awareness for the

1627
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,120
average person reaching these people

1628
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,960
seem to be difficult

1629
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:13,580
yeah

1630
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:16,670
so I would so in that situation finding

1631
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:18,290
people like that is you start looking

1632
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:21,349
for influential people in other

1633
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:24,320
industries so if you want to bring

1634
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:26,750
security awareness student but you call

1635
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:29,020
the average person then you would find

1636
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:31,460
someone that's already has an audience

1637
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:34,730
either through twitch or through

1638
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:37,220
Instagram or through other places and

1639
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:38,510
it's called influencer marketing and so

1640
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,459
what you do is you would reach out to

1641
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:42,800
them and say would it be possible for

1642
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:44,240
you to mention this to your audience

1643
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,339
because it's really beneficial to them

1644
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:50,140
and it can really help you and help your

1645
01:02:46,339 --> 01:02:52,880
audience learn about cybersecurity stuff

1646
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:55,009
so if you didn't catch that what I'm

1647
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,599
looking what you're looking for is other

1648
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:59,119
people in other industries that have

1649
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:00,830
influence and then you reach out to them

1650
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,170
and say would you be willing to share

1651
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:06,750
your influence with your audience to

1652
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:08,130
help this get out to that Ani

1653
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,660
you know of opportunities for learning

1654
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,250
or getting a mentorship for creating

1655
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,020
content like brainstorming content ideas

1656
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,020
turning those into draft content

1657
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:18,960
co-presenting son

1658
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:21,420
um telling

1659
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,940
let me think about that no it's not

1660
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:25,670
weird just let me think about the best

1661
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,559
way to get that

1662
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:30,319
all right so we lost a few and that's

1663
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:31,970
fine we lost a few people during the

1664
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:36,430
break

1665
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:39,950
to get ready to start back up here and

1666
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:44,480
Sue back to the imposter syndrome and

1667
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:48,290
back to the shyness is that I just like

1668
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,840
you if you're giving a talk in a live

1669
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:54,570
presentation and somebody gets up and

1670
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:57,450
leaves it hurts

1671
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:58,950
for some reason at first and what

1672
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:01,080
happens is they get up and they may hey

1673
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:01,890
but who lived Juma treason they gotta

1674
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,640
use the bathroom they got to go

1675
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:05,120
somewhere else they want to go to

1676
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:09,019
another talk they get up and leave and

1677
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:10,279
you're like this is something I said

1678
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:12,799
I've been better could have done

1679
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:15,109
something different and so you know we

1680
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,519
just lost a few people during the 10

1681
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:18,439
minute break and I was even thinking

1682
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,149
about that do I have this 10 minute

1683
01:04:18,439 --> 01:04:23,029
break because I might lose some people

1684
01:04:20,149 --> 01:04:26,078
but once again the people you lose are

1685
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:26,079
the people who

1686
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:30,649
you're not reaching or they wanted to go

1687
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,700
to another talk and so I have to

1688
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:34,880
understand

1689
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,879
heart

1690
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:41,340
and we're back

1691
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:43,740
webcast live are recorded so this is

1692
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,180
lead-in to what I just said about the

1693
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,990
people staying in the people going and

1694
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,049
all that stuff

1695
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:51,600
webcast so what is the webcast webcast

1696
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:54,180
normally a 60 minute or 30 minute where

1697
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,990
you're gonna cover a single topic so one

1698
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,540
of the things that you're going to need

1699
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:59,609
is a webcast platform at Black Hills we

1700
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:02,490
use GoToWebinar you could use

1701
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:04,350
GoToMeeting if you have a up to like

1702
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:06,689
depending on your accounts I think you

1703
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:07,920
can have between 50 to 250 people so if

1704
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:09,960
you don't think it's gonna be a lot of

1705
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,010
people showing up in the beginning you

1706
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,930
could just create a good a meeting

1707
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:14,640
account you can post a link out in your

1708
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:15,779
social media or wherever and say I'm

1709
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,490
going to cover this topic for a little

1710
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,990
while if you want to show up again it's

1711
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:19,500
going to be engaging I want answer your

1712
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:22,618
questions

1713
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:24,540
yes stuff like that but if you start

1714
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:27,300
getting into larger audiences to this

1715
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:29,040
year at Black Hills we started averaging

1716
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:32,430
more than a thousand people per webcast

1717
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:34,590
and like I kind of exploded like last

1718
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:36,569
year the average was about 500 to 600

1719
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:39,150
and then it kept growing and then now

1720
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:41,790
we're we're averaging one webcast was

1721
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:43,830
like 1500 people and stuff and the

1722
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:45,720
reason why I bring that up is because

1723
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:48,299
there is multiple tiers like you're not

1724
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,129
just a webcast for the people you but as

1725
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:51,300
you increase the amount of people you're

1726
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,890
talking to you also have to increase

1727
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:55,500
like an infrastructure answering

1728
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:56,430
questions and things like that so for

1729
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,170
those of you who are just getting

1730
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:00,540
started if you're doing webcast you can

1731
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:03,450
start with any platform while we were

1732
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,740
looking at we had like 6,000 people sign

1733
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:06,029
up for a free training class that we

1734
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,220
were doing we didn't know how to

1735
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:12,510
facilitate if all six thousand people

1736
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:15,299
showed up so we found a it was webinar

1737
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:16,230
jam alright so for those of you don't

1738
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,660
want to take a look at this figure

1739
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:21,540
there's a ton of platforms out there we

1740
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,649
liked webinar jam the only issue with

1741
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:25,460
webinar jam is that they have a

1742
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:28,590
vulnerability inside their platform and

1743
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:31,140
so until they fix that vulnerability

1744
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:33,270
we're not going to use it but webinar

1745
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,859
Jam is here you do it for like if you're

1746
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:37,050
doing a smaller we're doing an

1747
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:39,869
information security webcast and so to

1748
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:41,970
have a vulnerability in a platform was

1749
01:06:39,869 --> 01:06:44,010
not good for us but if you're doing a

1750
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:46,230
webcast on your hobby or something else

1751
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:48,090
that you like to do then maybe a webinar

1752
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:49,619
jam it's like $90 a month they can give

1753
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:51,420
you up to 5,000 people you probably

1754
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:54,270
start with a smaller tier

1755
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,830
but there's a lot of different services

1756
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:58,920
out there we just use GoToWebinar

1757
01:06:55,830 --> 01:07:01,080
because of stable and it's secure even

1758
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:04,380
we got hit by let's just call them

1759
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:08,460
Rooskies who were hitting us with a bot

1760
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:10,890
and they were filling up ours like our

1761
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:13,260
list of they were just they were

1762
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:14,549
registering everybody and so we reset

1763
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,930
the GoToWebinar and we said hey we're

1764
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:17,280
having this problem and so they created

1765
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:20,819
it they were in the middle of creating a

1766
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:23,430
CAPTCHA shut that stuff down and we

1767
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:24,360
became a bae beta user for that so what

1768
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:26,700
is the difference between live and

1769
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:28,710
recorded and I would tell you this it's

1770
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:31,850
the retention rate it's people's

1771
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:35,330
attention the retention rate for a live

1772
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:37,460
webcast is about 90 percent

1773
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:41,740
retention rate for a live webcast is

1774
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:45,830
about 90% the retention rate or eight a

1775
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:50,180
recorded webcast is 10% or less

1776
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:52,940
think about the the retention rate for a

1777
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:54,980
live webcast is 90 the retention rate

1778
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,360
for a recorded is 10 you know those are

1779
01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:00,260
people who go all the way through from

1780
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:02,210
beginning to end and why is that

1781
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:03,830
because you are a human being and I'm a

1782
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:05,930
human being and I'm currently speaking

1783
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:07,400
to you and you're hearing me and there's

1784
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:09,290
a chance that you can engage with me

1785
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,540
write a question we can go back and

1786
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:14,360
forth but what's it recorded that's not

1787
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:15,650
I'm just a video just like all the other

1788
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,359
videos on the internet and if it's not

1789
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:19,490
interesting to me after 30 seconds I'll

1790
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,740
just kill it but there's something about

1791
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:23,330
human to humans like if we see another

1792
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:25,160
human being we will give them our

1793
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:26,750
attention and it's the reason why in a

1794
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,930
live presentation if I'm up on stage

1795
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:31,399
generally people won't leave and the

1796
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:33,529
same thing for you if you're up on stage

1797
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:36,049
and giving a live presentation generally

1798
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:38,420
people won't leave it's because there is

1799
01:08:36,049 --> 01:08:40,729
something about us humans are like you

1800
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:41,870
know I'm just gonna stay I think it

1801
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:43,879
would be rude for me to get up and leave

1802
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:45,589
but it doesn't mean they're paying

1803
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:47,029
attention the fact that you're still

1804
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:48,620
here doesn't mean that you're actually

1805
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:50,630
watching me right now are looking at my

1806
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,979
slides it just means that you're here

1807
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,180
and so I know that you could be looking

1808
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:54,500
at other things you're doing work right

1809
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,720
now you're checking your email as your

1810
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,899
own this discord channel I still don't

1811
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:02,900
have your full attention but it's more

1812
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:04,580
than if I was recorded and so if I was

1813
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:06,200
going to encourage you to do anything I

1814
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:09,740
would say I would encourage you to do

1815
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:11,149
live webcast and live webcast can help

1816
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:12,649
you start building her mailing list and

1817
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:14,089
them as you build your mailing list or

1818
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:15,410
your discord channel especially if

1819
01:09:14,089 --> 01:09:16,970
you're doing twitch or some other

1820
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:19,670
live-streaming like YouTube live or

1821
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:22,250
something if you're doing live your

1822
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:23,870
sessions live streaming and those people

1823
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:25,700
are engaging with you and then you can

1824
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:28,580
say hey follow me on my discord channel

1825
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,990
or go enjoy my mailing list then those

1826
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:31,640
are the same people that when you go

1827
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:33,259
live again and you send out the email

1828
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:35,240
and say hey we're gonna live at this

1829
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:37,040
date at this time he'll show back up for

1830
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,719
the next one because you've given them

1831
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,910
something that they've beneficial to

1832
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,859
them it now journalized it they liked it

1833
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:44,450
it's good they pass it on to others and

1834
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:47,990
so you start building that community

1835
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:49,519
right there to live now doesn't mean you

1836
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:51,858
don't take your recording and put it up

1837
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:55,550
but that recording should point people

1838
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:57,380
to your next live offering so you would

1839
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:59,060
want that recording to constantly be

1840
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:01,850
pushing people to the live version

1841
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:05,450
because live is where the engaging part

1842
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:07,340
takes place so it'll get an account you

1843
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:09,860
can do use go to meeting you can go to

1844
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:11,990
do others and then what are you gonna do

1845
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:14,330
your webcast on

1846
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:15,230
whatever you really want to so telling

1847
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:18,920
you brought up a good point

1848
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:21,379
who do you brainstorm with and at Black

1849
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:24,080
Hills they have me they do and at some

1850
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:27,440
organizations I'm gonna put your name

1851
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:30,170
it's later later I know you're asking

1852
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,059
Guardians and so they have you and so

1853
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:34,850
one of the things I do is I reach out to

1854
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:36,470
staff and I say hey we need a webcast

1855
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:38,300
for this date what would you like to do

1856
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:39,650
it on and they're like I don't know I

1857
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,210
was like alright so what are you

1858
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,589
currently working on I like what I'm

1859
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,880
doing this how's it so what was

1860
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:45,620
something interesting in the last pen

1861
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,940
test report you know like well this was

1862
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:50,120
an interesting finding well how'd you

1863
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:51,860
find it like this way is that a tool

1864
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,150
that you're currently using mm-hmm is

1865
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,940
that a tool that other if you would want

1866
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:57,860
to know about like I think so okay cool

1867
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:59,540
so we're gonna do a webcast on this tool

1868
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:02,990
using this technique that you use on a

1869
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:04,430
recent pen test night okay and so it is

1870
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:08,210
beneficial to have someone to bounce

1871
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:11,380
ideas off of because if I'm sitting here

1872
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:13,510
right now and it's just me yeah

1873
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:15,970
posture syndromes gonna kick in super

1874
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:18,130
hard and I'm like well what about this I

1875
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:20,430
could do a show about that it all sounds

1876
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:25,570
like no one wants to hear you say that

1877
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:30,040
nobody would want to see that no yeah

1878
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:33,040
okay well it does help have somebody to

1879
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,540
bounce ideas off of and I will talk

1880
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,460
about this in a little bit but for your

1881
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,330
how-to videos it's always good to have

1882
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:39,880
someone else around

1883
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:42,670
Oh kelan and the rest of you if there's

1884
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,680
someone that you trust or their opinion

1885
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:46,780
and I would recommend that you reach out

1886
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:48,610
to them and say here's like the five

1887
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:51,280
ideas that I would like to do which one

1888
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:53,230
of those do you think is best or you ask

1889
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:56,769
them this question what's something that

1890
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:59,230
you wish you knew a year ago that you

1891
01:11:56,770 --> 01:12:00,940
currently know now

1892
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:02,769
and that's a good question to get people

1893
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:04,629
started with I wish I would have known

1894
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:07,270
it's about Metasploit I wish I would

1895
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:09,130
have known this about going hiking as my

1896
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:10,960
wife and I like to go hiking and one of

1897
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:13,180
the things that we do is that we learn

1898
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,800
about hiking through other blogs or

1899
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:16,030
through other people's websites and one

1900
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,030
of the things that we really like is

1901
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:23,500
there's a website an app called gut

1902
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:26,290
hooks or all trails and it's the reviews

1903
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:28,900
that people leave and so that's content

1904
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:30,130
you know if someone goes to a to a cabin

1905
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:32,650
and they're like this is the information

1906
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:34,090
about it cool thank you so much for

1907
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:37,000
sharing your knowledge with us before we

1908
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:38,980
get to that place and so I'm not just

1909
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,320
talking about InfoSec I'm talking about

1910
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:44,290
you have a so much that you know and

1911
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:47,049
other people could benefit from it live

1912
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:49,269
streaming this is new I took a class on

1913
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:51,400
lives training about four weeks ago and

1914
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:52,840
I know about live-streaming I know about

1915
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,280
Twitter know about YouTube and I know

1916
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:57,610
about gamers and I know about all these

1917
01:12:54,280 --> 01:13:00,550
people but I am 41 I realized that I'm

1918
01:12:57,610 --> 01:13:02,320
five years too old to be really good at

1919
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:04,570
this really

1920
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:07,120
but object like 43 and I do it it's like

1921
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:08,440
I know but I missed it just like my

1922
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,080
brother is seven years older than me and

1923
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:13,540
he missed the internet completely he was

1924
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:15,130
seven years older and by the time the

1925
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:17,440
internet came out he was already in his

1926
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:20,230
career so there's things that we miss

1927
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:21,820
it's just our age we don't catch it like

1928
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:24,009
discord there's some of you are using

1929
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:25,690
discord for the very first time and you

1930
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:28,180
are progressing Lee using it because

1931
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:29,500
you're a slack user and so I was talking

1932
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:32,620
to someone yesterday and it's like no I

1933
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:33,880
like swag and that's fine it's just that

1934
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,950
you know we've missed things we have to

1935
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,800
be taught by other people so I took a

1936
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:40,059
class a couple weeks ago and black boots

1937
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,290
was really cool and I said I want to

1938
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:44,380
take some training they're like what on

1939
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:46,630
and I was like streaming click okay it

1940
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:48,040
proved it I flew a former student of

1941
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:50,440
mine so it's a guy that I taught 12

1942
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:51,910
years ago at film school I'd gone in the

1943
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:56,559
streaming direction so he's now

1944
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:57,820
streaming in that industry and I saw

1945
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,320
what he was doing I saw the work that he

1946
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:01,269
was creating and I said could you come

1947
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:02,920
teach me and so I recommend this for you

1948
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,239
all to if you see someone out there

1949
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,980
that's doing something interesting you

1950
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:08,410
can bring him on as a consultant no

1951
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:10,269
please teach me what you know and so he

1952
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:13,090
came in and did this class on live

1953
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:14,650
streaming and I learned a lot

1954
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:18,119
one of the things I learned was twitch

1955
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:20,710
has a section if you twitch that TV

1956
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:23,860
right now I am blind from looking at the

1957
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:28,090
light there are all these different

1958
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:33,240
sections whoa there's it all kinds of

1959
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:34,740
twitch is Jenna okay dog

1960
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:37,110
so just chatting it's a place that you

1961
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:38,280
would want to be so just chatting is

1962
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,900
where you can talk about anything that

1963
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,460
you want to cover and the reason I was

1964
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:43,080
just because I know that there's gonna

1965
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:44,610
be a recording here and I don't know

1966
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:49,380
what's there and I didn't want to look

1967
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:50,639
at it too long so which is fine I can't

1968
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,770
imagine what the discord saying right

1969
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,840
now so live streaming you would be in

1970
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:57,420
the just chatting section so this court

1971
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:59,700
I mean twitch in the beginning was all

1972
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:01,170
that gamers it was a gamers doing gaming

1973
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,670
stuff and people watching other people

1974
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:04,650
play games and that could be the

1975
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:06,120
contents you create but they did start a

1976
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:07,769
section called just chatting and just

1977
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,890
chatting as any topic whatsoever there's

1978
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:13,740
a guy who's a mechanic and he does a

1979
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:15,990
livestream of his being a mechanic all

1980
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:18,179
day and the cars come in the cars leave

1981
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:19,769
but when the cars come in he does a

1982
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,480
diagnostic check he walks up to the

1983
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:23,340
camera he talks through what it is and

1984
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,870
he has a thing where if you pay to be a

1985
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,700
subscriber you can ask him any question

1986
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:28,710
and so for people who are learning about

1987
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,990
being a mechanic or learning about

1988
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:32,430
automotive work they pay some money to

1989
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:33,719
be a subscriber and they ask his

1990
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:35,730
question and then he answers their

1991
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:38,520
questions and so that's just something

1992
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:41,400
that he does so if there's a topic or a

1993
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,740
hobby or InfoSec even and you want it to

1994
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:46,710
be a live twitch streamer or a youtube

1995
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:48,090
streamer then you can do that so what

1996
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:51,060
was the big thing that I took away from

1997
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:55,230
that class you didn't ask me that but

1998
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:57,780
I'm gonna tell you anyway is by the well

1999
01:15:55,230 --> 01:16:01,230
the big things was this camera that

2000
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:02,790
you're currently seeing we use that

2001
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:03,929
this microphone we already have so if

2002
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:05,640
you're like what do you use and you

2003
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:08,550
sound really great now thank you so much

2004
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:12,120
so we use this camera if you want to get

2005
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:13,590
that and we use this microphone fiver is

2006
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:17,190
a great place to get the graphics made

2007
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:21,360
for your streaming Channel

2008
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:23,129
and then it's that I spent if it wasn't

2009
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,110
for that class a couple weeks ago we

2010
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:28,230
would not have been ready for this

2011
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:30,509
virtual conference this week it totally

2012
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:32,820
wouldn't didn't know a lot of things

2013
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:34,500
that we were currently using and the

2014
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:36,480
discord channel which feels like it's

2015
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,520
pulling this whole con together in one

2016
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:41,400
place was something that I learned a

2017
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,739
couple weeks ago and once again I'm 41 I

2018
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,009
didn't know about this cord he taught it

2019
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:48,989
to me I saw the capabilities I saw them

2020
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:51,090
the ability to pull it together and so

2021
01:16:48,989 --> 01:16:53,730
we built this discord on like Monday

2022
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:55,350
evening and sent out the invites just

2023
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:57,809
because of that class so what was the

2024
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:59,730
biggest takeaway from I think the

2025
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:02,570
biggest takeaway from that was how easy

2026
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:02,570
it was to stream

2027
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:07,610
looking for software to do it did a

2028
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:10,969
stream labs for those of you that have a

2029
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:14,880
PC or you're going to use OBS if you

2030
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:16,469
have a Mac is that I

2031
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,420
thought streaming would be difficult

2032
01:17:16,469 --> 01:17:20,460
because the last time I tried the stream

2033
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:22,500
or do work like this was about six or

2034
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:24,659
seven years ago and the computers just

2035
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,489
could not do the things that I wanted to

2036
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:27,599
do my head like I wanted so look like

2037
01:17:26,489 --> 01:17:30,629
listen I won't do that

2038
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,429
and so my I was basically my knowledge

2039
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:34,350
on the things that I saw years ago and

2040
01:17:32,429 --> 01:17:37,020
so what happened was this consultant guy

2041
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:38,400
sat down and he started showing me and

2042
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:40,020
he showed me stream labs he showed me

2043
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,159
OBS and he showed me how you can pull

2044
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,679
these different streams in and how you

2045
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:45,330
can do this and I was like it's it's all

2046
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,530
in real time isn't it he's like yeah

2047
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,389
it's just real time you just drag this

2048
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:52,610
over here he hit stream you can just

2049
01:17:48,389 --> 01:17:54,620
drag it while it's real time on your

2050
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:57,469
laptop

2051
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:59,330
oh my god this is so easy and it really

2052
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:00,920
was that the biggest takeaway from the

2053
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:03,769
entire class was how easy it was to

2054
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:05,990
stream and so

2055
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:08,060
just something to give you as a takeaway

2056
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:11,469
tell easy dream labs

2057
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:15,880
oh screen deck so we just bought this at

2058
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:15,880
Black Hills and we haven't used it yet

2059
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:20,300
stream deck

2060
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:24,790
this right here inside stream labs and

2061
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,040
inside OBS you can build these think

2062
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:29,470
caught scenes and then you can map these

2063
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,269
scenes and cameras and everything to the

2064
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:33,190
actual buttons on here and so while

2065
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:34,840
you're streaming you can just hit the

2066
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:36,580
buttons on your stream lab and it will

2067
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:39,310
take you from camera one number two or

2068
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:41,890
take you from the camera and your slides

2069
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:43,870
to just a shot of you or it would take

2070
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:45,730
you to a camera above showing your

2071
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:46,840
keyboard it will take you to you know

2072
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:49,269
something if you're doing hardware

2073
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,800
hacking it would take you to whatever or

2074
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:52,570
if you have this really cold transition

2075
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:56,770
at each you and that you get made on

2076
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:58,840
fibre that takes you from like and like

2077
01:18:56,770 --> 01:19:00,640
your production value just goes up so

2078
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,440
stream duct is what we'll be using in

2079
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,120
the next couple weeks we would ease the

2080
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:06,019
sooner but I went on a cruise and then

2081
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:08,080
we had this virtual

2082
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,970
right

2083
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:12,840
saying that's a bad thing that's what

2084
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:14,970
happened all right how to videos

2085
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:17,790
all right how to videos are different

2086
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:21,120
these are the three to nine minutes

2087
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:22,650
single topic on how to do something when

2088
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,760
I first came to Black Hills I was like

2089
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:27,839
hey John we need to make these how-to

2090
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:31,830
videos and there was a bit of a culture

2091
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:33,330
shift from what we were doing because if

2092
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:35,910
you're used to doing these long-form

2093
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:37,950
pieces of content doing something short

2094
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:39,030
just feels weird but if you start doing

2095
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:40,050
something short than doing something

2096
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:43,530
long would probably feel weird

2097
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:45,070
so we got these seven minutes single

2098
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:47,139
topics

2099
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:49,750
and it's real basic it's getting started

2100
01:19:47,139 --> 01:19:52,239
with basic google searches it's got some

2101
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:55,900
information here brought to you by this

2102
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:57,879
is 7 minutes and 32 seconds and if you

2103
01:19:55,900 --> 01:20:00,610
take a look I'll show you the numbers

2104
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:02,980
here the numbers for our long forms 800

2105
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:04,960
there also

2106
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:08,739
the numbers for our short film content

2107
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:10,960
is pretty good too the difference is the

2108
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:13,660
long-form content the 60-minute stuff

2109
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:16,449
has that 10 percent retention rate the

2110
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:19,510
short form content has 50 to 60 percent

2111
01:20:16,449 --> 01:20:21,190
tension rate retention rate and so there

2112
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:21,940
are people who just start it and go this

2113
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:23,949
isn't for me

2114
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:25,330
and so that kills us right there but for

2115
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:27,040
the majority of the people they're going

2116
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:31,300
all the way through to the end and so

2117
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:32,590
somebody will give you you if you think

2118
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,940
it's gonna be good for you will give

2119
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,949
someone at least four minutes on the

2120
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:37,509
internet bill four minutes is an

2121
01:20:35,949 --> 01:20:39,099
eternity you know why I know four

2122
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:41,230
minutes is an eternity on the Internet

2123
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:43,000
there's a five-second commercial before

2124
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:45,910
a YouTube video feels like the longest

2125
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,370
thing in the world and so four minutes

2126
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:49,900
is an eternity and so if you're making a

2127
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:51,400
four minute how-to video just remember

2128
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:53,259
that the majority of people will get

2129
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,719
through it because they think you're

2130
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:57,640
gonna teach them something but some

2131
01:20:55,719 --> 01:20:59,469
people won't so if you're making a 60

2132
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:00,880
minute thing but and you make a 60

2133
01:20:59,469 --> 01:21:03,580
minute thing and then break it into

2134
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,590
smaller five to ten minute things that

2135
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:06,190
content chunking coming to the smaller

2136
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:10,239
pieces

2137
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:12,639
alright so shorter form content is the

2138
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:15,879
how-to videos you're the Internet's full

2139
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:18,120
with them be and then whenever you

2140
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:20,160
create the title

2141
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:22,860
there's there's some back-and-forth

2142
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:26,070
between using the actual word how to how

2143
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:27,870
to or getting started with that's all

2144
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:30,120
back to the SEO what are people

2145
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:32,610
searching for so if someone searching

2146
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:34,440
for how to use Metasploit that might be

2147
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:36,240
you call it how they use Metasploit or

2148
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,040
how to use this tool inside Metasploit

2149
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:41,309
how they uses exploits inside medically

2150
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:43,350
how to use this inside cobalt strike how

2151
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:46,530
to use this like what is the thing that

2152
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:47,670
you can show people how to use and does

2153
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:48,300
that become the title of your how-to

2154
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:51,480
video

2155
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:53,940
now you can amass a massive audience

2156
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:56,309
with how-to videos because I see it all

2157
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:58,110
the time on YouTube there are like I get

2158
01:21:56,310 --> 01:22:00,540
a little YouTube jealous when I see that

2159
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:02,400
this one channel of them on Metasploit

2160
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:04,769
how to use has like 1.2 million

2161
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:07,679
subscribers and we have like 10,000 but

2162
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:09,420
I'm like that's good Jason you don't

2163
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:11,220
have to compare yourself to them all the

2164
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:13,020
time it's okay but these how-to videos

2165
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:15,360
will build a larger subscriber base

2166
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:17,610
I believe faster than long-form content

2167
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,139
the long-form content is really good at

2168
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:20,429
building that relationship so if people

2169
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,110
watch all over to the end they start

2170
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:23,310
becoming like family and it's become

2171
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:25,740
like family but there's how two people

2172
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:30,390
you know they have a larger audience for

2173
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:31,700
that next video blogs a blogs the Black

2174
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:33,290
Hills

2175
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:37,340
a lot of blogs we currently have like

2176
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:39,110
400 and some but every journey starts

2177
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:41,240
with a single step so if you go all the

2178
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:45,190
way back to the very first blog and all

2179
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:45,190
eternity written I

2180
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:52,099
Douglas and so your very first blog will

2181
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:53,960
be zero zero zero one if you haven't

2182
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:56,750
written one before and you will create a

2183
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:58,880
Twitter out Twitter post and they

2184
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:00,140
LinkedIn post why is it different

2185
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,130
yeah because the format's a little

2186
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:04,360
difference and you don't want to just

2187
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:04,360
copy and paste it from one to the other

2188
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:10,410
so yeah

2189
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:12,900
so your journey to a hundred blogs or so

2190
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:14,400
will start with a single one what are

2191
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:18,299
you gonna write on

2192
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,769
I don't know that's your first step the

2193
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:21,750
one thing about blog writing though is

2194
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:23,430
everyone who writes a blog writes a blog

2195
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:25,800
on how to write a blog now I'm not gonna

2196
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:28,490
tell you how to write a blog but if you

2197
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:31,110
go and watch that talk that I gave at

2198
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:33,900
derbycon a few years ago I think it's

2199
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:35,549
here yeah a presentation or presenting

2200
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,290
presentations because presenting if you

2201
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:39,000
go back and watch that it will give you

2202
01:23:37,290 --> 01:23:41,160
a really good structure for how to do a

2203
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,560
hook a beginning a middle a climax and

2204
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:45,330
an end to your blog and how you follow

2205
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,890
that format of asking a question of your

2206
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:48,240
audience and how you answer that

2207
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:50,880
question at the end of how you give a

2208
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,349
takeaway now you hopefully inspire them

2209
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,360
to want to learn something new like

2210
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:56,550
here's a follow that format that's in

2211
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:58,700
that webcast tonight good place to get

2212
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:58,700
you started

2213
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:06,350
okay so back to the what do you call

2214
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:09,170
your blog do you want to call it how to

2215
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:11,480
do something when I first came to Black

2216
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:13,160
Hills and I apologize to all the testers

2217
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:15,058
is I started making them change the

2218
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:17,110
names of their blogs

2219
01:24:15,059 --> 01:24:18,159
because what we learned is that anything

2220
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:20,499
that started with the words how to

2221
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:22,179
became very successful anything that

2222
01:24:20,499 --> 01:24:25,090
started with like creating the next

2223
01:24:22,179 --> 01:24:26,590
generation of interns like how to create

2224
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:28,150
the next generation of interns would be

2225
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:29,440
way better than creating the next

2226
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:31,388
generation of insurance you see the

2227
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,638
difference is that people don't search

2228
01:24:31,389 --> 01:24:36,219
for a lot of these things but if it did

2229
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:38,670
say how to do something and we could

2230
01:24:36,219 --> 01:24:41,079
shoot show data-driven decision making

2231
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:43,869
that anything that started with held to

2232
01:24:41,079 --> 01:24:46,030
was getting a lot more organic search

2233
01:24:43,869 --> 01:24:47,619
results to Google and so that's

2234
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:50,469
something to keep in mind is that you

2235
01:24:47,619 --> 01:24:52,329
you and I me we have these cool titles

2236
01:24:50,469 --> 01:24:54,219
we want to give something but that not

2237
01:24:52,329 --> 01:24:56,018
might not necessarily be the thing that

2238
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:58,019
draws people in and gets them to find

2239
01:24:56,019 --> 01:25:01,059
your plug and if your sole purpose is to

2240
01:24:58,019 --> 01:25:03,039
get back and you want more people to be

2241
01:25:01,059 --> 01:25:05,139
able to read it if usual purpose is to

2242
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:06,219
make money then you definitely want more

2243
01:25:05,139 --> 01:25:07,929
people to read it and if your sole

2244
01:25:06,219 --> 01:25:09,340
purpose to build your career and once

2245
01:25:07,929 --> 01:25:12,550
again you want more people to read it so

2246
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:14,619
if you can just adjust the title of your

2247
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:15,999
blog and some of the the wording inside

2248
01:25:14,619 --> 01:25:18,329
the blog itself and that just creates

2249
01:25:15,999 --> 01:25:20,650
more people to come back or you and

2250
01:25:18,329 --> 01:25:23,590
that's cool I'm going to show you this

2251
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:26,030
LM and and arm like I had no idea what

2252
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:28,040
this meant when I first got here

2253
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:31,099
but I do now and the reason why is

2254
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:33,590
because it is the first blog right you

2255
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:37,060
have the Wikipedia and then you have

2256
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:39,530
black holes this is the single most

2257
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:41,600
traffic blog on the black holes website

2258
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:44,000
every single week and every single month

2259
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,710
regardless of what we do this gets more

2260
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,690
traffic than anything else on the

2261
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:50,180
website and it's just when someone does

2262
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:51,620
this and it's how to disable MMR and why

2263
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:54,170
you would want to but anyone that

2264
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:56,240
doesn't search for Ella MNR it will find

2265
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:59,270
her blog and it leads to a massive

2266
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:04,570
amount of traffic for us

2267
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:04,570
all right et tu tu tutitu

2268
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:11,080
Podcast

2269
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:12,850
yeah if you haven't listened to darknet

2270
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,180
diaries definitely go listen to dr.

2271
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:16,430
cards

2272
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:18,130
they do podcast really well but that is

2273
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:21,170
not the type of podcast you're gonna do

2274
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:22,850
the goal is not the to do someone else's

2275
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:24,650
podcast the goal is to create your own

2276
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:26,030
and it's gonna take a little while for

2277
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:28,219
you to get over the sound of your own

2278
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:29,300
voice so once you get over the sound of

2279
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:31,400
your own voice then you can actually

2280
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:34,190
start settling into what your topics are

2281
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,780
gonna be and what's gonna be about and I

2282
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:37,879
said a little earlier don't publish

2283
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:40,400
anything don't tell anyone that you're

2284
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,860
starting a blog don't wait up

2285
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:45,440
don't wait up Twitter for your podcast

2286
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:48,139
don't go out and start marketing this

2287
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:51,349
thing that you haven't made yet and what

2288
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:54,710
I mean by that is I would like you to

2289
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:56,480
create 20 of something before you start

2290
01:26:54,710 --> 01:27:01,610
sharing it

2291
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:04,250
so create 20 podcast 220 fully edited

2292
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:05,960
finished podcast and if you like Jason

2293
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:09,470
but that seems like a lot of work

2294
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:11,180
without any reward yeah it is

2295
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:13,010
I mean if you want to go be a live

2296
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:14,300
twitch streamer you can start in the

2297
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:15,740
beginning you won't have an audience so

2298
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,300
it's probably gonna take the 20th time

2299
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:19,880
of you doing that live twitch train

2300
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:24,110
before anyone actually shows up but do

2301
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:25,670
20 of something do 20 blogs I mean you

2302
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:27,110
can invite people to your webcast but if

2303
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:30,410
they don't show up you still give it and

2304
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:33,320
the reason why is because you're going

2305
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:36,530
to leave this workshop and I've seen it

2306
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:38,990
I jeff McJunkin if you're in here you've

2307
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:41,300
seen it too when you get done teaching

2308
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:44,000
people something they're really excited

2309
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:45,860
about when I taught filmmaking I talked

2310
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,310
content creation and Tut yeah all that

2311
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:49,759
stuff

2312
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:52,700
I wouldn't like the students was like

2313
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,020
sketchy dance class go mix them and a

2314
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,400
lot of them did like they would leave

2315
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:56,870
the class they start making something

2316
01:27:55,400 --> 01:28:01,309
but I'm telling you right now that the

2317
01:27:56,870 --> 01:28:02,840
motivation and the desire I'm currently

2318
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:05,050
expressing to you and that you're

2319
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:09,870
feeling inside it's not gonna last long

2320
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:12,330
by Monday it will be gone it really will

2321
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:13,920
I'm trying to instill in you that if you

2322
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:15,180
this is something you want to do then go

2323
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,920
make twenty or something before you

2324
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:19,380
release it because if not you're gonna

2325
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,580
have a blog that has one block and the

2326
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:23,400
blog is going to say I'm getting ready

2327
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:25,140
to start my blog or your podcast that

2328
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:27,929
you start on iTunes is going to be like

2329
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:29,340
your first podcast that you actually get

2330
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:30,780
up you're gonna have the account for it

2331
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:33,270
but you don't actually have the podcast

2332
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:34,860
for it as you as you realize as I'm

2333
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:36,360
making this podcast I'm watching other

2334
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:38,309
podcasts I'm listening to other podcasts

2335
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:41,059
on how to make podcasts as I'm doing

2336
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:43,320
this but I don't have the time for it

2337
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:44,790
you don't you don't have the time to do

2338
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,019
the OSINT you don't have time to do the

2339
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:48,450
interviews you don't have time to do

2340
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:49,470
this and so I want you to make twenty of

2341
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:50,670
something before you start publishing

2342
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:52,680
and start telling people about it

2343
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:55,170
because it's gonna take 20 for you to

2344
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:57,300
get it down it's gonna take 20 blogs for

2345
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:58,860
you to get it to where you start finding

2346
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:00,840
your voice and and how you want

2347
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:02,910
structure what you want to do so it's

2348
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:04,560
gonna take a little while you are going

2349
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:05,670
to be motivated leaving this it you know

2350
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,350
there's forty eight of you that are

2351
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:08,580
stuck around so I'm guessing the forty

2352
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:10,200
eight of you are pretty motivated and

2353
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:11,490
you're thinking about the stuff and

2354
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,599
you're journalizing all right now and

2355
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:14,670
you're trying to figure out how to apply

2356
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:17,360
it to yourself and that's going to run

2357
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:19,700
out real soon

2358
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:22,370
one of the coolest things that happened

2359
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:24,980
after a talk like this at Derby con is a

2360
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:28,800
guy reached out and won Twitter and he

2361
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:31,349
said I've written my third blog Jason

2362
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,120
17 more to go

2363
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:35,270
about ten and he's like alright um oh

2364
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:37,920
and Seth like this is not easy I

2365
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:40,350
understand I'm excited for you to hit

2366
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,360
that twenty I will let you know that

2367
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:44,190
he's never written me to let me know

2368
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:46,110
that he hit his twenty and I'm not

2369
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:47,460
saying you don't release those seven you

2370
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:49,080
don't release those twelve because it

2371
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:51,270
would be something that's really helpful

2372
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:54,450
with other people and it could be

2373
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:56,430
absolutely release them if you get to

2374
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:57,990
seven and he can't go any further just

2375
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:59,850
put him out there so if people learn

2376
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:01,830
from them but if this is something that

2377
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:04,380
you want to do consistently and as a

2378
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:06,960
career as a way of giving back and it

2379
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,220
has to become scheduled and it has to

2380
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,560
become something that she create

2381
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:13,290
regardless how difficult it is now

2382
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,200
hopefully I haven't killed your desire

2383
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:19,010
to want to do this but I've given you a

2384
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:19,010
perspective on how to move forward

2385
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:26,270
you if you got a chance and I hope you

2386
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,589
saw Derek or Jeff's this morning I hope

2387
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:28,610
you were tuning into the ones this

2388
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:32,960
afternoon

2389
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:35,150
you know yesterday or is that yeah I am

2390
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:37,400
hopefully there's 48 of you that are

2391
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:40,339
currently listening to this I hope you

2392
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,809
decide to submit a CFP for a future talk

2393
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:44,630
especially awhile this hacking fest we'd

2394
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:46,100
love to have you good presentation that

2395
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:48,770
you give a presentation that you submit

2396
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:50,060
to do that and it's gonna do a lot of

2397
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:51,590
things like we already talked about is

2398
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:52,820
that it's gonna force you to do the

2399
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:54,440
research it's gonna force you to learn

2400
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:56,449
something but it's also gonna force you

2401
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,889
to get out of your comfort zone because

2402
01:30:56,449 --> 01:30:59,120
when I did that raise your hand if

2403
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:02,090
you're shot if you actually raise your

2404
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:05,000
hands that yeah you know there is that I

2405
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:06,830
gotta be brave there's a talk coming up

2406
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,140
I gotta get up on stage I have to show

2407
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:10,580
this information and that's gonna give

2408
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:13,040
you an opportunity to grow and stretch

2409
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:14,750
yourself as a person but how do you give

2410
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,460
a live presentation you'll watch the

2411
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:18,890
video on how to give a live presentation

2412
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:20,870
it's 30 minutes long and it will break

2413
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:23,000
it down for you from the hook beginning

2414
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:25,610
middle climax and end how to structure

2415
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,020
your your talk and even how to take a

2416
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:28,790
blank sheet of paper because I hate

2417
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,380
blank sheets of paper because blank

2418
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:33,769
sheets of paper laughing at me and

2419
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:35,060
they're like you don't have an idea so

2420
01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:37,190
the way I've gotten around that is I

2421
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:40,969
just write the word hook beginning

2422
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:43,219
middle I max and end on a blank sheet of

2423
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:45,590
paper and I start filling in those

2424
01:31:43,219 --> 01:31:47,390
sections and then as I start filling in

2425
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:48,949
those sections the hook is here's my

2426
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:51,170
question to the audience the beginning

2427
01:31:48,949 --> 01:31:53,389
is here's a journey that I went on to

2428
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:55,489
learn and to know more about this topic

2429
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:58,580
here's the the middle here's the

2430
01:31:55,489 --> 01:32:00,349
pitfalls and the highs and the lows of

2431
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:02,929
doing that research and figuring out

2432
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:05,090
this new thing climax is how it applies

2433
01:32:02,929 --> 01:32:06,380
to the audience because if you give a

2434
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:08,280
talk and you don't tell the audience how

2435
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:10,500
this applies to you

2436
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,759
that's just a terrible talk because the

2437
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,350
people just sat out there and just watch

2438
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,210
you just ramble on about something you

2439
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:18,360
thought was cool but it doesn't apply to

2440
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:19,710
them and so that climax is how does it

2441
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,960
apply to the audience and then the end

2442
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:23,910
is the you know tried to inspire try to

2443
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,320
give someone to take away and try to to

2444
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:28,290
wrap up everything that was most

2445
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:30,299
important in your talk so Ellis story if

2446
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:32,970
you don't know how to give a talk and

2447
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:35,610
this you know the whole world just shut

2448
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:37,290
down right now because of a pandemic but

2449
01:32:35,610 --> 01:32:40,349
if you're watching this recording and

2450
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:44,820
things have gotten better then I want

2451
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:46,980
you to join a local Toastmasters club so

2452
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:50,309
Toastmasters is a place where you can go

2453
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:53,190
and speak it's a pretty safe space for

2454
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:55,710
you go and speak there are very casual

2455
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:57,719
Toastmasters groups there's more strict

2456
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:59,400
with like sergeants of arms to type

2457
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:01,680
Toastmasters group so try a couple out

2458
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:03,570
and you're it in a community but what I

2459
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,710
want you to do is is join a toast if you

2460
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:05,910
want to become a better speaker if you

2461
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:08,190
want to get off on stage if you want to

2462
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:09,300
give presentations internally or to the

2463
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:10,980
public if you want to do a Twitter

2464
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,210
stream anything that you want to do that

2465
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:14,190
you want to use your voice and talk to

2466
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:16,410
an audience and I highly recommend

2467
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:18,330
joining a Toastmasters and this will be

2468
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:20,220
a place where you can practice you can

2469
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:21,870
come up with talks they have a pathway I

2470
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:24,630
think it's even called path yeah it's

2471
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:26,760
pathways pathways is your first talk is

2472
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:28,680
the icebreaker talk the second talk is

2473
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,840
an informative talk the third talk is a

2474
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:32,490
persuasive talk the fourth talk is this

2475
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,740
type of talk the fifth talk is you give

2476
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:37,210
the talk you get feedback then you give

2477
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:39,160
the talk again

2478
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:40,989
it's an organization that can help you

2479
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:43,120
become a better speaker and presenter I

2480
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:44,950
really like Toastmasters I became a

2481
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,750
better speaker and presenter just by

2482
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:48,070
doing it every single time in the

2483
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:49,510
classroom and by the students having

2484
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:51,700
laptops and just trying to figure out

2485
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:53,650
how can i hack their brains to get them

2486
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:55,480
to care more about me researching and

2487
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:57,700
learning about how the human brain how

2488
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,259
human beings interpret information as

2489
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:01,179
you're as you're teaching it to him so I

2490
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:03,190
wanted to become a better presenter and

2491
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:05,530
speaker right that was my goal and that

2492
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:07,059
was my job in my profession so if this

2493
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:08,440
isn't your job and profession that I was

2494
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:10,870
just joined to look with Toastmasters

2495
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:12,759
and that would be a way that you can

2496
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:14,300
start learning and be a better presenter

2497
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:17,750
and speaker

2498
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:19,460
if P submissions once again now that you

2499
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:20,780
have an idea for a talk or you see

2500
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:21,950
places that you want to give talks him

2501
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:23,719
right now there is no place to go to

2502
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:26,630
talk unless it's virtually is everyone

2503
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:28,250
this postponed I am dude I'm a sponsor

2504
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:29,960
of all these events and I'm just getting

2505
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:32,120
the emails right now like and we're

2506
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:33,560
postponed and we're canceling right now

2507
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:36,380
it might be few and far between for the

2508
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:38,660
the CFP submissions but when it is time

2509
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:40,700
to present or if you sort of want to do

2510
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:41,780
a virtual con and more virtual concert

2511
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:44,090
popping up because we are doing a

2512
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:46,190
webcast this upcoming Monday on how to

2513
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:47,510
run a virtual con and it's just gonna be

2514
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:48,980
a brain dump of all the things that we

2515
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:53,210
learned over the last seven or eight

2516
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:54,589
days if you submit your CFP submit it

2517
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:58,070
like this

2518
01:34:54,590 --> 01:35:01,159
and the O's thing the only place I ever

2519
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:04,489
get rejected to speak is that marketing

2520
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:06,799
events the only place I really did

2521
01:35:04,489 --> 01:35:09,559
speaks at marketing events and really

2522
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:11,929
it's because I'm not paying as presented

2523
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:13,730
marketers unless you're kind of in the

2524
01:35:11,929 --> 01:35:15,260
club and I know you what you're thinking

2525
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:18,409
you got to be in the InfoSec Club which

2526
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:20,210
is why b-sides is so important to the

2527
01:35:18,409 --> 01:35:22,219
InfoSec industry is giving new voices

2528
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:24,380
and new speakers a chance to get up and

2529
01:35:22,219 --> 01:35:26,330
present so when you submit your CFP

2530
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:28,130
follow those five rules to hook

2531
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:30,800
beginning middle climax and end so it's

2532
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:32,210
the there's here's the the question to

2533
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,520
the audience here's the journey I went

2534
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:36,139
on here's what I learned or what I will

2535
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,670
learn by doing the research here's how

2536
01:35:36,139 --> 01:35:41,060
it applies to the audience and here's

2537
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:42,349
and then you sum it all up all the CFPs

2538
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:44,420
I've ever submitted in the InfoSec

2539
01:35:42,349 --> 01:35:46,250
industry had been accepted I think it's

2540
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:48,199
because if I was a pretty simple like

2541
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:49,610
the person who's reading it think about

2542
01:35:48,199 --> 01:35:51,440
the person reading it that's the

2543
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:54,320
audience that this person's getting like

2544
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,769
a thousand CFP use another which one do

2545
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,480
I take

2546
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:57,800
and it's the one that's just broken down

2547
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:00,409
and the easiest way for them to

2548
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:03,429
interpret and read if you send a stack

2549
01:36:00,409 --> 01:36:06,330
of papers oh my god so it's a five

2550
01:36:03,429 --> 01:36:08,130
breakdown

2551
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:09,960
my time today I won't be able to get to

2552
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:13,680
do this so I'm gonna jump over to

2553
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:16,020
marketing and if you're wondering what

2554
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:18,570
slides I just went through in my live

2555
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:21,210
version of this I run through someone's

2556
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:23,280
idea and then we actually run through

2557
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:24,870
all the ways to create that idea you

2558
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:27,330
know do we do live versus capture do we

2559
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:29,640
build a studio do we do screen capture

2560
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:31,470
actually exit I will do this and I'll

2561
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:34,530
just run through mallow faster tip if

2562
01:36:31,470 --> 01:36:38,100
you make a video or you make a how-to

2563
01:36:34,530 --> 01:36:40,990
video don't remake it so if you make it

2564
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:42,670
don't remake

2565
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:44,620
that 20 that you're creating and

2566
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:47,410
everything why you don't remake it is

2567
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:48,610
because just make the next one it just

2568
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:51,250
makes the next one after that just make

2569
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:53,889
them and they will get better as time

2570
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:56,980
goes on but if you're trying to make the

2571
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:58,150
best video alright like let me record

2572
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:59,440
that let me get different lighting when

2573
01:36:58,150 --> 01:37:01,299
we get this let me get that let me get

2574
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,769
this and just keep making the same video

2575
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:05,890
over and over again then you will have

2576
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:07,960
one video to make 20 videos that

2577
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:09,370
increasingly get better instead of

2578
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:12,750
making one that you're trying to make

2579
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:14,440
perfect so don't redo I had a

2580
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:15,490
photographer friend of mine that we

2581
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:17,589
would go out and do these photo shoots

2582
01:37:15,490 --> 01:37:19,769
and I keep touching my face even though

2583
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:19,770
I have

2584
01:37:19,949 --> 01:37:24,539
so we had this photographer that I would

2585
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:25,949
work with and whenever we'd get done

2586
01:37:24,539 --> 01:37:27,780
with the shoot you know we do the photo

2587
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:29,369
shoot we have the models we have the the

2588
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:31,409
client we have the product we have

2589
01:37:29,369 --> 01:37:33,539
whatever it is that we're shooting when

2590
01:37:31,409 --> 01:37:34,739
we would get done with the shoot he

2591
01:37:33,539 --> 01:37:37,499
would always reach out and say like hey

2592
01:37:34,739 --> 01:37:39,209
can we shoot that again no we can't

2593
01:37:37,499 --> 01:37:41,099
shoot it again and the reason why it

2594
01:37:39,209 --> 01:37:42,329
still on the drive home he kept thinking

2595
01:37:41,099 --> 01:37:43,320
about why I would have moved the light

2596
01:37:42,329 --> 01:37:45,420
here I would have done this differently

2597
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:47,940
on this I would it had this different

2598
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:49,769
angle and he can't you can't go back and

2599
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:51,360
redo it you can just make improvements

2600
01:37:49,769 --> 01:37:52,949
for the next one if you're doing

2601
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,780
post-production the tip here is to

2602
01:37:52,949 --> 01:37:56,848
outsource if you're doing your own

2603
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:58,469
podcast don't be the editor of your

2604
01:37:56,849 --> 01:37:59,969
podcast give that over to someone else

2605
01:37:58,469 --> 01:38:02,519
and let them edit it and if it cost you

2606
01:37:59,969 --> 01:38:03,869
$50 and that's the cost of doing the

2607
01:38:02,519 --> 01:38:05,880
work that you're doing now you might

2608
01:38:03,869 --> 01:38:07,259
make that backup I see my sponsors you

2609
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:11,159
might make that work back by doing a

2610
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:12,929
patron patreon Eitri on this sounds cool

2611
01:38:11,159 --> 01:38:15,058
so you might make that money back by

2612
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:17,579
doing it you know raising funds through

2613
01:38:15,059 --> 01:38:19,199
subscribers on twitch there's all kinds

2614
01:38:17,579 --> 01:38:21,530
of ways to make money through doing

2615
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:23,638
streaming and doing content creation and

2616
01:38:21,530 --> 01:38:26,940
when I took that class a couple weeks

2617
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:29,639
ago I was dumbfounded by the economics

2618
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:31,888
of live streaming and EMPA true patreon

2619
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:33,269
and things like that so that's something

2620
01:38:31,889 --> 01:38:34,739
for you to keep in mind is that if

2621
01:38:33,269 --> 01:38:36,599
people are giving you money then take

2622
01:38:34,739 --> 01:38:38,098
that money and outsource the editing of

2623
01:38:36,599 --> 01:38:40,409
the content that you're creating to

2624
01:38:38,099 --> 01:38:42,959
others and really the reason is because

2625
01:38:40,409 --> 01:38:45,420
the the sound of your voice it's the

2626
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:47,219
sound of your voice when you're trying

2627
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:49,709
to edit yourself you're constantly

2628
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:51,300
critiquing yourself and so you can't

2629
01:38:49,709 --> 01:38:54,479
really get the Edit that you need

2630
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:56,249
because you hear you but if you give it

2631
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,110
over someone else like someone said I

2632
01:38:56,249 --> 01:38:59,340
sound like Ryan Reynolds I don't think I

2633
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:01,469
sound like Ryan Reynolds except when I

2634
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:04,139
watch a Ryan Reynolds movie I'm like no

2635
01:39:01,469 --> 01:39:05,489
I see it but when you hand that over to

2636
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:08,340
someone else they don't have that same

2637
01:39:05,489 --> 01:39:10,320
bias that you have same thing like you

2638
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:12,030
should never edit your own photos you

2639
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:13,679
shouldn't edit you know things like that

2640
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:16,259
because you will find all your flaws and

2641
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:18,449
it won't be perfect outsource

2642
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:21,059
distribution this is that tip from

2643
01:39:18,449 --> 01:39:22,978
earlier xx finish before you go there's

2644
01:39:21,059 --> 01:39:24,599
so many places for you to distribute

2645
01:39:22,979 --> 01:39:26,699
your content I'm pretty sure you can

2646
01:39:24,599 --> 01:39:28,860
find a blog a blog on how to distribute

2647
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:30,869
blogs a webcast and how to distribute

2648
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:32,490
webcast a podcast and how to distribute

2649
01:39:30,869 --> 01:39:33,900
podcast so

2650
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:35,760
if this is something that interests you

2651
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,400
there are so many people have created

2652
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:40,080
content about distribution but what I

2653
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:42,299
wanted here was iTunes it's about

2654
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:44,280
reviews about having a concentrated

2655
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:47,520
amount of reviews in a short period of

2656
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:48,960
time so if at some point if you're doing

2657
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,430
webcast and you decided to take those

2658
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,740
webcast you know the big piece of

2659
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:54,750
content and then break it into podcast

2660
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:56,340
but maybe you ask your discord audience

2661
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:58,800
if this is something that you really

2662
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:00,630
like I'm now putting it on iTunes for

2663
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,670
you to download as a podcast could you

2664
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:04,440
please go and review it so that way we

2665
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:05,610
can show up higher on the rankings and

2666
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:07,110
by showing up higher in the rankings

2667
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:09,660
more people find it more people listen

2668
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:12,000

2670
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,680
easiest in turn to find these days is a

2671

social media intern and it really is

2672
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:21,930

01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:30,059
it's just now when they apply it to

2677

2678

2694
01:41:06,450 --> 01:41:09,809
keeps built in that community and the

2695
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:13,380
thing about emails that's really easy to

2696
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:16,380
share you know if they're we generally

2697
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:18,140
get four hundred new people to our Black

2698
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:20,430
Hills webcast almost every single time

2699
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:22,230
there's an average of four hundred new

2700
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:24,480
people every single webcast that we do

2701
01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:26,610
and those were not people we emailed

2702
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,019
they may have seen on social media or

2703
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:30,120
something like that but for the most

2704
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:32,310
part it was someone that has been to a

2705
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:33,900
webcast before they liked our webcast

2706
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:35,940
and then they forward it to a colleague

2707
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:38,009
and say you need to come to this it was

2708
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:39,839
cool is that my wife works for an

2709
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:42,120
organization that is in information

2710
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:44,820
security and when we send out the Black

2711
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:46,139
Hills email on Mondays she will get that

2712
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:47,699
email not for me

2713
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:49,139
but from a colleague of work that says

2714
01:41:47,699 --> 01:41:51,330
hey this looks like a really good topic

2715
01:41:49,139 --> 01:41:52,830
we should all check it out and then

2716
01:41:51,330 --> 01:41:54,750
she'll come up and she like got another

2717
01:41:52,830 --> 01:41:59,300
email from another colleague says you

2718
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:59,300
got a webcast coming up mm-hmm

2719
01:41:59,449 --> 01:42:06,388
ah it's funny join forces so if you find

2720
01:42:04,679 --> 01:42:09,480
somebody that's currently doing what you

2721
01:42:06,389 --> 01:42:10,980
do or they're in the same sphere as you

2722
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:12,480
and they have a better audience or

2723
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:14,218
balance it better they have a more

2724
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,919
robust or bigger audience so maybe you

2725
01:42:14,219 --> 01:42:19,110
can join forces with em and as your

2726
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:21,060
audience grows they can get some of the

2727
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:22,380
audience over there if you didn't know a

2728
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:24,989
couple years ago they started YouTube

2729
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:26,580
studios the YouTube studios was a place

2730
01:42:24,989 --> 01:42:28,500
in California and Los Angeles is so

2731
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:30,869
exists it's pretty cool and YouTube

2732
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:32,489
studios what YouTube did was they found

2733
01:42:30,869 --> 01:42:33,839
these youtubers that had hundred

2734
01:42:32,489 --> 01:42:36,269
thousand two hundred thousand million

2735
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:39,060
subscribers who would who were in their

2736
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:40,170
house like right now like me and all of

2737
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:41,820
a sudden I have like a hundred thousand

2738
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:43,800
subscribers and YouTube would reach out

2739
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:45,750
to me and say like would you like to

2740
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:49,199
move to California and do this at

2741
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:50,730
YouTube studios so a lot of youtubers

2742
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:53,629
moved from all over the country to

2743
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:57,269
California to Los Angeles and they

2744
01:42:53,630 --> 01:43:00,780
recreated their bedroom at YouTube

2745
01:42:57,270 --> 01:43:02,010
studios so it became a set so it's the

2746
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:03,659
same thing that you would see you know

2747
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:05,610
six months ago but they would recreate

2748
01:43:03,659 --> 01:43:07,080
it at YouTube studios but now they had

2749
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:08,610
professional cameras at professional

2750
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:10,170
lights at professional production

2751
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:11,969
equipment and post-production equipment

2752
01:43:10,170 --> 01:43:13,739
and they were helping them crank out

2753
01:43:11,969 --> 01:43:16,350
their videos and YouTube would keep half

2754
01:43:13,739 --> 01:43:18,718
the revenue and so what was cool about

2755
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:21,510
that is AMA you let's say I'm a youtuber

2756
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:23,550
that has a million subscribers and ten

2757
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:25,560
feet next to me is another youtuber in a

2758
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:27,119
different you know edit suite or

2759
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,590
different this I would get the chance to

2760
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:30,389
meet them and then we would start doing

2761
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:32,330
cross promotional videos where I'm now

2762
01:43:30,389 --> 01:43:34,770
hanging out that youtuber and where our

2763
01:43:32,330 --> 01:43:39,869
subscribers are now we're crossing each

2764
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:41,429
other so that's all of a say if we we

2765
01:43:39,869 --> 01:43:43,380
Black Hills have been looking for

2766
01:43:41,429 --> 01:43:45,150
presenters at while was hacking fest

2767
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:46,350
that have given presentations that we

2768
01:43:45,150 --> 01:43:48,809
think would be good for the Black Hills

2769
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:50,040
audience or for the Wild West hacking

2770
01:43:48,810 --> 01:43:51,869
fest webcast audience that we're gonna

2771
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:53,010
have here in the next couple months and

2772
01:43:51,869 --> 01:43:54,780
so we're gonna reach out to some people

2773
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:55,770
and if we don't reach out to you I'm I'm

2774
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:58,800
sorry it's just we didn't think that

2775
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:59,800
that talk would resonate with that the

2776
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,590
audience yet

2777
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:03,969
or that type of talk or you may need to

2778
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:06,190
improve your speaking skills a little

2779
01:44:03,969 --> 01:44:08,650
bit or your gear so if you're like what

2780
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:09,219
about me so it's just you may not be

2781
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:11,739
ready yet

2782
01:44:09,219 --> 01:44:12,909
because it is thousands of people and we

2783
01:44:11,739 --> 01:44:15,070
want to make sure that you're good to go

2784
01:44:12,909 --> 01:44:16,629
for thousands of people and so we're

2785
01:44:15,070 --> 01:44:17,920
gonna look for other people that want to

2786
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:21,010
work with us and we want to work with

2787
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,139
them to cross-promote that way 14

2788
01:44:21,010 --> 01:44:23,969
minutes to go

2789
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:28,440
marketing

2790
01:44:23,969 --> 01:44:30,989
three I've been living by

2791
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:34,139
Blanchard for like the last 20 years

2792
01:44:30,989 --> 01:44:35,790
have been living by these three steps

2793
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:37,080
from marketing

2794
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:39,570
and the first one is to get people to

2795
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:43,500
know you exist there's no reason to care

2796
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:45,780
animes them once you once they do and it

2797
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:47,880
just comes down to if people don't know

2798
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:51,750
you exist and they can't even make a

2799
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:53,670
decision about you so I will

2800
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:55,230
there's 47 of you right now listen to

2801
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:56,430
this and there's gonna be a recording

2802
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:59,009
later and people listening to the

2803
01:44:56,430 --> 01:45:00,560
recording you listening to this right

2804
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:01,700
now

2805
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:04,510
there's a certain amount of people that

2806
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:06,519
know you exist that's your circle

2807
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:08,410
and you can reach out and get to know

2808
01:45:06,519 --> 01:45:10,060
more people

2809
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:12,550
right now there's a ton of people that

2810
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:14,680
don't know you exist that's fine but

2811
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:15,970
once they know you exist then they can

2812
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:18,010
make a decision if they like you or not

2813
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:19,690
so if they want to hire if they want to

2814
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:22,060
listen to your content they want to you

2815
01:45:19,690 --> 01:45:23,980
know some so until they know you exist

2816
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:26,470
you have to introduce yourself and so

2817
01:45:23,980 --> 01:45:28,410
that might be stuff on social media you

2818
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:31,210
show up to a con you give a presentation

2819
01:45:28,410 --> 01:45:32,860
you come to the discord channel and you

2820
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:34,450
introduce yourself there's an

2821
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:37,929
opportunity for you to introduce

2822
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:40,300
yourself to people now they may not care

2823
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:42,730
I tried to do a comedy in a roomful of a

2824
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:44,830
thousand people most of them did not

2825
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:46,480
care but you have to give them a reason

2826
01:45:44,830 --> 01:45:47,830
to care and so there was a couple people

2827
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:49,419
who were close to the audience that

2828
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:52,330
heard what I said thought it was funny

2829
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:53,800
and they started to care now once they

2830
01:45:52,330 --> 01:45:56,019
started like had they were having the

2831
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:58,300
conversation with Oh Nelson I actually

2832
01:45:56,020 --> 01:46:00,220
this is kind of interesting and then I

2833
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:02,140
got a chance to do some more trips and

2834
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:03,580
by the end of my set there was a good 40

2835
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:06,580
to 50 people in the front that were

2836
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:07,990
laughing and they were engaged they

2837
01:46:06,580 --> 01:46:08,790
didn't know I existed until I got up on

2838
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:11,410
that stage

2839
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:14,769
they didn't care until I started making

2840
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:16,059
them laugh and they didn't really laugh

2841
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:18,100
like I wanted them to

2842
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:19,660
until I got him over that part where I

2843
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:21,400
amazed them because people have an

2844
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:23,710
expectation of you and when you can

2845
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:26,950
exceed that expectation is when you can

2846
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:30,360
amaze somebody not saying to lower it

2847
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:32,280
was expectation so they amaze them

2848
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:33,990
no don't do that gay people know you

2849
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:37,210
exist you're the reason to care and

2850
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:40,469
amaze them once they do all right

2851
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:42,369
audience engagement way better than view

2852
01:46:40,470 --> 01:46:44,239
thank you

2853
01:46:42,369 --> 01:46:46,730
my pair

2854
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:48,199
engagement is way better than views what

2855
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:51,289
I mean by that is if you have a hundred

2856
01:46:48,199 --> 01:46:53,239
people that follow you on twitter but

2857
01:46:51,289 --> 01:46:55,489
only one person ever likes your your

2858
01:46:53,239 --> 01:46:57,888
tweets well then really you only have

2859
01:46:55,489 --> 01:47:00,530
one person the other 99 or most likely

2860
01:46:57,889 --> 01:47:01,610
bots or just people that don't care

2861
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:04,030
about the content that you're putting

2862
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:06,469
out and that's fine once again it's the

2863
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:08,300
subset of the larger audience the people

2864
01:47:06,469 --> 01:47:10,400
that care but once you find those few

2865
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:12,619
but I care then you hope that they

2866
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:15,259
engage and so you're creating stuff I

2867
01:47:12,619 --> 01:47:17,389
heard a you know couple couple years ago

2868
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:18,679
in marketing you know I'm 41 there's

2869
01:47:17,389 --> 01:47:21,889
people coming out there's people younger

2870
01:47:18,679 --> 01:47:23,630
than me is that millennial marketers

2871
01:47:21,889 --> 01:47:25,730
will post something in social media if

2872
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:27,829
no one clicks on it in the first 30

2873
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:28,489
seconds they delete it and then they

2874
01:47:27,829 --> 01:47:30,710
rewrite it

2875
01:47:28,489 --> 01:47:32,900
it changed the image they adjust it they

2876
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:34,369
put it back out again data like that oh

2877
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:37,070
cool

2878
01:47:34,369 --> 01:47:40,159
that is how much Millennials are tuned

2879
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:41,719
in to engagement because they want like

2880
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,919
if I put this out there no one responds

2881
01:47:41,719 --> 01:47:44,959
to it then why am i you putting it out

2882
01:47:42,919 --> 01:47:46,519
there okay what you're looking for is

2883
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:48,769
engagement but let's say you have a

2884
01:47:46,519 --> 01:47:50,059
thousand people who like chair over time

2885
01:47:48,769 --> 01:47:51,289
about what you're doing but only ten of

2886
01:47:50,059 --> 01:47:53,389
them show up when you do a live webcast

2887
01:47:51,289 --> 01:47:56,030
and really what you have is ten people

2888
01:47:53,389 --> 01:47:57,499
and so it's not about caring about the

2889
01:47:56,030 --> 01:48:01,099
overall number it's about the engagement

2890
01:47:57,499 --> 01:48:03,879
number and that would grow as time goes

2891
01:48:01,099 --> 01:48:03,879
on hopefully

2892
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:09,309
eat the other nights audience questions

2893
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:12,309
are gold yes I'm glad I got to this tip

2894
01:48:09,310 --> 01:48:13,960
so I'm doing a webcast right now and I'm

2895
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:16,030
gonna scroll right now through the other

2896
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:17,560
questions and there's a discord channel

2897
01:48:16,030 --> 01:48:19,300
and things like that people have been

2898
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:20,440
sending me questions throughout if you

2899
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:23,230
want to know what to do your next

2900
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:26,099
webcast on it's the audience questions

2901
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:26,099
from your last webcast

2902
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:32,550
so use the audience to help you start

2903
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:35,220
crowdsourcing the content to make next

2904
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:37,380
so if you do a webcast and all the

2905
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:39,720
sudden four or five people ask you a

2906
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:41,400
similar question but maybe you write a

2907
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:42,840
blog post on that and at the end of your

2908
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,580
blog post you leave that back to the

2909
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:46,260
overall webcast you break that webcast

2910
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:48,600
into five different chunks you can now

2911
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:50,490
link those different chunks each of one

2912
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:52,200
of those can be its own blog where you

2913
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:53,730
take the transcript from the the webcast

2914
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:56,790
and you put it actually in the blog

2915
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:58,950
itself you can pay people to write

2916
01:48:56,790 --> 01:49:00,870
transcripts for you or we recently

2917
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:04,380
learned that if you bring up Google Docs

2918
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:05,910
Google Docs and you take a headphone or

2919
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:08,610
so and you stick it next to the

2920
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:11,490
microphone on your computer and you turn

2921
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:15,120
Google like talk to text to talk to text

2922
01:49:11,490 --> 01:49:16,980
on it will give you a transcript of your

2923
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:18,180
video it's not a hundred percent you got

2924
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:20,099
to go in and make some adjustments but

2925
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:22,350
it's pretty damn good and so that can

2926
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:24,060
give you a transcript of the talk that

2927
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:26,330
you gave and then that can revert it

2928
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:28,620
into text and then that text will be SEO

2929
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:30,420
capable and two more people come to your

2930
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:35,640
website and then that will lead them to

2931
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:40,640
your upcoming live webcast so so your

2932
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:43,740
audience questions are the fodder or the

2933
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:47,130
thing that you can do next I wanted to

2934
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:49,320
do a tip before I finished today I want

2935
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:51,420
you all to start liking LinkedIn a lot

2936
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:53,610
more if I if you can take anything away

2937
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:55,920
from today it's to like LinkedIn if you

2938
01:49:53,610 --> 01:50:00,030
want to be a content creator if you are

2939
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:02,580
a usual Twitter user then most likely

2940
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:04,650
you're like LinkedIn really so here's

2941
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:06,330
what happened Twitter became a dumpster

2942
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:08,009
fire so all the people who are like I

2943
01:50:06,330 --> 01:50:10,170
don't like dumpster fires I don't like

2944
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:12,410
all this they went to LinkedIn you

2945
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:15,120
really did they went to LinkedIn and

2946
01:50:12,410 --> 01:50:17,730
that's where they want to get content so

2947
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:21,630
much so I'm gonna show you so Black

2948
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:23,360
Hills had a LinkedIn account for a long

2949
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:25,670
time

2950
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:27,589
and you can see the comings and goings I

2951
01:50:25,670 --> 01:50:29,160
want to show you this range look if you

2952
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:32,640
found me

2953
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:35,460
all right so in March of last year we

2954
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:37,140
averaged about 266 people out our

2955
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:38,880
LinkedIn but we started putting out

2956
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:40,260
content from the content library so

2957
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,490
remember the content library we took all

2958
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:43,410
the old content stuff that was so

2959
01:50:41,490 --> 01:50:46,769
relevant we built out a Content schedule

2960
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:48,420
we had someone help us post that stuff

2961
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:50,190
to social media over say you know use

2962
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:51,960
this number on this day here's the image

2963
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:53,969
here's the text here's all these things

2964
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:55,980
and all of a sudden the engagement just

2965
01:50:53,970 --> 01:50:58,750
went through the roof or adding like

2966
01:50:55,980 --> 01:51:00,730
3,000 people or so a month

2967
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:02,560
and if you go down here you can take a

2968
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:04,070
look at your engagement rate versus

2969
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,960
others

2970
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:08,480
and I'm not saying that I look at this

2971
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:10,100
often just because I'm competitive but

2972
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:12,259
you can see your company versus other

2973
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:13,850
companies and your new followers versus

2974
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:15,860
their some how many updates you have and

2975
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:17,480
what your engagement rate is versus them

2976
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:19,719
and its really nice that active

2977
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:27,230
countermeasures and Black Hills that a

2978
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:28,610
number so by posting content like all

2979
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:31,160
the sudden our numbers start shooting up

2980
01:51:28,610 --> 01:51:33,049
and guess what those people who were now

2981
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:35,660
following the Black Hills website

2982
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:37,430
started coming to our live webcast and

2983
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:38,930
then those people started sharing it

2984
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:40,940
with their friends and then those people

2985
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:43,540
started showing up hey kitty those

2986
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:46,179
people started showing up so LinkedIn is

2987
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:47,290
awesome

2988
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:49,690
one of the really cool features on

2989
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:51,910
LinkedIn that I want to show you is and

2990
01:51:49,690 --> 01:51:54,460
I didn't know this existed so Gary be

2991
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:57,250
put out it like a PowerPoint to us like

2992
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:59,460
290 pages recently and I read all of

2993
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:01,410
them it was great

2994
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:03,210
but there's this feature inside LinkedIn

2995
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:05,530
and I want to show two or all of you

2996
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:08,680

2998
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:13,180

2999
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:17,170
post you can make a picture you can do a

3000
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:18,820
video where you can do in a document so

3001
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:21,300
I'm going to choose this from my desktop

3002
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:21,299
over here

3003
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:26,370
Thank You compromised so if this is your

3004
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:28,920
talk

3005

that you gave and so Jeff is here and

3006
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:36,240
some of the other speakers are here

3007
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:38,520
you can upload your talk think here and

3008
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:40,119
I'm not gonna upload this one I'm just

3009
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:46,030
going to show you

3010
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:47,820
if it turns your talk into 28 piece of

3011
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:49,139
the content

3012
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:51,030
and so now people can go through and

3013
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:55,050
take a look at your talk and then what

3014
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:58,769
you can do is in the way so up here you

3015
01:52:55,050 --> 01:53:00,119
can link to where it is on YouTube so if

3016
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:01,710
there's a link for it on YouTube you can

3017
01:53:00,119 --> 01:53:03,780
post it here you can see here's to talk

3018
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:05,790
here it is if you want to download the

3019
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:07,800
slides you can go to my website and on

3020
01:53:05,790 --> 01:53:09,989
my website you can download the slides

3021
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:12,270
if you want the PowerPoint version but

3022
01:53:09,989 --> 01:53:14,269
you can start using this the engagement

3023
01:53:12,270 --> 01:53:15,420
rates for these right here are

3024
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:17,550
ridiculous

3025
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:19,560
if my normal post has an engagement rate

3026
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:21,690
I was like five percent these have an

3027
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:24,540
engagement rate of like 46 to 56 percent

3028
01:53:21,690 --> 01:53:26,428
and what happens is in LinkedIn's world

3029
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:28,380
the algorithm sees all the people

3030
01:53:26,429 --> 01:53:29,790
looking through the slides and converts

3031
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:31,260
that to like well your engagement rates

3032
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:32,699
massively high so let's show this to a

3033
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:34,650
large audience and so it keeps showing

3034
01:53:32,699 --> 01:53:36,449
it to a larger audience and so some of

3035
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:38,790
the ways that we built up our LinkedIn

3036
01:53:36,449 --> 01:53:43,400
or the last couple months because by

3037
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:43,400
sharing the slides or the presentations

3038
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:49,580
all right in conclusion we're at the in

3039
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:53,180
conclusion slide

3040
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:54,830
in conclusion thank you thank you for

3041
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:56,780
being here you know you do a workshop

3042
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:58,309
and you ask people to show up and you

3043
01:53:56,780 --> 01:54:01,250
say this is what it's about

3044
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:05,300
and you showed up and I appreciate that

3045
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:08,210
and so in conclusion I've tried to live

3046
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:10,070
by this never deny teaching someone the

3047
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:12,230
knowledge that I have in my head I love

3048
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:14,330
being a teacher that's one of the things

3049
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:15,769
I love most with being a teacher for 19

3050
01:54:14,330 --> 01:54:17,690
years but I realized that I wasn't

3051
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:19,160
growing as a person anymore because I

3052
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:21,589
was teaching the same topic so I was

3053
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:24,170
covering the same materials and so what

3054
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:25,730
I decided to do was quit my job and sell

3055
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:27,980
my comic book store because I wasn't

3056
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:30,349
growing and just do something different

3057
01:54:27,980 --> 01:54:32,419
and I've learned a ton of stuff over the

3058
01:54:30,350 --> 01:54:34,160
last nine years that I've been doing

3059
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:37,250
things different so I'm looking at

3060
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:41,120
teaching again but now it's with 18

3061
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:43,010
years of knowledge and so I am excited

3062
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:44,420
about teaching again I am excited that I

3063
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:47,120
got a chance to teach you here today so

3064
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:48,470
thank you for listening I hope that the

3065
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:50,330
one thing that you take away from this

3066
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:52,130
is that you have knowledge in your brain

3067
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:54,019
and then you have the opportunity to

3068
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:55,370
share with others and it may be virtual

3069
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:58,960
because the world that we're living in

3070
01:54:55,370 --> 01:55:03,470
right now might be a little the word

3071
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:05,360
isolated little distancing and so we're

3072
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:07,550
gonna need each other more than than

3073
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:09,309
ever and connect in ways and share our

3074
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:12,920
knowledge and ways and it might be

3075
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:14,420
virtual and streaming the recap develop

3076
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:17,630
your voice it's gonna take some time to

3077
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:19,040
develop your voice but as you develop

3078
01:55:17,630 --> 01:55:21,740
your voice you also have to get used to

3079
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:23,210
hearing your voice and so as you develop

3080
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:24,230
your voice it's gonna take time it's

3081
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:26,000
gonna take a little while to get over

3082
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:27,440
that imposter syndrome and over the

3083
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,720
sound your own voice to make something

3084
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:31,280
content chunking and I make something

3085
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:32,660
big and break it down into the

3086
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:35,030
individual pieces so that way I don't

3087
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:36,860
have to make a thing and just keep

3088
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:38,450
making more things and keep making more

3089
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:40,700
things can I take a big piece of thing

3090
01:55:38,450 --> 01:55:42,380
turn it into smaller pieces that way I

3091
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:44,540
don't have to keep doing research I can

3092
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:46,400
do this research once and turn it into

3093
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:47,530
all these and then go research something

3094
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:50,469
else

3095
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:51,910
career advancement if you do any of the

3096
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:53,950

3100
01:55:56,710 --> 01:56:01,180

3101
