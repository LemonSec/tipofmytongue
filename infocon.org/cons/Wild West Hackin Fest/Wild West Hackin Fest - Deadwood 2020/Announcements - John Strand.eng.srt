18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,170
channel and the discord channel is

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,949
pretty cool let me show you real quick

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,870

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,239
different lobbies that exists so right

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,060
now Lobby con is the equivalent of

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,649
exactly that it's just Lobby con where

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,750
people are showing all kinds of really

27
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:11,750
really fancy gifts and things like that

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,350
this is actually pretty cool because

29
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,030
this gives us a lot more this gives us a

30
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,970
lot more interaction and it's not just

31
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,649
interaction with you know us and you but

32
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,679
it's also interaction with each other

33
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:27,810
so please do me a favor and jump on the

34
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:30,690
discord channel because it's going to

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,119
work now Lobby con is just for all kinds

36
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,408
of just garbage where people are just

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,770
sharing all kinds of different tools

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,799
techniques means with each other with

39
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,630
the track talks if you go into the track

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,090
talks the track talks are where you can

41
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,539
discuss the track that's happening right

42
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,330
now

43
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,470
so at Wild West hiking fest we have

44
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,020
track 1 talks

45
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,080
track 2 talks and we also have the track

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,949
workshops the workshops are kind of like

47
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,989
a compressed training so that's once

48
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,080
again a place oh my god that is a

49
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:05,580
frightening picture but the track talks

50
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,830
are where you can interact with the

51
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,199
speaker while they're presenting I can't

52
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,109
vouch for every single presenter

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,379
actually going into the track talks on

54
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,690
disscourn but I know that I liked it

55
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,700
quite a bit and it's also a way for you

56
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,470
guys to kind of talk with us and each

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,319
other about the talks and I've been

58
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,790
noticing already that in jobs talk and

59
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,730
in my talk there was a ton of people

60
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,489
that were contributing to the talk while

61
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,988
it was happening and like all kinds of

62
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,319
different cool things that they were

63
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:40,290
coming up with and I like that it's it's

64
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,899
really really really just cool to do

65
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,620
that now as with everything try to be

66
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,780
nice okay everybody if you go into the

67
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,700
the discord channel in your jerk we're

68
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,950
gonna we're going to bounce you and I

69
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,670
want to explain a little bit about what

70
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,530
being a jerk actually entails if you

71
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,459
disagree with somebody technically I

72
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,380
think you state your

73
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,750
point but if it devolves into personal

74
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,850
attacks against those people we will

75
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,440
boot you even if I agree with you like

76
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,799
technically if you're correct it doesn't

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,210
give you the authorization at all to

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,480
just be a jackass

79
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,340
okay so be nice all right the other

80
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,810
thing that I would ask you to do as

81
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,430
you're going through and working with

82
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,500
discord is try to understand the opinion

83
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,360
of the person you disagree with that

84
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,670
doesn't mean you have to disagree with

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,310
them it just means that you should try

86
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,429
to at least understand where they're

87
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,370
coming from and many times what I do if

88
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,790
I'm online if somebody disagrees with me

89
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,870
I try to go forward and say what you're

90
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:50,100
saying is X Y & Z and then come back and

91
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,560
say that silent Ryan no clown memes are

92
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,560
not permissible no snow it's no cloud

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,090
means please I just shot myself live on

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,430
the string didn't I cuz now it's gonna

95
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:04,200
be nothing but clone memes so with that

96
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,580
with that it might have completely lost

97
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,149
my train of thought no I'm terrified

98
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,130
about clown means but be nice to people

99
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,590
try to understand their argument

100
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,970
don't try to immediately prove them

101
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,920
wrong as soon as you get into an

102
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,110
argument as soon as you argue with

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,360
people that's the best way to lose an

104
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,550
argument what else do we have in the

105
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,200
code of conduct it's been pinned to the

106
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,510
announcement channel so it's important

107
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,310
please review that don't be a jerk we

108
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,289
are working on swag conference t-shirts

109
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,750
and we'll be sending out a link asking

110
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,850
for your mailing address here in the

111
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,840
next couple of days bear with us if I

112
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:41,850
think I can let me see I think I can

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,919
unmute myself in discord I don't know if

114
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,920
I can turn on my camera in discord

115
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,150
apparently not okay well maybe that

116
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:56,479
didn't work saying I should turn on

117
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,580
two-factor authentication so all right

118
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,810
that same splice yeah that probably

119
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,460
sounds like a good idea because we've

120
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,199
had time for all of that that's five

121
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,628
days we've got time for security we'll

122
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,830
do it live but so please be willing to

123
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,729
give us your address to get you swag

124
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,460

125
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:15,349
the schedule of the event along with the

126
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,719

also it's on the pin announcement

129
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,310
channel the discord survey we also want

130
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,919
to take a couple of seconds and thank

131
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,870
our sponsors we have open security I

132
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,849
keep calling them open site because

133
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,460
that's how I have been referring to them

134
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:37,009
for forever is just open sack but open

135
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,318
security there are platinum sponsor we

136
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:41,840
got plex track red canary and McCarty

137
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,150
core for gold and our silver sponsors

138
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,948
are 40 more secure ideas and Guardians

139
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:50,929
Milton side our site a quick note on our

140
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,000
sponsors I have this handy dandy slide

141
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,389
one of the things I'd like to get across

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,310
is by and large that our sponsors are

143
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,289
people that have been some of our best

144
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,599
friends at Black Hills information

145
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,919
security and as I mentioned a lot of

146
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:07,520
these companies I would genuinely

147
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,580
consider to be competitors but that's

148
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,529
okay in security you really shouldn't be

149
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,560
using the exact same pen testing team

150
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:17,479
every single year so you should rotate

151
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,539
around and check out companies like open

152
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:24,620
security is a great company to do stuff

153
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:25,880
with as well so in guardians is actually

154
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,740
in here and I want to talk a little bit

155
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,710
about in guardians guardians is probably

156
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,120
the grandfather security company to lock

157
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,590
hills information security and a wide

158
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,719
number of additional security companies

159
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,250
including secure ideas and yeah now

160
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:42,740
Kevin I'll get to you here in a second

161
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,169
but um they are really kind of the

162
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,599
foundation for what we decided to be at

163
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:50,150
Black Hills information security and it

164
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,529
was always amazing to have a big brother

165
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,770
and sister organization that you're

166
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:57,229

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,948
sure that I did everything I was

195
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:07,429
supposed to do I think we did it all

196
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:11,089
right we did it we did it we did it yeah

197
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:12,078
all right so give us a few minutes and

198
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:14,449
we're gonna get started we're gonna get

199
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,959
Mike pour in I'm gonna go get some

200
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,529
coffee

201
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:21,559
because I desperately need coffee also

202
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:24,189
you should note that the webcam feature

203
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:26,509
seems to be shut off with GoToWebinar

204
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:29,800
this could be an indication that maybe

205
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:31,669
GoToWebinar has some issues so far the

206
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,799
connections and everything seem to be

207
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,929
just fine but I could definitely see

208
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,059
GoToWebinar to say bandwidth cutting off

209
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,708
the camera feeds from some of their

210
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,649
webinars and things of that nature so

211
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:44,989
I'm having the problem Jason's having

212
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,939
the problem we'll see if mike has the

213
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,709
problem but if there's no video coming

214
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:51,410
live for from the people that are

215
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:54,199
presenting that's okay big thing is the

216
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:58,519
content as usual all the content will be

217
00:08:54,199 --> 00:09:01,099
recorded and it will be put up on the

218
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,889
internet on YouTube so if you miss a

219
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,360
talk it's not that big of a deal you can

220
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:07,639
always catch it later the one thing I

221
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,850
would request is if you missed a talk

222
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,610
and it's not up within the next 15

223
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,320
minutes please be patient there is

224
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:19,370
a ton of there is an absolute ton of

225
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,440
work that has to be done in cutting

226
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,170
these and turning them into videos that

227
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,910
are discrete section like videos of this

228
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,769
talk versus this talk which is this talk

229
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,510
so show my screen looks like somebody

230
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:33,170
dropped me as the presenter and then put

231
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:37,910
me back seems like a with me okay oh I

232
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:39,649
was gonna blame Larry but I see that

233
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:45,410
Larry's on whether he can unmute

234
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:47,390
yourself how you doing sir maybe I can

235
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,860
unmute him and then we can just listen

236
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:55,189
to Larry look what's going on in Larry's

237
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,880
office I'm good I couldn't myself oh we

238
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,890
got you covered

239
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,160
we got you covered how you doing sir I'm

240
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:04,370
doing well I'm doing well also make sure

241
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,680
I cam is enable here too I don't know if

242
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,279
the webcam stuff is working right now it

243
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,689
does not seem to be yeah it's across the

244
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,970
entire platform we think that

245
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,540
GoToWebinar is getting slammed with

246
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,910
people working from working from home I

247
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,170
was hoping I could show everyone kind of

248
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:25,910
the office and what we're working on

249
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:29,269
here today but looks like the webcam is

250
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,319
cam is not going to allow that yeah it

251
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:32,390
was interesting when we did the test

252
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:37,040
call in the green room earlier it was it

253
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:39,800
was fine oh yeah I I think but that's a

254
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,890
different webinar platinum

255
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,109
isn't that go to meeting Jason no we're

256
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,350
using GoToWebinar we need to check on

257
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,640
this license and we might have to kill

258
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,250
those one and start it again

259
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:58,850
so we'll see now if we have to do that

260
00:10:52,250 --> 00:11:00,769
later on so Jason are you by yourself at

261
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,110
the house or are you guys kind of

262
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:05,839
working together at the office or is Deb

263
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,790
over ear place helping out Deb is here

264
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,350
we have a command center of all the

265
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,050
different streams we have a green room

266
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,380
going with all the I can't show you but

267
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,689
it's a my entire kitchen table is just

268
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,089
covered in computers and camera and

269
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,800
video and sound equipment so it's gonna

270
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:22,880
be the same thing here we should

271
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,160
probably take a couple of minutes and

272
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,449
talk about the people that are in the

273
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,899
background that are making this happen I

274
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:28,939
mean

275
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,860
although Jason and myself were on all

276
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,930
the webcast for Black Hills information

277
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,639
security so you want to talk a little

278
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,719
bit about what's Deb is doing in the

279
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,819
background and how she's helping out

280
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,290
yeah so for all the people who are

281
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:41,660
interested in how virtual Khan works

282
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,610
essentially you have to check with all

283
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,509
the speakers to make sure that they have

284
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,649
working sound and video equipment and

285
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:51,019
what we've learned over the years is not

286
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,869
everyone does and so if you don't have

287
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:55,129
good audio and it's not good you're

288
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:56,720
gonna have bad video you can have bad

289
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:59,809
slides but you can't have bad audio

290
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,459
people don't like that audio so for the

291
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:03,829
last couple days we were testing all the

292
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:06,290
audio and that's Deb and anyone that did

293
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:09,138
have bad audio we Amazon them drop

294
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,259
shipped new microphones to speakers and

295
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:14,360
presenters and trainers and what she is

296
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:18,679
currently talking to whoever's gonna be

297
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:21,259
the next speaker after Mike and after

298
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,629
Mike and Larry to get them ready it goes

299
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,040
to that it's a seamless transition so we

300
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:27,350
have 13 minutes until Mike and Larry

301
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,759
start and then after that is non-stop

302
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,950
all day with two tracks and then the

303
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:35,080
works out start that's what that's doing

304
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:38,260
and then here in the office in Spearfish

305
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,840
South Dakota the team that's helping

306
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,860
pull all of this together and we have D

307
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,360

330
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,630
conference can't remember who else we

331
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,280
have floating around but there's a lot

332
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:40,180
of bhi asked people that took this week

333
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,439
off to just support this initiative and

334
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,140
make it work on a ground based

335
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,270
perspective and it just it was nice to

336
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,689
have them set up so that they can work

337
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,810
remotely from home to be able to get

338
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,110
these things kicked off as well

339
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,579
so that's kind of the background team I

340
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,200
would say that Jason and I aren't doing

341
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,330
anything but I know that that's not true

342
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,370
for Jason's perspective at all

343
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,050
Jason's been really really really busy

344
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,840
of course he has to be busy because he

345
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,520
went on a cruise last week Jason did you

346
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,700
find out that we decided to cancel the

347
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,680
ground-based and go like virtual like

348
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,900
while you were on the cruise ship that

349
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,900
is the fact Jon I was on a cruise ship

350
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:22,589
and you had done a webcast that was

351
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,630
unscheduled and then after that I said

352
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,730
Deb how was the webcast and she said it

353
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,520
was great Jon said that we canceled

354
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:32,010
wild-west I confessed work on virtual

355
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,760
and I started to dry-heave all on that

356
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,250
cruise ship

357
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,800
not from the coronavirus that yeah now

358
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:43,580
but that was that's when I learned about

359
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:46,250
it and then yeah I got Internet at sea I

360
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,070
did I got the Internet at speed if you

361
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,430
start coordinating some of this last

362
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,980
Friday

363
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,650
isn't that just HughesNet I mean it's

364
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,960
satellite isn't it like super leggy like

365
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,970
like really slow like you click a link

366
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,100
and it would take like a second or two

367
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,420
to pick it up oh it was absolutely

368
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,980
terrible I was afraid to open up my

369
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,050
email just in case someone had sent me

370
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,190
like attachments because I thought it

371
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,949
was gonna take forever just to get my

372
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,560
email yeah yeah probably it's probably a

373
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,630
good call like that but yeah we made

374
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,280
that call and there was a lot of

375
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,300
conversation about taking this thing

376
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,770
virtual when I talked about it last

377
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,000
night a little bit but there was a lot

378
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:25,030
of conversation about taking the whole

379
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,370
thing virtual and as we've gone further

380
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:31,400
down the rabbit hole I do not regret at

381
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:34,790
all that decision to take this

382
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,340
conference virtual I think the Governor

383
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,939
of California today basically told

384
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,930
people not to do any large gatherings

385
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,820
canceled events I think it was over a

386
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,130
thousand people even it may be less than

387
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,300
that and there's lots of conversations

388
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,830
here in South Dakota about whether or

389
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,560
not schools going to happen next week so

390
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:54,820
lots of weird things going on damn it

391
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,819
the clowns I hate you

392
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:02,110
off you're fired that's a weekly

393
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:02,110
occurrence

394
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,020
yeah it's a weekly occurrence with the

395
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,130
clowns I did have somebody that said

396
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,500
that they wanted to be Mike poor when

397
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,480
they grow up

398
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,660
I see it's gotough says I don't ever

399
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,520
want to grow up

400
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,949
so a fun story about ed SCOTUS of mike

401
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,189
pork I've told this story before at

402
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:21,280
different things but

403
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:24,520
Mike for and Edie go back a really

404
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,449
really long time and I kind of came in

405
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,530
the middle of that conversation and I

406
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,620
could part of that relationship rather

407
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,600
and I was teaching a at San Diego that's

408
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,920
gotas I was a teacher's assistant for

409
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,380
ADD and I can't remember what year this

410
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,630
was

411
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,430
and it was it was actually the year that

412
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:44,970
Ed SCOTUS got me drunk and then gave him

413
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:47,520
Indian Guardians oh yeah 1492 I thought

414
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,530
it was January 1st 1601 and but Ed got

415
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,510
me drunk and gave me the Guardians

416
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,939
interview yeah it was like he was just

417
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:57,180
buying you know alcohol and then finally

418
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:00,120
whenever I'm good and inebriated on like

419
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,170
this amazing beer that he had I like

420
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,500
what would you like to take the in

421
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:07,170
guardians interview like a good yeah

422
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,790
well that next night he said I got to

423
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,480
meet Mike for you and Mike for gonna get

424
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,030
along great

425
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,490
you guys gotta get together so I went

426
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,440
out to eat with Mike at this Indian

427
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,839
restaurant and I found out that Mike has

428
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,700
this intense hatred for cilantro which I

429
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,459
actually hate cilantro too it was a

430
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,230
weird dinner it was kind of like Mike

431
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,780
and I started kind of going at it

432
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,430
technically with each other and Mike was

433
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,930
talking about packets and then I was

434
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,790
talking about packets cuz I was working

435
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,940
on some some stuff for like kernel level

436
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,620
drivers for packet analysis and we were

437
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,970
going back and forth it might kick my

438
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,610
ass I want to make it very very very

439
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,590
clear Mike's knowledge of tcp/ip and

440
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,689
networking just absolutely floored me

441
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,159
but I was young and stupid and probably

442
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,510
drunk at that as well so I decided I

443
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,790
would start crossing swords with Mike

444
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,260
for the next night and I are hanging out

445
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,480
and he's like so what did you think of

446
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,980
Mike war look I gotta be honest I think

447
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,160
my four is kind of an asshole

448
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,500
ed goes you know what like what my poor

449
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,570
said the exact same thing about you and

450
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,970
you guys are gonna be like best friends

451
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:11,189
and sure as hell absolutely turned out

452
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,760
you know Mike is absolutely like a big

453
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,500
brother to me

454
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,940
same with Ed SCOTUS I would not have

455
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,620
made it at the SANS Institute without

456
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,960
those two I'd have taken me under the

457
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,540
wing and kicking a living hell out of me

458
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,100

459
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,260

466

00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,999
what was the best question you were ever

493
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:34,859
asked as an instructor why I couldn't

494
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:38,909
get Steven Northcutt to wear closed toed

495
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:41,728
shoes really that was that was the best

496
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:43,769
question that was probably one of the

497
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:45,809
most bizarre questions I got asked that

498
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:47,879
I had absolutely nothing to do with but

499
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,769
I think the best question that I was

500
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:53,299
ever asked as an instructor was we were

501
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:55,830
discussing the behavior that SSH

502
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:57,869
suppresses the urgent flag in TCP

503
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,549
communications if you do like a

504
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:02,158
control-c or an interrupt character

505
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:04,320
within a terminal session typically over

506
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,599
TCP you have an urgent flag that gets

507
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,189
posted so that particular interrupts

508
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:11,428
character gets processed faster up the

509
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:14,249
stack SSH suppresses the urgent flag the

510
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:17,820
immediate follow-on question - you know

511
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:19,710
whether it suppress it or not was why it

512
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,200
would do this right now the theory is

513
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,929
that because the stage is over TCP it

514
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,659
does not encrypt the TCP header if you

515
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:29,159
knew for example that a packet with an

516
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,200
urgent flag with an urgent pointer

517
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,599
pointing at the data inside that packet

518
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,489
that was encrypted contains a control

519
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,739
see for example or interrupt character

520
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:39,929
you could essentially do a crypt

521
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:41,879
analysis attack and try to reverse the

522
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:44,039
key interesting for me you know in that

523
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:45,658
I wasn't thinking that far ahead when

524
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,690
you know they ask about the urgent flag

525
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:50,399
and then immediately follow me SSH

526
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,869
suppress Deardon flag or not you know

527
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,820
immediately had a fire up an SSH session

528
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:55,949
to a terminal semi interrupted character

529
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,080
and see the best H actually suppresses

530
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,329
the urgent flag in the TCP stack

531
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,769
fantastic very very cool I've got two

532
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:04,230
minutes I'm gonna take the next one on

533
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,610
Mike the best question I ever

534
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,559
sot sans and this is one that you

535
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,750
remember we were teaching hat i think it

536
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,120
was either sans fire sans CDI at the

537
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,830
hilton on Connecticut Street and we were

538
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,000
supposed to go out to eat and we had a

539
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,470
whole bunch of friends that were in town

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,380
it might have been one of the honey pig

541
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:22,350
nights and Mike was late and I went down

542
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,850
to Mike's room and he's sitting there

543
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,928
with a camera or who the other

544
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,610
instructor was there was another

545
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,650
instructor that was down there and then

546
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,649
there was these three ladies that were

547
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,809
just peppering Mike and the other

548
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,700
instructor with questions and what had

549
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:39,270
happened is Mike said I'm gonna stay

550
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,380
here as long as you need like if you

551
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,940
guys have any questions because these

552
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,160
these ladies that basically were in the

553
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,780
room they were basically forced into

554
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,160
security it was a job change for them

555
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,460
and it was kind of a sink or swim

556
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,500
scenario and they were basically just

557
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,990
pinging Mike with as many questions as

558
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,150
they possibly could and they wouldn't

559
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:00,390
let Mike leave and Mike was kind of

560
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,679
tired so I went in and tag-teamed and I

561
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,390
took some questions and then the other

562
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,880
instructor his name I can't I just can't

563
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,100
remember who was the other instructor we

564
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,059
were rotating around and these ladies

565
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,260
wouldn't let us leave I think I was

566
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,879
there for another hour we didn't get out

567
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,340
of that room until 7:30 but it was

568
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,650
really really soon for basic questions

569
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,059
some really deep questions but the thing

570
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,640
that I thought was so cool is they had a

571
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,960
firm desire to learn the topic and Mike

572
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,669
was willing to stay in that room to make

573
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,320
sure that they got the topic and then we

574
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:27,030
all got pulled into it it was just a

575
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,500
really cool experience found out years

576
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,970
later Mike can tell you exactly when one

577
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,559
of them works but we found out that one

578
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,630
of them actually ended up running an

579
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:36,928
entire security operation center which

580
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:39,980
was just a really cool thing to find out

581
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:39,980
that that stuff pays off
