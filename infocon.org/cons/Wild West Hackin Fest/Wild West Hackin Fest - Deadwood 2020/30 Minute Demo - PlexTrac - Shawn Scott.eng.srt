00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,680
i'll be uh keep an eye on the discord

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,040
channel john mentioned in flextrap we're

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,280
all about getting the work done

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,959
you know we started this organization

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,639
with uh with our founder dana claus

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
great appsec pen tester

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,400
loves doing the work like all of us hate

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,520
doing the report writing

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,359
myself my background air force cyber

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,198
warfare officer finished up in a

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,680
defensive cpt mainly on the blue team

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,039
side

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,720
got into the spleen section started

16
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,160
write reports and i also hated it became

17
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,479
a flextrax customer

18
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,399
and here i am today flextrac has evolved

19
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,239
we do a lot but we're really focused on

20
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,480
on just facilitating the workflow

21
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,279
getting everything going and and making

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,000
sure that we

23
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,440
we're all saving time so i'm gonna kind

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,079
of compress what we would normally do in

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,760
about an hour

26
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,760
into 20 minutes save some time for

27
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,280
questions but just as a reminder you can

28
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,199
always come visit us we are still

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,600
in the safe zone as you can see here

30
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,680
plex track the nice little island of

31
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
idaho in montana we are currently

32
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,359
infection free if you are not please

33
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
don't come just set up a zoom chat with

34
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,000
us

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
so when we uh we hop into the platform

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
here what we're presented with on the

37
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,119
splash page

38
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,880
is what i had currently have access to

39
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,920
so we have role-based access control

40
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,039
which allows us

41
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,040
to ensure that we can not only

42
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
divide the work between members of our

43
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,200
team but also ensure

44
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,520
that we can give access to the platform

45
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,240
to the end client the consumer of the

46
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,560
data

47
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,399
and so as you can see i've got access as

48
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,080
an admin here to a ton of reports

49
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
a ton of findings and then we have this

50
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,280
concept of the wider database

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
i'm sure every one of us that writes

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
reports has got some sort of place

53
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,720
whether that's an excel

54
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,400
sheet a repository anything like that

55
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,158
where we copy and paste things from

56
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
we try to eliminate that copy paste by

57
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,960
bringing it into the platform

58
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
i'm going to assume that most of the

59
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,880
audience here is interested primarily in

60
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,079
the report writing aspect and how we

61
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,759
facilitate that

62
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,759
and share that with the blue team

63
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,600
members so i'm going to start off

64
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,360
just by hopping right into how we

65
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,520
actually build out reports

66
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,360
and prepare them so we organize

67
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,759
everything in the context of clients

68
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,560
clients can be actual customers that you

69
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,320
interact with

70
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
or they can be divisions inside of a

71
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,000
business unit we've got about a 60 40

72
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,800
split 60 percent of our

73
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
customers tend to be consultancies some

74
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,680
of them are on the line now and i

75
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,560
appreciate you guys providing the mutual

76
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
support here

77
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
but then also internal red teams the

78
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,519
folks that are actually hired and doing

79
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,680
the job and

80
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,520
then sharing that stuff internally so

81
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
inside the context of a client

82
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,720
we've got a number of reports and i'm

83
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
just going to hop into one of these

84
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,840
we've got some high level analytics

85
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,000
as well so when i hop into a report

86
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
i'm provided a list of all the findings

87
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,959
that i've generated and i'm going to

88
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,879
show you kind of how things look at

89
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,640
look when they're fully baked out when

90
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,319
the sausage is all the way made

91
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
and then we'll kind of step back in time

92
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,319
and walk through the process

93
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,679
of how i've getting getting data if i

94
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,160
hop into the context of

95
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,040
any one of these findings here you see

96
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,079
that we've got the

97
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,000
all the data here that you would

98
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,599
normally include in any of your normal

99
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,959
findings your description

100
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,799
one thing that's really cool about a

101
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,480
web-based platform is that

102
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
you know if a screen sh if a picture's

103
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,920
worth a thousand words

104
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,599
we say that a screenshot is is worth a

105
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,879
thousand or a picture

106
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,359
sorry video is worth a thousand

107
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,879
screenshots but really helpful if you're

108
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
trying to demonstrate

109
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,480
how you arrived at an exploit the steps

110
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,800
you took instead of having to

111
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,879
make a started out as a 300 page report

112
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,560
even even longer

113
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
we also have the ability of obviously

114
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
dropping any other evidence you're

115
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
looking for

116
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,319
into the platform we take care of all

117
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,238
the formatting for you to include

118
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,599
things like auto numbering your your

119
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,360
captions and things like that

120
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,720
you know code samples as well and

121
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,879
affected assets

122
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,480
and if you if you're bringing in some

123
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,840
the data from a scanning tool things

124
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,079
like that we even tuck in the

125
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
the raw data here recommendations

126
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
references

127
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
and this is all the canned decant fields

128
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,560
the things that you know

129
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
most people are going to report on in

130
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,920
any given finding

131
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,920
but you can add and customize how you're

132
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
reporting on any particular finding

133
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,439
and each one of these is editable and so

134
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,319
all the things that we we just took a

135
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,040
look at here

136
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,560
are in the finding details you've got

137
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
your standard title severity

138
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,480
most of the stuff isn't required but we

139
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,400
have this concept of assigning

140
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,238
these things to a user and we'll talk a

141
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
little bit about that in a moment but

142
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,120
you know we kind of build ourselves as

143
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,720
the purple team platform as a way that

144
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,480
the blue and the red can come together

145
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,000
and once the handoff is made this really

146
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,560
allows the blue team to start

147
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,079
actually using flex track as a workflow

148
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,320
product

149
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
so in our description here you can do

150
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,520
inline

151
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,039
screenshots other images things like

152
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
that markdown

153
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,560
anything you like but then what's really

154
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,800
cool is

155
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,280
the the tagging feature and the tagging

156
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,560
feature provides a whole lot of power

157
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,840
for you to really drill down after the

158
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,320
report has been generated if your

159
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,960
clients

160
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,919
really drill down take a look at

161
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,000
findings that

162
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,840
that are specific to an area of concern

163
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,479
we have people using these for the miter

164
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,799
the miter

165
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,159
framework as well tagging them both by

166
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,840
the tactic and the technique

167
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,600
and that allows them to sort that data

168
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
to drill down into it later

169
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
but if what you want to report upon

170
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,360
isn't one of these standard fields

171
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
we also have the concept of the custom

172
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,039
field and this really you can collect

173
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,919
any bit of data you want

174
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,080
so truly you know anything you want you

175
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,000
can collect evidence here as well

176
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,000
all of this then becomes referenceable

177
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
stuff and you can even template this out

178
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
so that you're not

179
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,560
attempting to have to recreate these

180
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
fields

181
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
each time you create a finding our

182
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,840
affected assets

183
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,039
this is where i can manually input an

184
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,198
asset that was the

185
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,719
the subject of the particular finding or

186
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,320
as i show you later on when we bring

187
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,919
things in from scanning tools this will

188
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440
auto populate for me

189
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,719
and tuck things away in the evidence and

190
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,000
i can have as many of these affected

191
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
assets as i want

192
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,280
and what's nice is as i add assets to a

193
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,479
finding

194
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,919
they're not just collected in the

195
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,520
context of the report but we start

196
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,159
building up a database at the client

197
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,799
level

198
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,000
so that the client is has the ability to

199
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,080
to pick an asset

200
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,280
and view all of the findings across all

201
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,479
the reports

202
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,479
got the ability to drop those

203
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,080
screenshots and videos in here you can

204
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,840
put as many of those as you like

205
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,440
you don't have to worry about formatting

206
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,359
and sizing those things

207
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,880
that's all taken care of for you same

208
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,840
thing with code samples

209
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,960
so the structure for how data is input

210
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,280
for a finding

211
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,359
is really built to give you a way to

212
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,359
come in put all the standard stuff in

213
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,960
but then add as little or as much data

214
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
as you want so that it can match your

215
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,840
reporting platform

216
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,160
we're always trying to straddle the line

217
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,159
there between how do we make flex track

218
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
and intuitive product use and how do we

219
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,639
also provide flexibility

220
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,080
for our clients to to do the things that

221
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,600
they want to do

222
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
i mentioned the fact that we have these

223
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
uh these status trackers

224
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,719
so once you've handed off a finding to

225
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,318
your blue team

226
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
they can come in here and they can begin

227
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,199
to document the actual work of

228
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,199
remediation

229
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,960
so now you know i take myself from the

230
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,280
point of a tester and now i'm

231
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,359
i'm on the receiving side of this you

232
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,400
know i can assign this to john doe

233
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,840
and john doe is like hey i got this and

234
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,840
now we start getting this running

235
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,000
narrative of all of

236
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
the the actions that have been taken on

237
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,360
this particular finding

238
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,599
and what's nice also and i don't have

239
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,520
this demo instance linked here

240
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,960
but we have direct integrations at the

241
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,680
api level with both

242
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,039
jira and servicenow so that if you've

243
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,639
already got a ticketing system and you

244
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,318
don't want to use the built-in method

245
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,720
for tracking your remediation

246
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,400
you got that two-way sync going on so

247
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,120
that the tickets continue to be

248
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,440
handed out so that is the big picture of

249
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,240
what

250
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,400
findings look like fully baked out and a

251
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,919
very high level overview of how you

252
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,318
actually put them into

253
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,520
into the structure of a finding but i

254
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,000
kind of want to walk you through how do

255
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,159
we actually

256
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
get this data how do we get from from a

257
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,479
blank canvas

258
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,840
to all of this this information so i'm

259
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,880
going to start off by creating a

260
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,119
a new find or new report actually and so

261
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,840
it's

262
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,120
it's really quite simple not a lot

263
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,919
that's required to get you going you can

264
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,160
always come back

265
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,840
and add more of this information later

266
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,680
but we do allow you to collect a lot of

267
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,679
metadata at the report level

268
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
to include you know fun things like when

269
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
you started and ended this and the idea

270
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,400
is that

271
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,000
get all this metadata in to include

272
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,239
potentially who we're signing

273
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,759
as far as the operators can even tag

274
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,840
things at the report level

275
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,280
you know perhaps this was an annual pci

276
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,919
test and

277
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,599
there we go pci angle pen test which i

278
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,120
got twice nice thing about the tags is

279
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,639
once you create them once

280
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,560
you've only got to type in a few

281
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,000
characters and you're off to the races

282
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,240
it'll autofill for you

283
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,039
so now i've got this blank shell of a

284
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,520
report

285
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,318
that has absolutely no findings in it so

286
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,758
a couple ways

287
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,599
actually three ways that i can get

288
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,240
findings in here i can start from

289
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,639
scratch

290
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
you know a custom finding just gives me

291
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,599
the blank fields

292
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,519
everything that we walked through when i

293
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,800
showed you a finding fully baked out

294
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,640
if you don't like what's in the finding

295
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,439
details you can always add those custom

296
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,120
fields

297
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
if you had added a template all those

298
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,519
custom fields would be here for you

299
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,120
from the start so the the methodology

300
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,640
for how you do that is the same

301
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,720
however you know the ultimate goal is to

302
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,800
save as much time as possible so we also

303
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,120
as i mentioned uh when i started this

304
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,640
have our write-ups database here the

305
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,880
write-offs database is nice

306
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,800
uh because once again no more copy and

307
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,560
pasting so say i found you know

308
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,359
something like an sql injection in the

309
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
environment

310
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,360
figure out what flavor it is that i'm

311
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,680
looking for and now what i've done is

312
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,600
i've pulled a local copy of this finding

313
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,319
and all the associated data that i've

314
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
saved

315
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,240
in that finding into this report

316
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,800
but i can modify this i don't have to be

317
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,600
happy with with what i had pre-canned

318
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,040
i can enrich this i can assign what the

319
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,959
affected assets were

320
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,079
i can collect additional parameters

321
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,680
should i desire

322
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,760
i can enrich it with screenshots and

323
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680
videos and code samples and all that

324
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,800
and when i'm when i'm doing all this and

325
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,599
i'm saving this

326
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,560
i'm not impacting the underlying master

327
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,880
copy of this

328
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,319
from the write ups database i'm just

329
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,399
making a local copy

330
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,720
however should i have done such a great

331
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,920
job of enriching and making this uh

332
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,240
better than it was

333
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
i'm always free to copy it back to the

334
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,560
write-ups database so i can use it in

335
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,640
the future

336
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,119
and and i don't have to to worry about

337
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,360
uh doing all those actions again

338
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
i'm not going to pollute my my data base

339
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,320
by by going down that route at this

340
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
point

341
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,279
so the so the third way that we can

342
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,560
bring in findings is from scanning tools

343
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,839
and i know we've made a lot of jokes

344
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,920
i've been listening over the last couple

345
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,880
days about passing off necessary courses

346
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,399
pen tests

347
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,959
but there is value to these tools at

348
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,320
least as a starting point a place to

349
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,920
triage from i showed here there's a

350
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
whole bunch of parsers that we we

351
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,199
currently support

352
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,279
we're adding new parsers all the time

353
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,000
it's pretty trivial for us to parse out

354
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,640
uh exports a little more in depth if we

355
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,640
want to integrate at the api level

356
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,079
but you know quite simply let me grab a

357
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,120
scanner sample here

358
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,399
of a very simple burp import

359
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,720
and we simply bring that in parses it

360
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,760
out

361
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
and now i have all of those all the data

362
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,240
that

363
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,760
came from that report that doesn't

364
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,760
matter if it's burp or nessus or

365
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,360
acunetix or any other things that we

366
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
support

367
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,640
it brings in all the information

368
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,599
directly from the scan tool parsing

369
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,000
it out as i mentioned earlier we also

370
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,600
tuck in the actual raw data the evidence

371
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
that comes from the scan tool some

372
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,040
people want that you know some

373
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,440
really aren't that interested but it's

374
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,439
there and it's available for you

375
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,360
but now just as with any of these other

376
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,000
findings i've got the ability to

377
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,760
further enrich and edit this you know

378
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,440
perhaps this was brought in by burp as a

379
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,959
hive but there's mitigating controls in

380
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,680
place i want to downgrade this to a

381
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,680
medium

382
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,880
i want to tag this with certain things

383
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,560
you know i want to start

384
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,720
you know indicating which of the the

385
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,640
miter attack

386
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,800
tactics that this was associated with

387
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,120
will say like initial access

388
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,880
can start doing all that stuff to

389
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,200
include any evidence i want to include

390
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,519
is screenshots and code samples

391
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
so at a high level uh in a very quick

392
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,440
abbreviated fashion

393
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,480
you know that is how i am getting the

394
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
data into

395
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
the report there's other data that i can

396
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,399
also throw into the concept

397
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,760
into the report you know oftentimes

398
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,320
there's artifacts that

399
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,920
are things that you want to capture that

400
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
just don't make sense to put into a

401
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,560
finding or any other structure of the

402
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,399
report

403
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
so i've got basically arbitrary file

404
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,920
storage can really put anything i want

405
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,880
perhaps i wanted to actually attach the

406
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,920
raw

407
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,439
xml of that report of that burp sample

408
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,319
into this and so now it's available for

409
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
the clients

410
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,760
actually inside of the report so i

411
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
mentioned

412
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,959
several times of making it available to

413
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,600
the clients because we really do

414
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,959
at flextrack want to change the paradigm

415
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,079
of delivering the

416
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,599
300 page pen test report

417
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,760
because quite frankly we know that

418
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,279
number one we're pairing

419
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,560
and down the data that we're putting

420
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,959
into the report everything that i

421
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,399
collect

422
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,599
i can't present to the client or make

423
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,320
available to the client so we're already

424
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,639
giving them an

425
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,519
abstracted version of what we're

426
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,680
collecting

427
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,200
but then they're trying to sort for the

428
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,359
signal through the noise

429
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,040
sift through this by putting the

430
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,800
information into a web-based platform

431
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,240
and giving them access

432
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,760
they've got the the ability to come in

433
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,959
here and find what they need pretty

434
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
quickly

435
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,079
how do i actually present it to the

436
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,920
clients well as i said i can give them

437
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,800
access to the platform we have fairly

438
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,760
robust

439
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,040
access control so in flextrac when i'm

440
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,760
provisioning a user

441
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,599
i can create them in one of several

442
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,360
aspects i can make them an admin a

443
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,480
standard user or this concept of the

444
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,160
analyst role

445
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,680
and so we've got a whole lot of our

446
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,240
clients today that are giving their

447
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,800
clients

448
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
access to flextrac with this analyst

449
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,920
function

450
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
they create them as a user and then by

451
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,479
default

452
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,240
they can get to a splash screen but they

453
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,240
have access to no data

454
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,360
and we think that's a good thing so they

455
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,360
then would

456
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
authorize them find the individual

457
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,639
client that they want to provide that

458
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,959
user access to

459
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,959
and then authorize the individual user

460
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,720
we still understand that in today's

461
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,480
world people still want documents right

462
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,920
we've still got to provide the document

463
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,279
based delivery so

464
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,519
a couple different things we can do

465
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,600
there as well we go back into our

466
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,480
original report here

467
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
we can export this to word markdown csv

468
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,959
when we ship plex

469
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,800
track we have a a default template in

470
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,680
there however the vast majority of our

471
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,479
clients

472
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,599
are using a custom template so we we

473
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,920
don't tell you that

474
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,839
yes you can export into a word document

475
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,079
and pick you know one of your five

476
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,519
flavors of ice cream that we support we

477
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,920
actually take whatever it is you're

478
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,560
using now your actual dot docx

479
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,639
we use the jinja 2 templating language

480
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,119
and we make it so that the data exports

481
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,920
into

482
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
you know your custom look and feel so if

483
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,160
i were to

484
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,560
just use the default template that we

485
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,480
have here today take it a couple seconds

486
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,399
to uh to parse that all out

487
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,920
we'll uh go ahead and pull up that file

488
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,240
sorry i'm going to grab that from

489
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,279
another screen forgot that i'm using

490
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,279
firefox and

491
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,639
it doesn't always want to

492
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,959
go where i wanted it to so let me grab

493
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,480
that

494
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,719
and there we go so here is

495
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,560
an example of what that looks like

496
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,800
completely baked out so we've got

497
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,399
you know the logos executive summary i

498
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,000
didn't show you the narrative section we

499
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,360
have a place for you to put all those

500
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
narrative things that would normally go

501
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,800
into the front of your document

502
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,120
and then we can start building it out

503
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,000
however you want to include

504
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,120
whatever tables you are interested in

505
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,560
those tags really

506
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,320
give us a whole lot of functionality to

507
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,638
to automatically do a lot of the

508
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,320
tabulation that you have

509
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,800
standard summary of finding tables and

510
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,880
things like that additional tabulations

511
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,880
but then we can format the actual

512
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,360
findings the detailed findings in

513
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,439
whatever format that you see fit

514
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,120
so obviously video this finally had a

515
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,959
video we still don't have a way of

516
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,959
embedding a video in a word document our

517
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,000
developers are hard at work on that

518
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,479
joking but you know ultimately this is

519
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,399
one example of how things could look

520
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,680
i've probably worked with about 60

521
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,000
different templates it's actually kind

522
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,079
of cool to see how all the different

523
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
shops out there report their data and

524
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,920
what they find

525
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,800
that they find interesting that's

526
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,719
completely up to you

527
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,040
you know ultimately that's all done as

528
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,480
part of our our onboarding process

529
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,240
and uh and uh happy to to show you guys

530
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,759
some other examples that at some point

531
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,360
however moving on to

532
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,959
the other thing that we all hate doing

533
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,959
which is building a powerpoint

534
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,959
presentation to do an outbrief

535
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,479
so the report is one artifact that we

536
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,119
usually have to present

537
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,560
at the end of the engagement however the

538
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,680
other thing is we gotta actually have

539
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,439
some sort of meeting

540
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,920
so we've got this awesome readout view

541
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,639
which prevents you from having to build

542
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,719
yet another

543
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,720
doctor another presentation in

544
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
powerpoint allows you to walk through

545
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,880
the executive summary

546
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,680
with the client and then just move

547
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,639
from finding to finding and find the

548
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,758
data that is

549
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,399
you know useful to the individual client

550
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,000
so you know i found that when i was a a

551
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,720
customer flextrack that this feature

552
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,399
alone

553
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,240
was uh was saving me you know just a

554
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,680
couple hours in each engagement that i

555
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,079
was doing

556
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,599
so that's kind of the big picture on on

557
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,599
how flex crack gets

558
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
information into a finding or into a

559
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,959
report and how we spit it out

560
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,320
but we also have some other features

561
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,160
that i'm just not going to have time to

562
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,959
i just want to tease for you

563
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,839
first one is our assessments module so

564
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,319
we understand

565
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,000
that you know often times security

566
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
begins with sitting across the table

567
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,959
from

568
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,839
a client and just going through a

569
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,079
questionnaire

570
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,678
this could be a framework based

571
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,438
questionnaire this could be

572
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,360
something that you just use to scope an

573
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,160
operation but the assessments module is

574
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,119
here

575
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,640
to really make it easy for the folks

576
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,918
that are doing things like

577
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,360
you know the cmmc or doing things

578
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,960
like those you know nist rms to

579
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,719
to to very quickly walk through

580
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,880
all of the questions in a given

581
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,280
questionnaire collect the data

582
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,640
as they see fit and this doesn't sound

583
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,760
and seem like it's really all that

584
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,840
exciting right

585
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,120
well what's really cool though is that

586
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,918
once i've gone through

587
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,879
all of this and i i have all those

588
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,400
questions done

589
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,080
i submit the assessment and i'm back in

590
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,320
the context of a report

591
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,639
and so now all of those questions that

592
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,559
existed in that assessment are now

593
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,799
in that same data structure so now i can

594
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,039
come back i can enrich the answers

595
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,480
i can modify what i saw in the

596
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,919
environment

597
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,320
to ensure that i i'm collecting all the

598
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,640
data

599
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,600
not just what i actually got sitting

600
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,039
across the table

601
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,039
and it's really allowed me to build a

602
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,640
more robust product so you can kind of

603
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,080
almost think of the assessments module

604
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,400
as a layer on topic

605
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,918
so yeah i see uh plextract does allow

606
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,679
recordings within the report

607
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,160
obviously we can't put those into into a

608
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,760
word export but but absolutely

609
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,440
that's just done once again as a

610
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
refresher over here in the screenshots

611
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
videos

612
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,439
and that's where you would upload that

613
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,600
information as well the other thing i

614
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,799
want to tease very quickly

615
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,639
is our analytics so we've talked a good

616
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,000
bit about tags and what we can do with

617
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,400
them

618
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,840
the nice thing here is now if i wanted

619
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,919
to see

620
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,480
okay what are all of the things that are

621
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,200
associated with this client i've got my

622
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,960
top

623
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,440
highest risk findings i can change the

624
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,480
number i've seen i can see the status

625
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,400
of these so this kind of can become

626
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,080
for your client you know they wake up

627
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,360
monday morning coming to work what am i

628
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,678
working on today

629
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,280
well it's right here but also you know

630
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,080
we added some finding tags i think we

631
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,760
added

632
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,639
one of the miter tactics here initial

633
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,520
access you know i can further sort

634
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,280
based on that and really drill down into

635
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,799
to just what i'm looking to see for that

636
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,720
so getting rid of that tag so i've got a

637
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,240
little bit of a bigger data set

638
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,400
additional things you can do here is

639
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,160
we got to break out by severity but then

640
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,440
also here you know you can see by the

641
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,799
report where am i getting

642
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
identifying the most risks in my

643
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,000
environment

644
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,760
what i really find very very useful

645
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,520
but isn't you know the most complicated

646
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,520
things in the world is just

647
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,039
quite simply you know how am i doing as

648
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,200
far as my remediation

649
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,480
am i am i winning or am i losing am i

650
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,880
opening more

651
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,320
findings that i'm closing obviously for

652
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,720
this demo account

653
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,399
or this client i've opened a whole lot

654
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,960
more you know but what i always tell

655
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,320
folks is

656
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,320
you know what you want to get to is a

657
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,480
point where your green is the same

658
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,480
size as your red that that way you know

659
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,080
that you're at least not racking up

660
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,840
more and more security debt over time

661
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,600
some folks want to see hey what are just

662
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,039
the things that i have found over the

663
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,240
course of the last

664
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,080
you know temporal time period here so

665
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,320
in the last 30 days you know what has

666
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,520
been that is newly discovered

667
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,520
that has not yet been remediated so

668
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,520
i want to save a little bit of time you

669
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,679
know i know this was fast and furious

670
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,879
however if you want to get the uh the

671
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,760
full treatment here

672
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,159
i highly encourage you to take a spin

673
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,799

hear me talking

685
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,799
at a much slower pace when i'm not

686
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,439
trying to to cram

687
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,280
an hour demo into about 20 minutes but

688
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,960
let me take a look here real quick

689
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,879
at some of the questions here we've

690
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,720
already talked about the ability to

691
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,919
import to recording so we know that

692
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,600
we've got that

693
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,679
but are there any other questions that

694
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,240
we've got going on that we can

695
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,039
see in the slack that looks like uh we

696
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,679
got brian

697
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,000
about to chat here yeah so uh hey brian

698
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,480
uh he dropped his email there he is uh

699
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,960
our

700
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,480
lead he's our vp of sales actually he'll

701
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,880
be your primary poc

702
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,960
i'm i'm the sales engineer here probably

703
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,240
don't talk nearly as eloquently as brian

704
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,320
but i can definitely talk faster which

705
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,320
is why i think i drew this straw

706
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,918
a master issue was for common things you

707
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,000
find uh as well

708
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,039
so that's really the concept of the

709
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,600
write-ups database

710
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,360
and so when we ship flextrac we have a

711
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,360
ton of things in here that we've pulled

712
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,879
from owasp and things like that

713
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,120
but you are free to modify any of these

714
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,080
um or create your master you know a new

715
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,760
master issue

716
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,320
if you will we call them a master

717
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,640
write-up and you can add as little or as

718
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,879
much

719
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,640
information as you want to include you

720
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,440
can even pre-populate this with custom

721
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,400
fields

722
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,919
you can pre-populate this with tags so

723
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
we've got a couple of our folks that are

724
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,280
building

725
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,760
out their write-ups database with all of

726
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,639
the

727
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,440
miter techniques so that that way when

728
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,799
they're actually

729
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,080
looking and trying to sort inside of

730
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,240
that they can just

731
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,000
you know tap they can look in and see

732
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,600
how is this thing tagged

733
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
and this particular one is tagged by

734
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,639
mitre burp sources other things that we

735
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,200
can

736
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,559
import by default today so let me just

737
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,159
grab any old client

738
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,480
and any old report and i'll show you

739
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,880
that list again real quick

740
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,720
so if i'm adding findings for a tool so

741
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,159
today acunetix burp

742
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,559
core impact nessus netsparker nexpose

743
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,679
nipper and you can read so it won't go

744
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,799
down the line

745
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,919
the um the other thing we we do

746
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,879
and i didn't really do a good job of

747
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,280
showing the actual uh assets that are

748
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,320
collected so each time you bring in

749
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,918
a scan report or you mainly create an

750
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,639
asset when you're manually creating a

751
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,559
report

752
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,640
we add that to the master inventory for

753
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,480
that client and so you can see for this

754
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,280
particular ip

755
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,120
you can see all of the findings across

756
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
all of the reports that are associated

757
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,879
with this

758
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,559
this is really helpful from a

759
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
remediation standpoint because we know

760
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,200
that

761
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,799
usually an analyst doesn't get a pen

762
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,240
test report your junior guide gets

763
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,879
handed a list of things are wrong with a

764
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,679
host

765
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,159
but what's also nice is if you wanted to

766
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,720
just

767
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,679
create a very quick and easy asset

768
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,679
inventory

769
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,799
you can also just drop an nmap scan in

770
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,200
here and

771
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,320
uh it'll populate all the discovered

772
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,080
hosts with what you got going on there

773
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,240
so and yep looks like we got those

774
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,678
questions about servicenow and jira

775
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,279
and you know if there's an integration

776
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,799
that you didn't see on that list

777
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,320
where we're adding them at about the

778
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,879
rate of one every two weeks and it's

779
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
just because

780
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,720
it's things that people are asking for

781
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,440
latest additions were core impact i

782
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,039
think

783
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,080
so if you didn't hear i think they uh

784
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,440
they just bought cobalt strike so that's

785
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,520
going to be kind of cool

786
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,480
all right i'm close to out of time i'm

787
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,559
expecting john

788

to grab the king here at any moment

789
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,559
