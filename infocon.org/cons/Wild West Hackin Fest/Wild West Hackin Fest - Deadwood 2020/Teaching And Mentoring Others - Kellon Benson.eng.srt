4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,220

really appreciate it I'm really excited

11
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,550
and terribly nervous to give this talk

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,418
it's my first time giving us off I want

13
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,189
to talk about something that I'm

14
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:29,419
passionate about really care about and

15
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,689
it's teaching and mentoring people

16
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:34,910
because I wouldn't be where I am today

17
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,710
without the teachers and mentors in my

18
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,160
life whether that be information

19
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:42,590
security related or just general life

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,050
lessons and this thing virtual is gonna

21
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,149
be kind of fun and interesting let's get

22
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,769
started so just a bit about me name's

23
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,570

25
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,480
hunter at Microsoft I enjoy tabletops

26
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,160
and video games and love learning IP is

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,690
a good - if we were at the column would

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,940
love to grab an IPA but you know when

29
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,920
you do virtually and I'm very typo crumb

30
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,200
so you'll do my Twitter you will see

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,470
that is very true so that's a bit about

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,090
me do you know anything about

33
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,490
information security I'm watching chat

34
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,960
as I do this so if you have answers feel

35
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,059
free to throw them in there and we'll

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,740
all engage with you guys you know I

37
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,210
would assume since we're all here at

38
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,509
wild what's happening to us some of us

39
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,520
know a thing about information security

40
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:27,350
who would say that they probably know

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,789
things outside information security that

42
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,280
have helped them get to where they are

43
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,680
right now just based on the previous

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,719
presentation it seems like sports and

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,579
information security are very relatable

46
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,710
who would have thought I think that

47
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,689
everybody is where they are today

48
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,929
because they've had someone in their

49
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:47,360
life or someone's who have taught them

50
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,090
encouraged them or challenged them in

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,579
some way that's honestly why I'm here

52
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,729
right now giving a talk I had someone

53
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:57,020
say to me you know you should you should

54
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,270
do that you did great

55
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,920
talking it who slided - anyways the

56
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,658
other night and I was like yeah that was

57
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,549
crazy I don't think that makes me

58
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,430
capable of giving a talk about things

59
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,140
but here I am I want to go into a bit of

60
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,110
my story and tell you about where it

61
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,268
came from and some of the people who

62
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,870
really poured into me and really helped

63
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:18,260
me because

64
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,230
Who I am I grew up in rural Washington

65
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:26,239
State where my high school computer

66
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:28,220
class was typing I then spent my time in

67
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,099
the computer class teaching myself other

68
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,720
things like Photoshop and other things

69
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:35,290
that were not completely relevant to my

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,180
class may have got in trouble I also

71
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,150
managed to fail high school algebra and

72
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,519
a few other classes I really thought

73
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,140
school was dumb and I really just needed

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,110
to get my high school degree because the

75
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,119
plan was to skip out on college and skip

76
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,610
the American dream so I could be a

77
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,910
freelance graphic artist photographer I

78
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,250
was gonna you know live in a studio

79
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,140
apartment with six other strangers while

80
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,690
we worked at the same coffee shop to

81
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,489
pursue our artistic dreams that clearly

82
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:08,280
happened as I'm sitting here you know

83
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:11,130
quite the opposite I graduated high

84
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,470
school went to college and I bounced

85
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,930
between liberal arts degrees ranging

86
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:20,130
from communications religious studies

87
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,950
English until I decided that I would get

88
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,720
a degree in IT my oldest brother

89
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,000
suggested that I should get a degree in

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,100
IT he told me you know hey you're a nerd

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,240
you'd be good at that professionally I

92
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,890
was like oh I didn't even know that was

93
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,400
an option so I switched to an IT degree

94
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,339
and in the midst of earning my IT degree

95
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:43,110
I got a job at the help desk at my

96
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,210
college and slowly moved forward into an

97
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,010
information security analyst role which

98
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,890
was pretty crazy I did not think I was

99
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,679
qualified in the slightest so I was

100
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,630
going to school working full-time I got

101
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,340
married bought a house and you know I

102
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,980
did everything that I said I wasn't

103
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,590
gonna do in high school I still me would

104
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,790
probably be very disappointed in me

105
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,980
anyways

106
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,829
during my time in college I had some

107
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,840
pretty great people who weren't into my

108
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,790
professors there were some guest

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,570
speakers I connected with and I just had

110
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,010
really good peers who we just built on

111
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,630
each other we ended up building a

112
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,730
cybersecurity Club because we were like

113
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,280
hey we want to know more and do more and

114
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,720
learn from everybody else so when I

115
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,030
moved into the working world of a

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,400
security analyst I got the privilege of

117
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,010
working alongside of the people who

118
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,370
literally laid the groundwork for the

119
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,050
internet at the University I was at like

120
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,180
they laid the cable and they plugged

121
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,610
those cables in and brought Internet to

122
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,520
the University so those are the people I

123
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,960
got to learn from as a security analyst

124
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,060
whenever I have a question

125
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,430
no matter how simple they would take

126
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,680
time to answer that question and explain

127
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,420
it in great detail I would become lost

128
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,550
at some point and just sit there and nod

129
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,890
and smile and try to take in what was

130
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,600
happening they were just infrastructure

131
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,969
and networking Wizards as I like to call

132
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,880
them they hated that because they were

133
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,710
very humble individuals about three

134
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,350
months into this brand new security

135
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,930
analyst role I was asked by a professor

136
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,990
to come and guest speak at the

137
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,140
cybersecurity Club in her classes about

138
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:23,850
my life as a security analyst and

139
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:28,169
was like but why I'm brand new I don't

140
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:30,300
know anything I am really unsure of why

141
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,680
you want me to come into your class and

142
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,350
talk about what it's like to be a

143
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,240
security analyst I had no idea what I

144
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,570
was doing in my job I was still training

145
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,729
learning so I said yes of course

146
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,808
as you do

147
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,359
I talked about the things that I was

148
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:47,069
just doing on a daily basis how I was

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,969
learning the things I was learning I

150
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,669
thought they were completely

151
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:53,819
uninterested and that it was horrible so

152
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:57,029
I'm gonna fast forward about about three

153
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,159
weeks ago to when I started my job as a

154
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:01,050
threat hunter and I walked in to my

155
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:04,830
brand-new job and I meet my supervisor

156
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:08,219
we shake hands he was a student in that

157
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,889
class that I guess spoken that's crazy

158
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:13,498
to me and he told me that he remembered

159
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,659
that talk I gave that day and that he

160
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:19,349
found it helpful that's such a cool

161
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:21,319
feeling and as I was getting introduced

162
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:23,878
to the rest of the team at this new job

163
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,059
another person walked in and they

164
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,710
introduced themselves and they said hey

165
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:30,599
I don't know if you remember me but you

166
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,430
spoke in a class I was in a few years

167
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,180
ago and I took the things you talked

168
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:39,030
about home I tried them I applied them I

169
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,940
learned from them and now I'm here

170
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:45,030
that person is a full-time threat

171
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,630
intelligence person at Microsoft holy

172
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,299
cow

173
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:52,469
that's crazy like I am so humbled by

174
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,100
that just blown away I'm gonna travel

175
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,620
back in time a little bit farther to

176
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,090
when I finally bit the bullet decided

177
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,000
that I was gonna take time testing with

178
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:05,820
Kali and earn my osep after years of

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,190
trying to be ready I put together a blog

180
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,310
that I was gonna track my progress talk

181
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:15,000
about my failures successes mostly for

182
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:18,200
my benefit of like okay what did I learn

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,850
and it turned into people actually

184
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,000
engaging with this talking on these

185
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,880
posts and sharing information it became

186
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,770
very helpful surprisingly I put together

187
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,950
this way I would consider very

188
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,710
unpolished mediocre blog with some gifts

189
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,479
in it because gifts are the only way to

190
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,560
communicate on the Internet just skip

191
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,380
over the words get to the moving

192
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,300
pictures please it turned out to be

193
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,240
helpful for some people which i think is

194
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,570
amazing and crazy honestly

195
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,670
and then I failed my osep as one does on

196
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,830
their first try and I put out a joke

197
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,860
tweet as you can see on my slides I did

198
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,870
not pass them my first try am a ask me

199
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,940
anything complete joke it was really

200
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,920
just a poke fun at myself you know I

201
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,310
have a self-deprecating sense of humor

202
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,160
it helps me cope with my failures but it

203
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,570
actually turned into a conversation on

204
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,640
Twitter where people were engaging

205
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,260
sharing their experiences being

206
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,760
encouraging saying hey like you'll get

207
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,130
it next time people sharing their

208
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,610
stories and just a general advice or

209
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,620
taking that exam which is really cool a

210
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,960
joke turned into something that actually

211
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,180
was helping people and I really wouldn't

212
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,830
be doing these things learning the

213
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,620
things I learned doing what I have done

214
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,480
without the help of the people who have

215
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,360
challenged me to go ahead and do these

216
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,960
things like being here talking to all of

217
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,870
you like guests speaking in a class like

218
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,450
posting a blog about my successes and

219
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,070
failures it took people in my life

220
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,410
pushing me to do those things and

221
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,360
encouraging me through that and offering

222
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,120
advice about how to do that

223
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,209
people like my mentors my co-workers

224
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,829
professors throw back to a high school

225
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:02,339
teacher who said something that has

226
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:06,209
stuck with me to this day and I will

227
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:09,209
never forget it you have got to learn to

228
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:11,790
learn man I hated high school but I

229
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:13,319
learned so many things just from that

230
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,329
phrase and if you take nothing away from

231
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,500
this talk or the words that I'm saying

232
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:20,130
just just grab that and run with it

233
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,810
people on the Internet

234
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,029
turned into people encouraging me

235
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,800
offering up mentorship type advice to

236
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,959
myself and other people I've learned

237
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,120
from students at the University I was

238
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,079
working at I'd run into somebody in the

239
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,209
hall and they'd be like oh you're

240
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,649
security analyst here now we get talking

241
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,630
and they would start talking about some

242
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,250
vulnerability or CVE they're reading

243
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,980
about and I would learn about something

244
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,950
new and interesting from them

245
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,260
also my mom shoutout to my mom she

246
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,450
taught me so many things absolutely

247
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,579
would not be where I am today without my

248
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,410
mother who through her words and actions

249
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:54,779
just taught me to keep pushing even when

250
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,120
everything seems like it's falling apart

251
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,850
and it's garbage because it'll get

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,649
better and you can do the thing so what

253
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,709
about you what about all you hanging out

254
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,990
in chat do you know things you do know

255
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:08,729
things and you can't disagree with me

256
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,620
right now because you cant type as fast

257
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,160
as I'm talking and telling you you know

258
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,040
things you have the ability to each

259
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,290
people those things you know you have a

260
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,779
very unique perspective on the things

261
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:25,290
you know whether that is a technical

262
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:27,269
thing or it's just a life lesson you

263
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,699
have your words to share that and the

264
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:32,190
feeling you get when you have shared the

265
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:34,649
things you know with someone and later

266
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:37,680
you see them doing something really

267
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,949
wicked cool is incredible speaking from

268
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,140
experience working alongside people and

269
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:45,769
below people who I guess look in a class

270
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,160
that's insane to me I I'm baffled I'm

271
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:51,570
speechless or how that makes me feel

272
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,680
your voice is important and I say that

273
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:58,170
because I can't tell you how many blogs

274
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,239
white papers videos conversations it

275
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,880
took me to finally understand stack

276
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,160
based buffer overflow and finally I

277
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,019
found something that just made it click

278
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,509
for me it was explained differently a

279
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,959
way that it was done just made sense and

280
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:15,300
you could create or say that thing also

281
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,939
can you encourage somebody absolutely

282
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,339
you have the ability to date you know

283
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,740
you can do it you can do the thing

284
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,329
you're awesome you might have a friend

285
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,889
who is trying to get an information

286
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:28,170
security or just getting a job in

287
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:29,519
general and they're like I don't know if

288
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,860
I should lie I don't know if I have the

289
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,389
right skill set and you are the person

290
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,670
who could stand and be like hey you

291
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:40,319
can't apply you should apply you have

292
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:42,870
these skills for example B maybe you are

293
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:43,620
doing a guy speaking or doing a lab or

294
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,490
something like that

295
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,610
and you see someone who looks

296
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,379
discouraged and frustrated and just is

297
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,839
uninterested in whatever it is you could

298
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:54,300
take the time to step out and talk to

299
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,329
that person and help them out tell a

300
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,128
story about when you had the same kind

301
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:01,439
of experience where you were staring at

302
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:02,670
a script you were trying to run and I

303
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:04,079
just kept failing and failing and

304
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,229
failing and it turned out you were just

305
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,170
missing a space that's never happened to

306
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,509
me or you know some kind of small syntax

307
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,790
there I'm sure we've all got those

308
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:16,649
stories you can challenge somebody you

309
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,660
can push somebody to try something

310
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,720
that's outside their comfort zone like I

311
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,100
am here today I wouldn't be like I said

312
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,689
so many times I wouldn't be doing this

313
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,790
if I didn't have people in my life

314
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,740
pushing me to try this thing I'm a

315
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,540
mentor of mine they thought that I

316
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:36,509
should just give it a try I was like ah

317
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,790
no I'm not good at that but they said no

318
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:40,589
you can be and you will be and you have

319
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,990
the ability to do that too with people

320
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,870
you work alongside of and finally this

321
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,230
is so important you can learn from the

322
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:51,870
people that you are teaching encouraging

323
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,610
and challenging stay stay humble in

324
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,319
these situations work to learn from

325
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,059
those people like I said I've learned

326
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:58,559
from just students who's taught me in

327
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,630
the hall at the University I was that I

328
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,850
learned from my co-workers all the time

329
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:06,240
random people on the internet it just

330
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:08,550
takes a attitude of humility and being

331
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,410
teachable and realizing that if you are

332
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,969
having some type of teaching mentoring

333
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,589
relationship with somebody that person

334
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:17,380
can teach you things

335
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,970
I had to include this tweet because it

336
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,310
said everything that I've been trying to

337
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,050
say in this presentation so well none of

338
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,880
us need permission or search or see bees

339
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,829
or degree to learn from others and share

340
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,400
our skills and knowledge we can all do

341
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:32,710
that you don't have to be some kind of

342
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,920
information security rockstar social

343
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,900
media mogul influencer or whatever you

344
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,599
know things that other people can learn

345
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,920
from how do you get engaged in this I'm

346
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,410
sure you have a high school uh primary

347
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,199
from something near you that might have

348
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,790
a computer class of some kind maybe

349
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,400
there's a CyberPatriot Club if you're

350
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,380
unfamiliar CyberPatriot Club it is a

351
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,840
club where students get to come around

352
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,000
and learn information security doing

353
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,910
Blue team type things learning like how

354
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,530
to set up a secure device or learn

355
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,810
command blind and that sort of thing

356
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:08,020
it's really fun to go to those and

357
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,000
engage with students at that because you

358
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,550
can learn things from them I promise

359
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,590
same thing with the computer class maybe

360
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,260
there's a career fair and you can just

361
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,330
go sit at a table for half an hour and

362
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,060
how people come to you and ask you about

363
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,320
your job can just tell people about what

364
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,819
you do and how you got there

365
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,190
you can write a blog even if it's one

366
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,780
post even if it's short dare not

367
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,340
knowledge on the Internet peer list is a

368
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,470
great place to do it it's an information

369
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,600
security type of blog site that I found

370
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,810
that's where I put my stuff you're not

371
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,730
into social media maybe you spin up a

372
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,079
server on the internet and you allow

373
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,160
people to log into your server and pull

374
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,290
your text files down

375
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,459
I'm sure that's viable as well and then

376
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,349
you're teaching people how to do file

377
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,240
transfers and not just going to an

378
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,030
internet site so you're teaching people

379
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,590
to types good on you or you're like I

380
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,290
don't want to write my writing is bad

381
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:59,330
make a video you can just talk through

382
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,310
what you're doing maybe you don't want

383
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:05,420
to talk you can just drag your mouse

384
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:07,489
around and use the notepad and type in

385
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,829
very simple notes and put some sweet

386
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,070
like tint wave or dubstep over the top

387
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:15,980
of your video kids love that I watched

388
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,260
those videos you have people around you

389
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,970
that you can engage with your your

390
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,350
bosses your co-workers maybe of junior

391
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,600
staff that you can teach the

392
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,660
opportunities are there you can take

393
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,640
steps to teach and engage with people or

394
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,280
maybe you give a talk you know you you

395
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,140
can do this you can do a talk at a

396
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,420
virtual con you can do a talk at a live

397
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,060
con maybe you live in an area with like

398
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,469
hacker meetups and they just want

399
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,969
somebody to talk for ten minutes about

400
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,740
literally anything you can do that but

401
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,360
what if I suck I'm sure there are some

402
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,390
people who are like no but really I

403
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,660
actually suck in the immortal words of

404
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:55,550
Jake the doc sucking at something is the

405
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,400
first step to becoming sort of good at

406
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,770
something and man is that true I would

407
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,220
not be where I am today if I didn't suck

408
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,780
at something first and no one in this

409
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,490
industry would be where they are today

410
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,699
if they didn't suck at something first

411
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,410
you have to practice how to be good at a

412
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,000
thing whether that's teaching whether

413
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,130
that's mentoring whether that's

414
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,990
encouraging people you know practice

415
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,760
makes perfect is what this boils down to

416
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:24,529
but I like Jake the dogs version more

417
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,899
he's adorable and I think it's funny

418
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:29,089
that kind of draws fight talk to an end

419
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,990
i i'd love to engage with you guys

420

00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:59,839
please shoot me a message on discord

430
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,129
Twitter whatever like I said sucking at

431
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,429
something is how you get good at

432
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:08,240
something and I would love to get better

433
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:10,809
at this Kellan thank you so much sir

434
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,419
appreciate you sharing your personal

435
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:16,939
experiences I know I can relate to a lot

436
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:19,039
of those experiences myself you know one

437
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:23,089
of the things that I drew out of your

438
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,280
talk Kellan is that telling a story when

439
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,899
you're presenting is very personal right

440
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,570
it's something that comes from you and

441
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,090
it's what you're trying to communicate

442
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,250
to other people and and and it's only

443
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,168
your story it's not anybody else's story

444
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,659
so you know that's an important message

445
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:40,970
for everybody to hear and it's also

446
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:44,149
important I think and you did point this

447
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,890
out Callum that that story is is

448
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:48,500
something that's a that's a narrative

449
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,600
that's unique in your head and you will

450
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,669
have always a unique perspective so

451
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,199
great information my friend and

452
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:58,850
appreciate you sharing that with us so

453
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,549
for everybody that's attending the talk

454
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:05,149
please continue the conversation with

455
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:08,240
Kellan in the track one talks I do want

456
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:11,449
to remind you about the CTF that is

457
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,270
running the CTF channel is there on

458
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,220
discord I believe it's called meta CTF

459
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,649
if you want to get involved in that

460
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,960
please go ahead and ask questions and

461
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:22,340
and and see what you can do there as

462
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,830
soon as we have a little bit of time

463
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,840
here does anybody else have any

464
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,750
questions that they want to ask of

465
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,789
Kellan related to to his talk and we'll

466
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,110
just take a few minutes here feel free

467
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:38,600
to ask them directly in the GoToWebinar

468
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:41,000
question box or directly in

469
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,370
in inside of discord because I'm

470
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,919
watching both to questions anybody I

471
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,199
think I thought one earlier on staff

472
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,809
that said did you want to be a threat

473
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,720
hunter at a large corporation so that's

474
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:57,139
a good question kill anything honestly

475
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,870
no I had no intentions of moving to a

476
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,900
large corporation at all or being a

477
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:05,299
threat hunter I actually went after the

478
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,780
pen testing with Cali stuff and osep

479
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:12,350
because I wanted to be a breaker of

480
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,120
things not a fixer of things but it

481
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,689
turns out that you can translate those

482
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,949
skills to one another and it's being on

483
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,230
the defensive side is actually a lot of

484
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,330
fun I think that's probably where I was

485
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,640
headed subconsciously without knowing it

486
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:29,449
honestly with the way my brain works and

487
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,160
like my interest in how computers work

488
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,710
and how computers should work was the

489
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:37,190
optimal configuration for a computer to

490
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,750
be secure sure yeah I found that super

491
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,549
interesting and for some reason it

492
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,530
translates better to blue than it did to

493
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:44,360
red because I was like oh I brake the

494
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,030
thing somebody will want to fix it but I

495
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,030
feel a little bit more empowered to be

496
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,620
saying like oh here's how this is being

497
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,600
taken advantage of and here's how we fix

498
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,959
it in a live environment so that's kind

499
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,780
of cool

500
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,480
so I I have a question for you or maybe

501
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:02,330
just a comment we'll take this as it

502
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,970
comes but but Kevin you know it seems to

503
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,850
me and I'm a red teamer and penetration

504
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:10,220
tester for my day-to-day existence but

505
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,168
it seems to me in the last I would say

506
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,500
four to five years that we've seen

507
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:18,470
tremendous advances in terms of the

508
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:23,030
different tools that we have available

509
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:26,290
for defenders to be able to study and

510
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:28,660
analyze threat actor behaviors and

511
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,549
indicators of compromise and

512
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,240
environmental analytics and in things

513
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:38,660
that can give the blue team so much more

514
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,940
data and so much more evidence in a kind

515
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,830
of boiled up fashion that we really

516
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,330
haven't had and you know some product

517
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,490
examples of that you know on the

518
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,530
classics would be Microsoft you know the

519
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,150
threat analytics are platforms and some

520
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,620
of these other user behavior analytics

521
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,780
platforms and I'm the

522
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,399
since that uh you know things are

523
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,950
getting better for the blue side I

524
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,490
wonder if you have have any thoughts on

525
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,050
that you'd like to share yeah I mean

526
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,630
coming out of the University space and

527
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,669
kind of the tools we have there and just

528
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,710
thinking about you know like how we were

529
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,840
looking at data and where and how I

530
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,870
wanted to be looking at data it was

531
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,629
migrating more towards behavioral type

532
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,750
things because that was the way to find

533
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,240
bad I think and like I think people are

534
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,780
starting to realize that it's not just

535
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,450
somebody pops

536
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,790
Who am I into a command prompt but it's

537
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,730
the context around that Who am I or that

538
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:33,920
ipconfig you know that's a very simple

539
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,600
example but looking at the context

540
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,700
around those events to look at the

541
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,559
behavior pieces because I think I mean I

542
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,450
spent time in bro

543
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,870
digging through Splunk logs looking for

544
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:47,240
the bad IP address that was hot that day

545
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,610
and like that wasn't always necessarily

546
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,890
the best thing to be doing does that

547
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:55,040
kind of answer that question yeah I

548
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:57,260
think it does I mean I I I'm actually

549
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,350
somewhat encouraged I mean when I first

550
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,970
started to look at some of the tools

551
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:04,610
available in the information security

552
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,350
industry from a defender perspective you

553
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,169
know with this is many many years ago

554
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,760
now and all anybody really could say was

555
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,500
make sure that you're logging things

556
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,140
centrally and make sure that you have a

557
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,330
sense of your assets you know and sort

558
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,679
of syslog was the best thing you had and

559
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,169
things like Splunk was starting to

560
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:25,240
emerge but you know it was tough because

561
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:28,070
a lot of defenders were really

562
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,740
overwhelmed by the volume of information

563
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,000
they were having to sort through and

564
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,790
there wasn't a lot of good work

565
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,210
happening in the artificial intelligence

566
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:41,240
and machine learning space to try to do

567
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,860
some volume analysis and give you a

568
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,750
better sense of what was going on and

569
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,389
I'm feeling more optimistic today

570
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,520
because of some of the advances I know

571
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,950
it's not perfect it still takes a really

572
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,040
knowledgeable human to interpret that

573
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:57,080
data into properly tuned systems but it

574
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,870
feels like it's more of an even playing

575
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,050
field today than it used to be if you do

576
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:04,909
the right things in terms of acquiring

577
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,480
various technology and personnel to to

578
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,270
implement

579
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,010
defenses inappropriate ways yeah I know

580
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:13,129
I would totally agree with that it is

581
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,570
becoming a bit more simple I think that

582
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,100
their technologies coming out that help

583
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,799
you understand your environment rather

584
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,879
than just being stuck daring it logs all

585
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,710
they trying to make sense of your

586
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,200
environment and what the normal is I

587
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,490
think defenses is getting some cool new

588
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,490
tools that will be really helpful
