1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,180
my name is Michael the talk title again

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,120
is help me help you hurt yourself this

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,739
park was created by just some

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,709
observations and things seen in the

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,720
field again just a quick disclosure has

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,970
been taken from various companies and

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,250
various items that I've seen with regard

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,740
to testing both on the client and on the

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,960
tester side again the statements made

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,209
are mine and not necessarily my

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,850
employers I loved my job I really

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,609
Jory testing / secure works and other

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,829
than that I mumble a lot and quickly

14
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:37,840
kind of get lost sometimes so if I look

15
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:39,790
like a deer in headlights just us on

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,579
some comments on this board and all

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,309
right you focus a little bit about

18
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:47,680
myself my name is Michael I go by the

19
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:49,989
handle Vega when they do testing I like

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,660
stars something about myself my twitter

21
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:54,849
is the handle data class just because I

22
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,669
like musician again past experiences

23
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,190
worked for an antivirus company did some

24
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,989
DoD contracting did some adversarial

25
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,599
medical device testing and now I

26
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:08,740
currently work at SecureWorks doing net

27
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:10,298
pen OPSEC web services writing stuff and

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,940
basically anything else I can kind of

29
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:15,640
research and test and we get gotten to

30
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,610
so you may ask yourself why and why this

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,830
test later talk may be pertinent again

32
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,110
its field level observations that I've

33
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,298
seen these are things that can both

34
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,490
improve the quality of life and we call

35
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:29,590
you test both us testers and clients

36
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,210
again both testers and clients can

37
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,060
benefit from clear and effective

38
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,880
communication and a lot of these samples

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,650
again are just examples of items where

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,020
communication may have broken down and

41
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,960
each of that money was wasted and

42
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,640
necessarily efforts as well me myself I

43
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,579
actually like my clients I want their

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,530
infrastructures be well I want them to

45
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,020
be stronger after the test and I would

46
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,100
like them to actually take action

47
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,530
against the findings that I actually

48
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,059
have presented with as testers sometimes

49
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,399
you may find that the more pain that you

50
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,439
inflict on a report again at the end the

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,320
stronger that client will be because a

52
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,059
malicious actor is not going to doing

53
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,378
that to their business instead it's

54
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,979
going to be me in a very controlled

55
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,598
environment

56
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,840
reporting in real-time what may be

57
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:15,910
occurring we hope is that each client

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,800
will have everything to go

59
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,900
to the start of the test again so when

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,940
we go ahead and start testing we can go

61
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,360
ahead and hit the environment that's

62
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,680
ready and again ready for our objectives

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,420
which again is to test them

64
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,550
that's the penetration testers we get

65
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,440
put into some interesting scenarios

66
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,960
clients would like to sometimes have

67
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,180
huge scope nationwide a nation-state

68
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,370
attack the simulation going against like

69
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,680
multiple targets in one week's time

70
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,240
which again can get kind of interesting

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,190
given the scope that sometimes some

72
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,080
people provide they expect us to be

73
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,359
wizards again in our test and a lot of

74
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,240
times we use show ample amounts of

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,420
registry or wizardry however again in

76
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,430
some cases 10,000 IP addresses and

77
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,619
possibilities and you don't even know

78
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,600
what you have within the and dozen IP

79
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,270
address range it can get kind of

80
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,070
interesting

81
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,170
again this will break go down into the

82
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,989
communication area in a moment but again

83
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,559
also as testers we can encounter a

84
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,360
numerous amount of technologies and we

85
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,120
have to basically adapt and attack those

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,150
again what would happen if you affected

87
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,250
community communicated effectively as a

88
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,720
client sorry these slides and tripped me

89
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,190
up because I didn't have words on them

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,620
they were all just pictures before at

91
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,020
b-side San Diego clients themselves

92
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,960
they'll say ton of money and with tests

93
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,760
these things go under a certain time

94
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,890
frame so if you don't have communication

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,750
going in a clear effective channel

96
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,149
necessarily before your test or during

97
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,890
it basically they are just going to take

98
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,840
that money and invalidate the test and

99
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,730
kind of burn it up in the air in the end

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,740
if you have effective communication in

101
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,390
the initial intake and during scoping

102
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,040
and basically throughout your engagement

103
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,200
you're gonna have that a result the

104
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,989
reason being is that it's better to work

105
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,940
together with a developer again from an

106
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,980
attack point of view if you have

107
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,440
questions like say to validate a finding

108
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,600
again this is going to be able to test

109
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,950
items again with development if you have

110
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,049
an open communication with the

111
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,089
development channel and then actually

112
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,220
get it COC exploit going versus somebody

113
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,738
who may just randomly read like

114
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,390
JavaScript pages and like understand I

115
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,640
would understand JavaScript better than

116
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,440
you in like an hour's time in the end

117
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,240
we'll all be happier during testing

118
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,620
times and we won't have to bug you for

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,300
any kind of missing info that you may

120
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,820
have left off during the initial scoping

121
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,620
meetings pesters I think are also

122
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,960
vulnerable to the same lack of

123
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,600
communication you as a tester will have

124
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,130
better test again if you have effective

125
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,170
communication on your scoping and on

126
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,659
your intake and on your actual testing

127
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,090
timeline which is fine if you're

128
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,620
basically if you ask the correct

129
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,780
questions and you get enough information

130
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,160
you'll have an exact roadmap of what's

131
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,559
going to be encountered during a test

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,690
that doesn't go for some s that a

133
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,010
smoothly black box but necessarily when

134
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,150
you're working with your client you want

135
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,340
to make sure that you get an ample

136
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,229
amount of information you're gonna be

137
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,280
able to do more with less time and

138
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,260
you're gonna be effective in that

139
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,150
timeframe that you have and also again

140
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,520
as reference before if you work together

141
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,650
with development possibly on a test you

142
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,870
may actually get older findings and if

143
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,000
you didn't basically you can turn a POC

144
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,650
or just I think that it does this into

145
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,790
an actual like

146
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,969
this will actually exploit something

147
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,420
clear communication what does it help

148
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,940
prevent

149
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,130
in the end it will help prevent copious

150
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,800
amount of disasters in a test at a

151
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,810
specific place basically the clients

152
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,540
internally was receiving information

153
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,240
that you know their application was

154
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,790
ready but their developers were being

155
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,470
somewhat shady they were replying with

156
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,540
screenshots versus login to the

157
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,240
application they were telling the app

158
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,070
owner basically this is how it runs not

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,960
really doing any kind of demonstrations

160
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,630
and this is all internal communications

161
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,000
so in the end I'm having to feel this

162
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,120
again my client and he's having to

163
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,260
contact his developers I have a $20 bet

164
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,390
but they're actually once is an

165
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,650
application on this test that we were

166
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,590
just going to be testing against

167
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,679
screenshots again as noted I got $10 of

168
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:11,590
those one of those $20 back in the end

169
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,450
again the app was not ready it was built

170
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,719
basically in half the time it was needed

171
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,310
but again UI elements everything was all

172
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,990
over the board and it did have a lot of

173
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,830
critical findings that were associated

174
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,090
with it

175
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:26,500
also pages were changing in real time so

176
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,799
literally code was being added as I was

177
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,630
testing so I would go to one page get a

178
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,070
cross-site scripting or other exploit

179
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,540
going and then the next day I would

180
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,090
return to the page and it was gone or

181
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,620
rewritten so again due to the additions

182
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,599
of code and after the fact in the

183
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,910
changing many elements the test was

184
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,410
invalidated because again the code that

185
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,320
was there during the testing timeline

186
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,430
was basically changed during the testing

187
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,950
time line so we were hitting moving

188
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,320
target this was all due to the lack of

189
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,090
communication on the client side with

190
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,670
his development team actually getting a

191
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,289
clear answer back sometimes we've also

192
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,050
been there where we will send an email

193
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,270
out and not necessarily get a response

194
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,160
back from somebody this has happened in

195
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,740
many a test one happens to me last week

196
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,290
where I requested a bit of email about a

197
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,570
user who needed to test a specific

198
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:16,900
function of a website I got that email

199
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,580
back however it was about a week late

200
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,500
because I had already gotten the report

201
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,120
generated and basically in the report

202
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,800
there was a lot of bold saving that we

203
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,080
could not necessarily test this function

204
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,870
because the business failed to reply to

205
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,430
multiple emails and messages and other

206
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,900
things trying to get in contact with

207
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,720
them to be able to try the test this

208
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,859
particular function again in the end due

209
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,750
to lack of communicate

210
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,730
during that timeframe money was

211
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:43,640
basically just burnt and thrown away

212
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:46,310
there's also the ace in which case

213
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,750
necessarily were viewed as an enemy lost

214
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,670
testers which is kind of interesting

215
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,090
considering that we were initially hired

216
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,880
by the business to benefit them

217
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,830
sometimes and in this particular example

218
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,170
basically during a test I was engaged in

219
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,909
we were had a lack of communication from

220
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,100
the administrators the administrator

221
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,990
would not reply back and we would never

222
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,680
receive anything and basically in short

223
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,210
we were told to pick to our scope and

224
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,460
again the questions and emails that I

225
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,409
was sending out in multiple times and

226
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,419
then going over his head to his

227
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,060
management team and he would refer them

228
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,310
to the admin answer again were

229
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,350
impertinence to the scope but during

230
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,090
that test because of those questions

231
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,010
went unanswered I stuck to my scope and

232
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,260
I was able to get domain administrator

233
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,689
and I recovered again a lot of useful

234
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,000
information passports driver's licenses

235
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,100
visas credit cards and the like and it

236
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,260
was a mess because some of the countries

237
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,850
were the passports and the visas and

238
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,409
everything were gathered from they don't

239
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,990
necessarily like to have that

240
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,120
information put in a report effective

241
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,120
communication during this time frame

242
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,490
would have basically resulted in a okay

243
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,290
what we can redact or like you know I do

244
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,910
redact a lot of information but we can

245
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,490
take off even more information and just

246
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,740
say that we had this in the report but

247
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,750
again because he client did not reply

248
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,370
back all of that put into the report

249
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,930
again for them to see because I like to

250
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,180
be verbose my reports I really would

251
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,089
like you to see what I have gotten in

252
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,010
these kinds of things and so that really

253
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,570
caused an issue but again it was due to

254
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,730
the lack of communication in that view

255
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,650
that we were a threat against I guess

256
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,810
his job necessarily even though I'm

257
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,579
trying to help them get as long as they

258
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,530
can security was but that lack of

259
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,970
communication again caused another issue

260
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,140
that could have been avoided had we

261
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,420
actually had that open line of

262
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,400
communication during our time testing

263
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,530
time line lack of communication and only

264
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,420
affect the person that is really lacking

265
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,010
the communication portion because you're

266
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,199
either gonna hurt yourself as a business

267
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,300
or you're not going to help yourself as

268
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,010
a tester and again we can't work

269
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,079
together as customers and clients and

270
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,900
clients and testers it is allowed we are

271
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,150
actually allowed to use cool things and

272
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,100
we should we should be stronger better

273
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,540
and faster and more productive and again

274
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,090
if you don't communicate clearly you may

275
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,430
lose a lot of money going on the tester

276
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,980
side a lack of communication I've seen

277
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,099
is interesting at least again according

278
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,820
home that I've observed as part of the

279
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,220
tester not ethos but archetype is one

280
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,800
time I was talking to my friend and he

281
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,680
is a tester but necessarily he likes to

282
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,569
go at everything like as as the black as

283
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,239
the boxes so he doesn't want to really

284
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,130
get soaked information he kind of just

285
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,350
wants to get an IP range and not ask

286
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,080
questions and then just hit it well in

287
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,140
his last test he was going against again

288
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,630
tests in North America his s targets are

289
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,490
in asia-pacific he's in North America

290
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,800
but necessarily his line of sight is

291
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,750
just a line of sight there are ways for

292
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,089
them to hit those boxes but not

293
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,460
necessarily enough information that was

294
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,140
gathered during the scoping to be able

295
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,320
to actually effectively target those

296
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,449
machines so due to that due to a lack of

297
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,310
engagement during the scoping and due to

298
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,170
a lack of information gathering and

299
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,359
basically just shut down a communication

300
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,219
on the tester side he was unable to

301
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,080
achieve the goals that he was supposed

302
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,290
to so again everything doesn't have to

303
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,690
be be black as the boxes me myself I

304
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,670
came into a test a couple weeks ago and

305
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,710
it was a massive external facing test

306
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,780
one week was just used to map out the

307
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:16,140
actual nodes that were in that

308
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:17,490
infrastructure and day 13 or 14 we

309
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,949
actually were able to successfully get

310
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,330
in to the infrastructure and I can do to

311
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,220
this we now have unity scope when you

312
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,230
set a clients and name targets to assess

313
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,260
and new kind of things defined and add

314
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,580
to the report in such a short time frame

315
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,590
again we want to make sure that we hit

316
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,360
all the high notes on that asking the

317
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,580
client you know effectively where are

318
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,940
your crown jewel you know what keeps you

319
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,560
up at night

320
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,030
so we asked them and you know they

321
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,010
replied back and we were able to get a

322
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,329
good test out of that because we asked

323
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,550
him as a shortened timeline you know

324
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,440
what would an attacker wants to target

325
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,530
in this infrastructure if they were able

326
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,230
to get in which we did and we did that

327
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,670
so again one more thing as I know we're

328
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,160
running short on time again he can

329
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,410
create beautiful things together in

330
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,480
DEFCON 27 located a public finding in

331
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,579
one of their medical devices again

332
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,070
communication started off great but

333
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,630
could be faltered on the client side

334
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,190
I was asked on all the right questions I

335
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,930
was trying to get information out of the

336
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,000
client and trying to learn more

337
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,709
information about the issue the

338
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,560
background of the actual

339
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,600
widget that I was able to do the thing

340
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,430
on and necessarily due to the

341
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,740
classification of this device we could

342
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,959
have actually created policy on how to

343
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,360
test these devices in the future instead

344
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,460
that didn't happen so necessarily I had

345
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,130
to let the mediation take over and then

346
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,420
a new Cee was added because of that but

347
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,990
again we could have also created

348
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,699
policies that went along to go with an

349
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,470
example of what you would do in a

350
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,840
scenario of if somebody brought a beta

351
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,630
device the DEF CON to test that that was

352
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,860
just wasted so typically we just wasted

353
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,150
a lot of months just trying to get

354
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,130
standard finding out that should have

355
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,990
really taken a little bit of time but

356
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,550
again since communication broke down we

357
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,800
couldn't really work together we had to

358
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,900
go through a third party and it just

359
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,819
extended the timelines about one key

360
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,090
know is that again you really don't want

361
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:07,310
to be kind of like means or just you

362
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:09,110
know abrasive to your clients and also

363
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,030
likewise to your testers you really

364
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,250
don't know who is going to be your

365
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:16,040
coworker in the future again due to that

366
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,420
be nice be open and be communicative if

367
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,920
somebody asks you a question you can

368
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,990
just be honest and be simple and be

369
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,939
direct very simple and again effective

370
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,680
communications and the testing scenarios

371
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,320
that I've seen can really help them a

372
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,140
lot of money waste and time waste on the

373
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,390
tester side and last I don't go messing

374
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,670
with your tester it has a CDSs of 11

375
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,319
that's my friend's son Willis again

376
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,510
shout out to Willis because again this

377
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,190
is like the face that you would see when

378
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,290
I tell somebody that and this guy's just

379
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,750
like really kind of messing with me

380
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,219
because I don't know why and again it

381
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,690
goes back to the prior example maybe

382
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,790
they just don't like us because of like

383
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,560
what we do that there's the people and

384
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,730
they have emotions in the various

385
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,260
companies that I work for I've seen a

386
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,660
lot of things and a lot of acrobatics

387
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,740
you should be faster feeling guilted or

388
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,360
like they were like saying man this

389
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,280
guy's just like totally like sending me

390
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,800
off on a walk these days or like XY and

391
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,510
Z but again they have taught their have

392
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,189
talent they have goals and they have

393
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,930
objectives but again sometimes they also

394
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,090
don't have lives and like things that

395
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,040
they do outside of these things again

396
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,750
just play nice on the playground and I

397
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,790
think everybody will have a better time

398
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,490
this goes out to just being a better

399
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:23,050
communicator and I'm not being fairly so

400
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,050
abrasive and communications
