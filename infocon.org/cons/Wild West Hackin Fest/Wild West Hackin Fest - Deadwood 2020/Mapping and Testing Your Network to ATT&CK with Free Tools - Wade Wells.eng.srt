1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,479
so we've got wait on wait are you here

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,060
and ready to go sir yes I am here kami I

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,120
can you are now the presenter waiting on

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,430
you to present your slides and with that

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,730
I would say let's take it away sir go

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,110
for it all right so I got 15 minutes so

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,150
thank you guys thank you John thank you

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,820
everything just so quick to go through

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,380
the talk yes I am mapping my network to

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,480
the mitre attack framework and then

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,570
testing it for free though also trying

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,239
to wrangle in threat intelligence so

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,030
real quick to show you the three tools

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,769
I'm using our attack navigator detect an

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,989
atomic red team all of them are

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,180
absolutely free and you can pick them up

17
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,860
with us simply on github the big thing

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,170
what happened to me was my boss asked me

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,870
what can i detect and how are we gonna

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,700
keep track of it so me being stupid just

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,410
dived right into it thinking it to be

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,010
easy then realizing this was not an easy

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,809
task

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,399
figuring out what I can detect I had to

25
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,519
try to figure out a framework in order

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,489
to judge the any type of tax coming in

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,259
and then I spawned other questions like

28
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,298
how am I going to keep track of all the

29
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:09,359
attacks that I am detecting how am I

30
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,340
gonna grade them then also I also heard

31
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,979
John's favorite thing I do threaten tell

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,289
so I also want to try to work that in as

33
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,639
well so the first thing I decided to

34
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:19,139
really jump into is the miter attack

35
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:20,770
framework just going to do a quick

36
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:22,210
overview of

37
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,440
well it appears that Wade is having

38
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,720
technical difficulties with his

39
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,970
microphone and well it looks like Wade

40
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,260
is gone now no I'm joking Wade here's

41
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,260
your here's your mic back

42
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:36,679
oh no it looks like I muted him and then

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,079
he really went away it was just a joke I

44
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:52,969
can't bring him back I'm gonna send him

45
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:56,619
an onion all right so just a quick

46
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:59,568
overview the minor tack framer Reich

47
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:03,200
totally based off of cyber kill chain

48
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:05,239
right here's a huge picture of it so

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,789
just like you guys know there's 11

50
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:10,160
tactics with 200 and around 266

51
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,930
different techniques so my big hurdle

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,940
was how am I gonna display what I can

53
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,370
detect out of this the first thing I

54
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,650
decided to do was to use confluence and

55
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,019
so I made 11 confluence pages for each

56
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,890
tactic and then slowly started going

57
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:26,930
through each through each initial

58
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,390
technique and then writing my alerts in

59
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,340
Sigma got about 60 techniques in when I

60
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,559
realized this was not scalable and not

61
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,989
good at all and I almost killed myself

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,600
so the one thing I found that I did like

63
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,160
was the miter attack navigator so the

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,138
miter attack navigator of course is also

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,750
free it's easy use easy configurable

66
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:47,720
runs off of angular no js' and that the

67
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:50,090
main thing it consumes is JSON files my

68
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,010
last favorite is there's plenty of free

69
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,569
resources out there for it too big

70
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,030
resources I found that a lot of people

71
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,488
don't know that matter provides is

72
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:02,000
actual attacker evaluations for tools

73
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,230
and then thread Intel on groups now you

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,880
gotta take both of these with a grain of

75
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,738
salt right you don't can't trust them

76
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,569
absolutely you can see when the groups

77
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,819
have been updated last you can also see

78
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:12,888
when the tools are updated but I used

79
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:16,190
these in order to pivot off some other

80
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:18,410
stuff so here is an attack tactic right

81
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,750
so here all the iranian act act ixnay on

82
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,519
TTP's that they use really liked how

83
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,269
this looked out and I figured I could

84
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,099
use this somehow to map what I detected

85
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,900
what's also really nice is if you hover

86
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,638
over it it gives you some basic notes

87
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,079
and a little bit of a little it does a

88
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,130
little bit other things do you notice

89
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,870
there's a bunch of tools in the

90
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,480
right-hand side I'm not gonna go over

91
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,919
what they all do but there's a lot of

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,448
power there in them just because I'm

93
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,609
gonna run out of time one of the cool

94
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:45,170
things too is you can combine two

95
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:48,080
different apt groups

96
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,329
here's a good example of apt 3 and 29

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,370
and then the legends down in that bottom

98
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,680
right-hand corner really like this and

99
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,380
my initial thought was maybe I can edit

100
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,569
that JSON file that gets uploaded into

101
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,900
the miter attack viewer with my notes

102
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:05,269
maybe with what I can detect and make it

103
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,739
look awesome Ridge '''l I was gonna

104
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,239
write something myself in order to edit

105
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:10,250
that JSON and then I was like you know

106
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,870
what I'm not that great of a programmer

107
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,700
and there's probably someone else out

108
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,040
there who did it much better and what do

109
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:19,010
you know there was I found this program

110
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,930
called detect which is detect tactics

111
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,550
techniques and combat threats so the

112
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,070
main thing it does is it helps you map

113
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,470
your visibility and detection coverage

114
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,290
is the way I used it it runs via Python

115
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,389
3 so it takes yamo files that you fill

116
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,710
out and then plumps out the json files

117
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:38,990
that the attack navigator uploads so

118
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,239
pretty easy to use has an interactive

119
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,690
mode can run through some commands fun

120
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,820
simple so the way I used it is there's

121
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,520
two data files on there that are both

122
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,039
gamal one is data sources and the other

123
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,799
is the administrator techniques file so

124
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,800
the data sources is pretty much what

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,990
you're logging right there's 64 great

126
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,020
importance on this and they're judging

127
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,000
device completeness timeliness

128
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,000
consistency and retention so they have

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,500
grading already set up for you but you

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,510
don't necessarily have to use their

131
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,210
grading you can just make up your own so

132
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,860
here is an example of the gradient on

133
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,080
the right hand side so for a good

134
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,919
example file monitoring right so I put

135
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,990
in the products

136
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,349
do I have analytics for it and then my

137
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,300
grades this probably was the hardest

138
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,550
part of doing all this just because I

139
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,160
got my team together emailed them all

140
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,229
this EML file and of course none of them

141
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,970
emailed me back so then I had to tell

142
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,800
them to email me and then when I only

143
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,270
got one back and then that one person

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,610
sent me bracket broken the ammo file

145
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,169
which then turned into a headache so I

146
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,970
if you're gonna do this I would suggest

147
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,889
maybe printing this out or actually

148
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,810
doing an NT meeting and then discussing

149
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:49,729
it this also brings up a lot of

150
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,310
questions on what your login is and how

151
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,180
you feel how good it is right works out

152
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,250
really well

153
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,560
once you've finished that llamó file you

154
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,030
pump it into detect and it gives you the

155
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,010
JSON file that's thrown to attack

156
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,419
looks something like this so the legend

157
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,400
in the bottom right-hand corner shows

158
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,310
you that the darker purple is what I'm

159
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,020
logging somewhat decent to what I'm not

160
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,910
logging great to white where you're not

161
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,560
logging anything in that at all I

162
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,180
thought this was amazing right off the

163
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,750
bat I know what I'm logging I know where

164
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,810
I can build those alerts out and I also

165
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,190
if you go to the next one can give me it

166
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,610
also gives me a little bit of metadata

167
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,950
on that so the product on what slot what

168
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,320
can log that a little bit of the

169
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,719
monitoring that type of stuff works out

170
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,909
great so that second file is the

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,240
detection file so I use the detection

172
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,310
file in order to put on to put verified

173
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,710
alerts that I've written that I know

174
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,500
that I'm logging so this first example

175
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:48,409
is the side binary sign binary proxy

176
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,150
execution which is a excellent example

177
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,850
because there's a million alerts I could

178
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,890
write for this so if you see down in the

179
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,230
comments I actually have the alert names

180
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,510
written down I have the date which is

181
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,550
important and I have my confidence which

182
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,710
is my score and that alert and then also

183
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,120
the location which is in my EDR they

184
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,159
have their grading the same thing you

185
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,220
can use it or you can just make up your

186
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,500
own high I'm not going after you pump

187
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,050
that through detect it pumps out that

188
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,570
JSON file again which gives you this on

189
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,130
a one to five shows you what you think

190
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,900
you're good at detecting with the blue

191
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,360
is what you're detecting and you have

192
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,039
zero on and then white is maybe you're

193
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,130
logging but you don't detect it

194
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,080
necessarily so it does the same similar

195
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,300
thing as the last file is the data

196
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,340
source file and it gives you notes so

197
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,130
you can see who it's applicable to what

198
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,989
your score is and then maybe where that

199
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,730
alert is located and then some technical

200
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,280
comments if you have them which is

201
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,810
really nice the next big thing was how

202
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,640
do I get those files together and what's

203
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,650
nice is detect will actually layer those

204
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,930
files for you which looks something like

205
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,510
this so the blue is what I have

206
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,460
visibility in the and the orange is what

207
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,080
I have visibility in and detecting and

208
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,380
the white is where I don't have anything

209
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,419
in right so in this example I have a lot

210
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,219
of room to make up to start building out

211
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,740
or at least verifying alerts within

212
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,290
those blue entities and another big

213
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,520
thing that detect does is if you guys

214
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,470
remember how I said it was important to

215
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,990
put those dates in the alerts

216
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:18,040
it also gives you a graph on how you're

217
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,560
improving so the reason I love this is

218
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,900
managers and VPS or whatever love to see

219
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,060
graphs and loves to see improvement so

220
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,979
being able to show them hey this is what

221
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,620
we're logging and detecting and this is

222
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,330
our improvement they go off the walls

223
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,640
for it one thing to keep in mind is this

224
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,800
graph is based on a mitre attacks and

225
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,780
not necessarily alerts you written so

226
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,929
for example this may cover 25 different

227
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,669
mitre attacks but you've may have

228
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,829
written around 50 alerts for this which

229
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,240
definitely happens so the next thing

230
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:51,410
that it also does is it does a little

231
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,150
bit of stuff with apt groups and pushing

232
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,160
them all together so here's a heat map

233
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,900
of actually all the Iranian attacks from

234
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,880
before so what I did is I did some

235
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,069
threat reconnaissance on all the Iranian

236
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,070
groups push them together into a single

237
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,450
file using detect and then it gave me

238
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,520
this heat map on the attacks they're

239
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,870
most likely to use are most known to use

240
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,720
right you want to take it with a grain

241
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,850
of salt really good if if you can do

242
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,850
this which is layering those attacks on

243
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,310
top of your detection right so on this

244
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,870
the green is what I'm detecting the

245
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,449
yellow is what I'm logging and not

246
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,610
detecting and the red is what they're

247
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,040
using I'm sorry the green is what

248
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,170
they're using and what I'm detecting

249
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,209
that's what it was I've totally forgot

250
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,010
to put the legend in this one so it also

251
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,020
gives you that same scoring over there

252
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,780
this is excellent for a gap analysis

253
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,550
based on apt groups I used this when

254
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,230
Iranian when Iran popped off and

255
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,910
everyone's all big and scared and so I

256
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,240
showed my boss like hey here's where

257
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,459
we're at

258
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,320
here's what Ron does we're pretty

259
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,230
covered the next big thing how I said

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,750
how usually managers love to see these

261
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,700
graphs right so uh one I did help the

262
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,130
help a couple buddies set this up and

263
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,990
one thing you can tell is like how

264
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,810
sparse this graph is and this was his

265
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,820
graph and so he went to his VP and said

266
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,290
hey man like here's all my attack purple

267
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,450
is what we're detecting the white is

268
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,270
what we're not detecting if we were to

269
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:13,940
get tool X tool and Y tool we'd be able

270
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,650
to cover this which then starts a

271
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,530
conversation on how much they're missing

272
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,910
and the risk that they're really the

273
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,730
risk that they have for not having the

274
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,650
correct tools so this all leads me back

275
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,360
to the detections right if you're

276
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,040
logging fine but

277
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,740
how are you sure that you're actually

278
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,439
detecting what your detection file was

279
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,440
written so I used atomic read team in

280
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,570
order to verify all those detection that

281
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,579
I wrote in the detection file atomic

282
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,040
read team super easy to use right

283
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:45,790
develop I read canary it's organized by

284
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,610
attack ID the best part is its

285
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:52,219
automatable automatable yeah so it has a

286
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,740
power shell at Ruby and Python the right

287
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,750
hand side is actually a copy of what the

288
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,120
automated Python is you just give it a

289
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,760
attack so in this example it's remote

290
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,769
file copy and then you can choose which

291
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,410
to which type of remote file copy attack

292
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:08,149
you can have it run one thing I really

293
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,339
like to do though is using the left hand

294
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:12,560
side is the ammo file that the

295
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:15,500
automation is using I tried to run all

296
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,660
the attacks by hand myself just so I can

297
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,630
understand how they actually work and

298
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,329
perform and if there is any difficulties

299
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,160
on my system actually me running them it

300
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:28,880
worked out really well I actually

301
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,969
learned a lot on both sides so the only

302
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,410
other really stuff I have to say is

303
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:37,190
automation wise I'm trying to build some

304
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,410
tools that go into all of my security

305
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,839
vendor tools and pull out the alerts I

306
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,480
renamed all of my alerts and everything

307
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,930
on mitre attack framework so having that

308
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,480
T whatever indicator in my alert rules

309
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,370
so for example right now I have a script

310
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,070
that goes through my EDR reads all the

311
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,410
alerts and then edits that detection

312
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,019
file and updates it for me so now I

313
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,850
don't even have to edit the files it'll

314
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,829
just automatically update I have a

315
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,690
couple other automation ideas but I

316
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:08,180
haven't really had them go all the way

317
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,890
through and that's it thank you guys I

318
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,890
like to give a big shout out to the guys

319
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,439
who made detect which is Marcus Baker

320
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,750
and Ruben Baumann they they're on

321
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,370
Twitter there I hit him up a little bit

322
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,320
and said their tool is awesome big

323
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,720
thanks to red canary and miter attack

324
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,240
and I'll also like to say one good

325
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,220
thanks to Jon Hamm because he actually

326
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,260
gave me this idea a little bit he

327
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,230
sparked the flame when I was in his five

328
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,089
eleven sans class and that's it oh I

329
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,339
know it was really quick I'm sorry I

330
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,199
wasn't sure if I was gonna make it so I

331
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,250
got a couple questions for you how long

332
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:42,949
did it take you

333
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,500
tie all this together surprisingly this

334
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:48,050
probably took me like a month oh god

335
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,300
yeah the hardest thing to really do was

336
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,670
fill out the Gamo file everything else

337
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,859
was pretty easy odd there's a couple big

338
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,479
things I forgot about the the mitre

339
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,340
attack Navigator so running that

340
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,380
yourself it can run in a free ec2

341
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,170
instance that's what I run all of this

342
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,300
in or you can use theirs what's nice is

343
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,160
the attack Navigator is actually runs in

344
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,099
an iframe and you can embed it into

345
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,319
whatever so instead of having my 11

346
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,630
confluence pages I embedded that attack

347
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,880
then that mitre attack Navigator into

348
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,380
the page so another question I have

349
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,860
whenever you're having whenever you

350
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,890
identify areas where you are a little

351
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,570
bit deficient are you using Sigma to try

352
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,340
to generate those signatures to fill

353
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,590
those gaps so it's more portable across

354
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,990
some platforms or are you writing like

355
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,660
signatures specifically for like Splunk

356
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,240
or whatever sim platform you use so

357
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,640
right now I'm not using Sigma n e more

358
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,950
just because it was that was the

359
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,530
heaviest part when I originally tried to

360
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:48,860
do it usually a majority of these alerts

361
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,810
I'm using the detectives in my EDR so

362
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,550
I'm going to need er alerts there's a

363
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,069
couple that I can write and Splunk and I

364
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,770
go back and forth but I usually don't

365
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,330
write in Sigma anymore okay now that's

366
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,730
just big oh is that because Sigma

367
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,440
doesn't support the flexibility and the

368
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:07,580
syntax that you would get directly and

369
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,420
Splunk correct so like I think the

370
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:13,880
syntax for my EDR wasn't in Sigma at the

371
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,770
time I was using it and so I was like if

372
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,320
I'm gonna write it in Sigma it's only

373
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,240
gonna be good for my sim and not my EDR

374
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,339
so there's no point at the moment what

375
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,350
was interesting though was going I would

376
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:27,920
go through Sigma and read the alerts and

377
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,720
then convert those to my EDR okay then

378
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,280
jump McJunkin asked a question he said

379
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,990
how long would it take for you to do

380
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,850
this in another company if you tried to

381
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,280
do this again since it took you a month

382
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,700
you you kind of banged your head on some

383
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,770
walls

384
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,800
how fast were to be wound up again

385
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:45,199
before I worked so to give you I work in

386
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,510
a very small team in and in the FinTech

387
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,160
and beforehand I worked at a managed

388
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,450
security provider and I the first thing

389
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,959
I thought is like man people should do

390
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,750
this as a service

391
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,760
but I think it was as long as you guys

392
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,780
had that yam will filled out it would

393
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,450
take me a day

394
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,010
the gamble think the gamble knowing what

395
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,320
you're logging and you grading your

396
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,660
logging is the hardest part yeah it

397
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,180
seems it's kind of subjective a little

398
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,819
bit like you got a properly

399
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,920
definitely and that's why so that's why

400
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,170
you should probably should use their

401
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,420
their grading rubric just so you

402
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,250
understand a little bit I'd say the

403
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,469
other harder part is testing all the

404
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,120
alerts in red canary because sometimes

405
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,290
you'll test one and it doesn't work and

406
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,390
you'll have to figure it out or you'll

407
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,980
have to write a new alert or a little

408
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,610
bit that's more of like the constant

409
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,380
improvement area it's home I love this

410
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,630
Jeff decide this is the one time I'm

411
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,160
gonna say Jeff uh I'm gonna disagree

412
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,720
with Jeff Jeff said sounds like you

413
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,250
should fire all the atomic red team

414
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,620
things at once and see what's being

415
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,840
monitored traditionally I've had trouble

416
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,790
with atomic red team firing absolutely

417
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,500
everything it's better to take it in

418
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,380
small discrete sections but I think the

419
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,820
idea is sound right fire it off stimulus

420
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,070
and then see the response back on the

421
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,690
logs correct usually what I would do is

422
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,210
write when I get into work I would fire

423
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,130
off maybe two or three and then come

424
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,140
back to it later in the day and see okay

425
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,550
what did I see I tried to use a couple

426
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,500
other red team tools that called air and

427
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,990
stuff but I kept going back to atomic

428
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,510
red team just because of the simplicity

429
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,880
around it so like everything everything

430
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:17,340
here is like a github poll that I just

431
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,760
pulled down and I felt like atomic

432
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:26,460
retina is easier than caldera on see

433
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:28,290
goes no no I absolutely agree and I

434
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,120
think that that would be the the kind of

435
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,000
a Holy Grail is if you could fire off

436
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,290
like atomic red team and haven't go all

437
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,020
the way through and then have something

438
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,030
like detect say okay you ran this here's

439
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,380
what I was able to see in the logs that

440
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,290
would be just awesome

441
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,740
so but time right only so much time

442
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,360
exactly it worked really well for only

443
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,400
having a couple people I couldn't

444
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,230
imagine if like a large enterprise had

445
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,480
this and tried to like actively use it

446
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,130
all the time it's um I also really liked

447
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,920
it just because a threat Intel part

448
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,780
right so I'll do all my due diligence

449
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,329
and then be able to show us like how

450
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,579
we're doing against us but you know

451
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:07,079
I think that especially like as much as

452
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,779
I had this eating hatred for threat

453
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,639
intelligence being able to answer the

454
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,529
question to management like oh my god

455
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,449
these Iranians are hacking us are we

456
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:17,490
ready just to be able to show yep we've

457
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,049
got this covered I think giving them

458
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,059
some level of peace of mind that you're

459
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:22,559
you're not incompetent is a very good

460
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,029
thing and then final question would you

461
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,799
be willing to come back and do a webcast

462
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:29,120
for Black Hills information security

463
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:32,460
slower over an hour on this topic

464
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,059
absolutely okay very cool we'll hit up

465
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,250
Jason oh cool I would love to do that it

466
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,320
would make my ear just being here

467
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,019
reading this doing this made my ear and

468
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,510
then meeting I met you at a besides in

469
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,510
San Diego that was a big deal
