1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,600
let me go ahead and introduce Dan

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,400
declass the CEO and founder of Plex

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,140
track plexrax is one of the sponsors and

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,599
they've got a great Booth over there

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,160
secure ideas use them for a while great

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,320
program strongly recommend Dan's going

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,700
to be talking to us I honestly don't

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,960
remember are we really making a

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,180
difference Dana it's all you all right

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,279
thanks everybody and thanks for uh

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,260
thanks for getting up early on uh Friday

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,260
morning here Way West in San Diego and

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,539
thanks everybody to zoom that's uh

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,060
that's joined us online so uh I'm gonna

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,500
make this the shortest presentation ever

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,300
you know we were joking last night hey

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,980
should we just answer the question now

18
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,840
and then get 49 minutes back right like

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,760
let's just say hey maybe

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,160
so no I'm just kidding like that's not

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,140
the that's not the agenda for today and

22
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,239
I realize that as I converted this

23
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,340
there's a little bit of a typo here but

24
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,559
um so uh the agendas just kind of

25
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,600
introduce uh some stuff that I've been

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,160
pondering on over the last several years

27
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,719
uh and wanted to kind of put it together

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,940
in a presentation uh things that I've

29
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,219
observed in the industry and and as as

30
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,500
we come together as an industry uh so

31
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,579
kind of want to talk about like hey

32
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,199
what's the problem I always try to

33
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,659
approach things in security about what

34
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,280
problem are we trying to solve right and

35
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,500
approach it from a programmatic

36
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,420
perspective

37
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,479
kind of do some introspection as a as a

38
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,340
as an industry of how we're doing how

39
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,740
are we making progress and uh how will

40
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,180
we get better how we how will we

41
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,979
continue to get better as as time goes

42
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,960
on and then I'd like to open it up for

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,100
thoughts and discussion I think it's

44
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,500
kind of an interesting an interesting

45
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,840
discussion for sure

46
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,640
um but so to start I think it's

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,759
important to kind of tell my story as to

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,579
you know why why I've been getting

49
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,460
getting to this perspective right so uh

50
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,400
so I started in in cyber security I've

51
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,920
been in cyber security my entire career

52
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,540
I went to the naval post graduate school

53
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,020
and uh was accepted into their program

54
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,460
called the scholarship for service

55
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,720
program back in 2005 and I was really

56
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,340
excited I've always been kind of a

57
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,460
mission oriented person right so so I

58
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,340
felt like hey I am I'm I am destined for

59
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,538
this I'm going to come in and just be a

60
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,900
superhero in the security industry I I

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,340
found a calling and I'm going to be able

62
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,920
to like make a difference in the world

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,720
and so I I loved going to graduate

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,860
school

65
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,540
I started my career in the Department of

66
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,420
Defense and was like yes this is this is

67
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,700
what I'm I'm made to do right and so I

68
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,940
was very uh very excited about you know

69
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,680
actually making a difference in in

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,959
society and in the world

71
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,319
um as as I started my career I started

72
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,879
to get exposed to everything that's

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,860
that's going on and I then kind of

74
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,500
turned into this uh this sense of dread

75
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
like oh my goodness there are uh there's

76
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,760
a whole new world out there and there's

77
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,220
a lot of problems

78
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,900
and things that I didn't recognize that

79
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,599
we couldn't solve right so I went

80
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,920
through this period of like oh my

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,140
goodness how do we how are we ever gonna

82
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,819
make a difference how are we ever going

83
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,239
to get ahead in the security space

84
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,519
um so that this period of kind time took

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,200
me into like okay what are the things I

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,780
can focus on so I I started I actually

87
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,580
found my niche in penetration testing

88
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,080
specifically in application security

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,000
penetration testing

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,620
um and that you know led me on a journey

91
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,440
to start identifying things that I was

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,540
really uh frustrated about in the in the

93
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,760
security space one thing that I hated

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,580
the most was I would come back and maybe

95
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,739
some in this audience have experienced

96
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,560
this probably have a lot I hated coming

97
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,200
back to the same customer or the same

98
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,840
client a year year after year after year

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,239
and Reporting the same things that we

100
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,459
had found previous years right and it's

101
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,260
like when will you ever listen I like

102
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,200
when I was in the dod we would do a lot

103
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,080
of compliance testing right so it wasn't

104
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,700
necessarily penetration testing it was

105
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,140
more just like vulnerability scanning

106
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,180
and we provide these reports these were

107
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,040
big organizations

108
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,799
had lots of IP addresses and assets so

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,959
we would we would do a sampling right

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,420
like anybody like

111
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,799
statistically it's like okay give me a

112
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,659
sampling of your when this is back in

113
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,980
the day so like give me a sampling of

114
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,659
your Windows 2008 servers give me a

115
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,159
sampling of your workstations those

116
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,980
kinds of things network devices so we we

117
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,780
would extrapolate hey we tested 10

118
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,238
percent of the environment so we would

119
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,399
assume that of the vulnerabilities we

120
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,779
found within that ten percent just

121
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,940
extrapolate that to the hole and go fix

122
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,100
the hole but instead of instead of

123
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,720
fixing the entire organization they'd

124
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,639
only fix what we reported right so it

125
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,020
got very frustrating because we tried to

126
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,520
communicate like no this is just a

127
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,680
sampling right you should go fix

128
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,479
everything you should you should explore

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,400
everything we don't have time in one

130
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,220
week to to assess the entire environment

131
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,060
that way and so there was a there was a

132
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,919
breakdown in communication a breakdown

133
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,660
and follow through

134
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,660
uh as I progressed into uh you know the

135
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,660
private sector would would recognize

136
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,220
obviously that people are just checking

137
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,900
a box sometimes

138
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,440
um but I hated I just I I loathed not

139
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,639
feeling like I was making a difference

140
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,460
not feeling like hey after I report

141
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,440
something how do we actually get this

142
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,000
fixed and how do we actually show that

143
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,160
we're moving forward and that actually

144
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,199
that was actually a large motivation for

145
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,840
why I started Plex track this is not a

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,400
vendor pitch or anything like that but

147
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,900
the I think it's important to kind of

148
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,000
put the perspective of I really became

149
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,340
determined like I actually want to try

150
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,440
and make a difference and I want to

151
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,240
provide a way for people to focus on the

152
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,900
right things and be able to uh

153
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,660
show progress over time and actually get

154
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,580
better at security and how do we as an

155
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,800
industry come together and stay focused

156
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,380
on the things that matter and not

157
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,600
focused on you know menial things like

158
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,240
copying and pasting into Word documents

159
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,280
and resizing screenshots and things like

160
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,900
this and so that was really the impetus

161
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,060
for for how we got to where I am today

162
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,600
but uh you know and by no means have I

163
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,120
felt like we've made uh progress but I

164
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,919
think well we've made progress but by no

165
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,300
means do I feel like we've accomplished

166
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,020
what we've set out to do right and so

167
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,820
this has kind of been my journey and

168
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,440
things that I've just started to observe

169
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,500
over the last 17 plus years

170
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,560
um and I'm excited to be involved in the

171
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,020
community by no means do I feel like I

172
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,600
have the only perspective obviously but

173
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,940
it's it's exciting to me to at least be

174
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,620
at a state in this in the security space

175
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,000
where we can actually continue to

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,100
collaborate on what are we what are we

177
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,860
focused on what should we be focused on

178
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,180
so I always like to kind of start out

179
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,639
like what is the problem right I think

180
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,699
there's it's easy to to focus on a lot

181
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,919
of different things but sometimes I

182
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,240
think that in the security industry

183
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,460
we're our own worst enemies right I

184
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,400
think that we tend to get caught up on a

185
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,259
lot of technical things and not

186
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,940
recognizing why we're doing what we're

187
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,280
doing

188
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,139
what I like to say we have a lack of

189
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,740
focus on the right problems right

190
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,080
in in security what is the ultimate goal

191
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,780
and are we asking the right questions we

192
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,600
get decent I think as a as a as a

193
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,240
society and General now you know

194
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,280
starting my career early on we were

195
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,300
always trying to convince people like

196
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,819
hey the bad things can happen and then

197
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,440
they happened and now we're trying to to

198
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,060
convince people why it's important to

199
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,860
actually fix the things that are going

200
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,840
on I think we've been a little bit

201
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,479
desensitized to breaches and leaks as a

202
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,360
society which makes it even harder I

203
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,160
think from our industry perspective of

204
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,199
Are We focused on fixing these things

205
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,720
and what should we be focused on in in

206
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
terms of getting people better

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,300
so uh what I what I think is hard is to

208
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,800
determine what are the long-term effects

209
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,080
of a breach right for some for smaller

210
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,080
organizations and and startups and small

211
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,940
businesses a breach can be devastating

212
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,940
right for larger organizations it's

213
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,460
certainly a black eye the first breach

214
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,680
probably isn't gonna isn't isn't going

215
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,440
to ruin them multiple breaches is might

216
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,500
but as as we've seen over time companies

217
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,780
like Target and Home Depot and Anthem

218
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,039
Blue Cross I mean they're still doing

219
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,960
fine right and these are some of the

220
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,080
largest breaches in their eras right so

221
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,180
it's it's hard it's hard and difficult

222
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,800
to see what the actual impact of a

223
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,560
breach has been over time and so then it

224
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,900
leads to the question well does does it

225
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,280
make a difference are we does it matter

226
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,419
what we're doing

227
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,520
uh

228
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,400
so I think that that's that's kind of

229
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,900
the point of what we're trying to focus

230
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,300
on today is what what is the problem

231
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,160
that we're trying to solve and are we

232
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,360
making a difference and are we making

233
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,520
progress and where the where are the

234
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,200
short shortcomings and what can we do to

235
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
fix those so when I think about my time

236
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,580
in cyber security and I'm sure you can

237
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,440
feel the same way it definitely starts

238
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,719
to feel overwhelming right from a ciso

239
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,399
perspective this is the ciso Mind map

240
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,160
that I think is is not meant to be read

241
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,680
just visualized right these are all the

242
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,680
things that a ciso would have under his

243
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,899
or her purview when they're building out

244
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,940
a cyber security program right it

245
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,620
doesn't matter how big the organization

246
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,779
is these are the topics that come and

247
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,940
they get inundated with regardless of

248
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,800
what size of an organization you are or

249
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,740
a size of a team that you're building I

250
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,420
think we are inundated with buzzwords in

251
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,220
the in the industry

252
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,959
um people get inundated with alerts

253
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
uh you know there's lots of tooling

254
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
which I have another slide here to kind

255
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,839
of visualize that as well

256
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,240
um vendors that you know I think the

257
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,100
good and the bad about where we've made

258
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,920
progress in the security space is that

259
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,580
um

260
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,860
there's a lot of investment now in cyber

261
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,920
security and and I think Haroon Mir has

262
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,320
a great perspective of like hey we need

263
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,000
to we need to be careful about the snake

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,580
oil versus the actual progress and

265
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,779
tooling that is actually going to make

266
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,660
us better so that's the that's the

267
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,160
downside of having a lot of investment

268
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,140
in cyber in cyber security today the

269
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,700
good side is that we actually have

270
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,160
investment to actually solve some of the

271
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,380
harder problems that that take time and

272
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,000
take money

273
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,700
um and then we get we get it people get

274
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,200
inundated with should I have

275
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
certifications I read I read a LinkedIn

276
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,100
post just uh yesterday that there's

277
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,860
something like over like 300 security

278
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,920
certifications available to Industry

279
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,620
professionals today and all I mean most

280
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,899
of them are paid right so so the

281
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,700
security certification industry is is

282
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,140
making a lot of money off of people

283
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,420
trying to get into security and is that

284
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,180
making a difference or not so there's

285
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,800
there's definitely this sense of being

286
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,300
overwhelmed if you're on the blue team

287
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,440
right or or an in internal red team

288
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,019
lots of things to focus on lots of

289
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,500
distraction and and this sense of where

290
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,420
should I start or how how do I know if

291
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,420
I'm making progress in in anything

292
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,920
another example is here's the momentum

293
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,800
cyber cyber landscape this is this

294
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,300
doesn't actually include all the

295
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,100
solutions that exist for all of these

296
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,860
different types of of uh problems right

297
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,899
or you know what vendors tell us we have

298
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,540
problems for right so this is this is a

299
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,160
list of like as many companies as you

300
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,300
can think of for each type of domain

301
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,800
and I know that not every company is

302
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,339
listed here right so when we have to

303
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,920
remain focused on a lot of these it

304
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,600
starts to detract us from what what

305
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,660
problems we're actually trying to solve

306
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,500
so when we talk about how are we doing

307
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,180
I kind of want to start backwards you

308
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,380
know typically you start like the good

309
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,880
the bad the ugly I'm going to go from

310
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,500
the ugly the bad the good because I like

311
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,779
to end with good things

312
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:28,560
um

313
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,380
my perspective right and I think um I

314
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,720
actually put out a poll uh on on social

315
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,880
media that I've got all the results for

316
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,980
we will read through them all but I

317
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,360
wanted to have them in the deck so that

318
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,820
you know they could the as we distribute

319
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,260
the slides we can put them out there as

320
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,420
well but

321
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,860
here's some things that I think are

322
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,620
wrong in the security space both the

323
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,600
ugly and the bad right I think there are

324
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,640
definitely a lot of egos in the security

325
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,920
space not everybody uh and and

326
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,240
definitely I don't think in In This

327
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,860
Crowd I think that this is what the why

328
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,560
was hacking Fest crowd specifically is

329
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,240
um

330
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,339
void of egos for the most part

331
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,320
um but this has been a detriment over

332
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,079
time right it has it has deterred people

333
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
that are very smart to actually get into

334
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,399
the space and try to solve the hard

335
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,920
problems and that leads to exclusivity

336
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,620
right you do have a mentality of hey I

337
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,279
was at Defcon one or I was at Defcon six

338
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,980
and uh you know uh you know I I have I

339
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,260
have just a a different error about me

340
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,700
and I'm not saying I mean personally

341
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,560
this is how I've seen people behave

342
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,420
because I wasn't at Defcon 6.

343
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,700
um uh there's this sense of like well

344
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,200
you know I was there from the beginning

345
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
and I I know a lot more than everybody

346
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,620
else right so

347
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,480
um I'm just gonna you know do my own

348
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,639
thing and look and really treat people

349
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,380
with contempt and I've had it done to

350
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,120
myself I'm sure a lot of other people

351
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,700
have as well and I think there's one

352
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,220
thing that's true about technologists in

353
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,360
general but definitely in the security

354
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,579
space is that we tend to have imposter

355
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,620
syndrome right we tend to not feel

356
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,959
confident in the the things that we know

357
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,700
and the things we can do and that's to

358
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,160
our detriment as an industry

359
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,779
there's definitely a lack of empathy

360
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,480
when we talk about you know red teaming

361
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,459
or penetration testing or the offensive

362
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,440
side of security that's definitely

363
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,240
there's definitely a lack of empathy

364
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,399
that I've seen over the years for The

365
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,260
Blue Team side right if you've not been

366
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,180
on a blue team I definitely encourage

367
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,120
you to try it because there is so much

368
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,920
else going on within a single

369
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,019
organization that it's hard to it's hard

370
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,940
to recognize all the challenges that a

371
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,980
blue team is facing outside of the

372
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,620
technical vulnerabilities and and risks

373
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,540
that are getting reported to them right

374
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,480
things like political structure within

375
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,920
the organization

376
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,000
people problems all kinds of of other

377
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,639
things going on in their daily work that

378
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,100
distract them from being able to focus

379
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,860
on security risks and vulnerabilities

380
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,959
and then then a couple things that have

381
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,899
I think been highlighted more recently

382
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,000
that I think is really important and I I

383
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,160
wanted to make sure I had a pause for

384
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,660
this I think we do tend to put our

385
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,880
identity as who we are as people and

386
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,120
individuals into our work

387
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,700
Debbie this is common amongst all humans

388
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,160
I think but uh you know specifically in

389
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,160
this space I think mental health is

390
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,720
becoming a problem right and I think

391
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
it's been talked about before uh and and

392
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,220
I I mean I'm not going to speak for

393
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,899
everybody and I think everybody's going

394
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,700
to have their own opinions on this but I

395
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,680
do think that some of that stems from

396
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,620
putting our identity into our jobs and

397
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,820
not the relationships that we're

398
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,860
building throughout society and and

399
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,560
throughout our work which can lead to

400
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,779
which can lead to mental health problems

401
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,240
not I'm just saying I'm just recognizing

402
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,680
there is a problem there I'm not going

403
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,839
to State everybody's that this is a

404
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,760
global thing or this is how it this is

405
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,199
how we solve it I just think that it's

406
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,699
important for us as an industry to

407
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,459
recognize that uh we should reach out to

408
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,139
friends right and and colleagues and

409
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,240
just ask how they're doing right outside

410
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,560
of work

411
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,899
um so this is some of the ugly stuff and

412
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,699
I think we've seen we've lost a lot of

413
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,279
people in the space due to mental health

414
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,360
issues and and so it is a problem right

415
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,860
um so going from the ugly to the bad

416
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,959
these are kind of more tactical things I

417
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,820
think definitely within organizations we

418
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,220
have a lack of stakeholder support

419
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,620
there's little to no collaboration

420
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,079
sometimes between people that are on the

421
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,639
proactive side of security and the

422
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,079
people that are on the defensive side of

423
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,860
security uh it's a lot it can be very

424
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,300
confusing and overwhelming for blue

425
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,060
teams to get to get inundated with a 300

426
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,399
page pen test report or you know a

427
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,139
vulnerability scan that has a thousand

428
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,940
findings and how am I supposed to know

429
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,620
what to do with this right and who's

430
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,100
going to help me figure this out uh and

431
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,139
so there's this lack of Education in

432
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,959
general between the the different teams

433
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,940
that are identifying the issues and the

434
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,339
teams that are are tasked to go resolve

435
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,019
the issues as well as be able to

436
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,480
communicate up the chain right so I

437
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,339
think that communication is a big factor

438
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,800
in how how we move forward as an

439
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,680
industry being able to communicate

440
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,060
clearly what are the risks and what is

441
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,740
the impact to the business is always

442
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,440
very important um foreign

443
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,720
we're definitely more reactive than

444
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,779
proactive as as an industry especially

445
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,579
on the blue team side I think you know

446
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:18,959
when we talk about penetration testing

447
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,320
that's a very proactive activity but for

448
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,660
the most part on The Blue Team they're

449
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,220
they're starting their organization

450
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,199
they're starting their program with a

451
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,300
Sim they're starting how to identify

452
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,760
alerts and then they spend 90 percent of

453
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,220
their time one keeping the Sim up and

454
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,339
running or configuring it and to you

455
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,620
know trying to just reduce the amount

456
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,360
alerts that are coming into into an

457
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,420
organization so that's not a that's not

458
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,160
a very proactive activity it's a very

459
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,380
reactive activity when I was a security

460
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,600
director I tried to actually allocate

461
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,880
hey 70 of our time for now as we're

462
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,139
getting started we're going to spend on

463
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,380
reactive processes reactive things and

464
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,360
and more Legacy issues but then we're

465
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,740
going to spend the other 30 percent of

466
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,720
our time focused on proactive activities

467
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,359
how do we make sure we're avoiding some

468
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,619
of these things before they become

469
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,839
Legacy issues

470
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,280
and then other things like you know

471
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,079
simple things like unicorn job

472
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,179
descriptions right you will see we see

473
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,299
we see uh organizations putting out job

474
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,760
descriptions for entry-level uh security

475
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,819
uh jobs that require a cissp or five

476
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,740
years of experience and and that's

477
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,660
that's becoming a detriment to how we

478
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,160
make progress and get more people into

479
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,520
the space and into security as well so

480
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,780
this is these are some of the things

481
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,940
that I recognize uh you know are not new

482
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,740
to anybody but I think it's important to

483
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,360
continue to call them out as we as we

484
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,440
move forward

485
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,260
some other things as well

486
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,539
we tend to get caught up in Petty

487
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,880
arguments you know college versus no

488
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,580
college degree

489
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,480
certifications how many should I have

490
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,320
which ones should I have uh you know I

491
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,480
like this one because I may I may get

492
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,620
thrown off the stage but like what is

493
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,360
the definition of red teaming I think I

494
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,160
think okay that's that's fine let's have

495
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,539
that discussion but is it really worth

496
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,360
our time to discuss you know what what a

497
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,880
red team engagement is versus a pen test

498
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,620
and and all these things and it's like

499
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,419
that's fine to have a healthy

500
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,400
conversation about it but let's not get

501
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,840
wrapped around the axle about these

502
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,179
things right

503
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,760
um and I think we do tend to as an or as

504
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,880
a society as an industry put ourselves

505
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,340
into silos the hackers definitely get

506
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,559
glorified the pen testing side of the

507
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,440
house definitely tends to get exalted

508
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,580
and you know and then there's everybody

509
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,919
else right there's the identity

510
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,919
management folks there's the there's the

511
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,660
sock and there's you know the role

512
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,860
management folks it was the app stick

513
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,320
folks there's a lot of work going on in

514
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,700
the security space that is not

515
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,440
penetration testing and red teaming

516
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,539
right and if I think that's if there's

517
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,740
one thing you want to take away from

518
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,419
this is that those people are working

519
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,480
very hard and have a lot of issues to

520
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,820
resolve you know and and are overwhelmed

521
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,640
at times right so I think it's important

522
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,140
that we we at least stay focused on the

523
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,640
right things and let's not get wrapped

524
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,640
around the axle of arguments and

525
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,500
discussions that that don't move the

526
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,940
needle forward in insecurity

527
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,539
um okay so like you know how do I think

528
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,520
we're doing in terms of the good I think

529
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,679
we're definitely maturing rapidly as an

530
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,260
industry uh from an industry perspective

531
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,820
we're very immature

532
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,880
um in general right uh probably you know

533
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,179
realistically 20 to 30 years worth of of

534
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,919
growth in the space is not that long

535
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,600
when you think about other Industries

536
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,419
like find the financial sector

537
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,400
um the legal sector there's there's lots

538
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,380
of time that has been to mature how you

539
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,960
how you observe the growth and the and

540
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,760
the risks associated with each industry

541
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,280
so I think we have are rapidly maturing

542
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,260
right which is good and bad

543
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,160
um

544
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,520
the the amount of of transformation and

545
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,500
technology that has grown over the last

546
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,419
20 years is is really impressive and

547
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,640
we're solving quick problems in a good

548
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,140
way

549
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,940
um I think we are doing better at

550
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,100
proliferating knowledge of what we do as

551
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,620
an industry and how we get uh how we get

552
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,260
that knowledge disseminated to people

553
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,600
that are not in our organization I think

554
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,240
early on everybody was very tight-lipped

555
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,580
about techniques and things that they're

556
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,080
doing their organization to solve

557
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,820
problems and I think we've made a we've

558
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,200
made good progress there in terms of

559
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,940
being able to share that information

560
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,940
without disclosing confidentiality or

561
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,220
you know breaking confidentiality and

562
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,860
privacy

563
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,299
I think we We are continuing to

564
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,640
collaborate for the future how do we

565
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,320
continue to get better as an industry as

566
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,320
a whole as a as a quote-unquote larger

567
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,360
purple team so to speak

568
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,679
um and we're solving challenging

569
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,480
problems these are not easy problems to

570
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,059
solve how do you how do you prevent you

571
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,580
know continued exploits that are that

572
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,080
are does that be

573
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,870
sorry there's a

574
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,380
[Laughter]

575
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,000
didn't know if I stepped somewhere that

576
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,620
I always shouldn't have stepped

577
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,780
uh you know and I think I think one

578
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,220
thing this is this is really exciting to

579
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,320
me is that I think that the people that

580
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,360
get into security and stay in security

581
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,580
are very Mission oriented because it is

582
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,620
a challenging it is challenging job

583
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,980
right and uh I think the folks that that

584
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,860
tend to stay in the industry truly have

585
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,559
the right motivation uh it's not always

586
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,539
about them and about you know their

587
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,400
progress in their career but truly

588
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,780
trying to make a difference in the world

589
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,000
uh and it's this is the way that we can

590
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,640
do it so those are some things that I I

591
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,799
have recognized are very good about the

592
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,659
progress that we're making that we've

593
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,880
made over the last 17 years that I've

594
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,919
I've been in the space

595
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,380
so I kind of mentioned that uh that I

596
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,580
put out a little bit of poll because

597
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,200
like these these are my this is my

598
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,360
perspective having been in the space and

599
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,700
and to talk to a lot of people and and

600
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,559
had multiple roles because I've been in

601
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,960
both sides of the fence in terms of

602
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,179
um the red team side and the blue team

603
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,580
side uh so but I wanted to kind of see

604
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,260
like okay you know we see a lot of these

605
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,940
discussions online but like I just put

606
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,380
out a random poll earlier in the week

607
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,880
just to kind of see what other people

608
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,559
think so I just said hey I'm just

609
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,299
getting some feedback you know what are

610
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,740
the things that you love about the

611
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,840
industry or and and one of the things

612
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,760
that annoy you about the industry I put

613
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,380
this out on Twitter LinkedIn Twitter

614
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,840
tends to get a little bit you know more

615
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,940
uh response

616
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,700
um and so it was it was assuring and and

617
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,740
concerning all the same time right so I

618
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,460
think

619
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,200
um anytime people are going to respond

620
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,039
to something like this they're always

621
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,200
going to kind of lean towards the

622
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,520
negative it's like when you put out a

623
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,780
survey for like hey how are we doing

624
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,700
most people that are happy are not going

625
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,980
to like respond and the people that that

626
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,860
aren't happy or are going to tend to um

627
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,700
make a comment right so so I I we won't

628
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,919
read through all of these but I I

629
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,539
highlighted some of the good ones that I

630
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,159
think are important and kind of

631
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,720
validated some of the things that I've

632
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,299
been seeing as well so definitely ego

633
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,820
was one of the first ones that came out

634
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,679
you know people people really treating

635
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,480
other people with contempt is is a

636
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,000
problem the lack of empathy and I think

637
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,240
that kind of highlights the uh the red

638
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,860
team not necessarily understanding what

639
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,240
the blue team is going through but also

640
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,360
vice versa right the The Blue Team uh

641
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
tends to say like okay these These are

642
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,740
jerks right I'm tired tired of them

643
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,020
always breaking in and never and never

644
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,760
uh you know feeling like we're getting

645
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,059
anywhere but but in reality red teaming

646
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,580
is hard too right being able to identify

647
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,380
what are the new techniques and tactics

648
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,120
that we should be testing how do we

649
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,620
communicate those effectively to the

650
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,960
organization and then you know she

651
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,840
mentioned uh Twitter drama

652
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,400
these ones are kind of long but but in

653
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,960
general uh you know one of them

654
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,419
highlighted that uh you know entry-level

655
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,000
jobs have a lot of you know you know

656
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,520
unrealistic job expectations

657
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,679
uh this other one on the left you know

658
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,780
identified hey we're not really viewing

659
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,640
ourselves the way that we actually sit

660
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,860
in the industry and in what our what our

661
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,260
actual role is and these these will be

662
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,659
available later so you can read through

663
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,940
these I they're memorialized now but but

664
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,980
they were uh they were on uh social

665
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,360
media

666
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
but I like what Jeff said in terms of in

667
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,640
terms of the good right uh uh you know

668
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,140
there's there's always new new problems

669
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,700
to solve and it's an exciting industry

670
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,380
to be in

671
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,340
um

672
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,860
and let's see uh you know there's

673
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,780
there's opportunity and it's growing and

674
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,340
there's there's Rec there's a continued

675
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,919
recognizing need for the for for the

676
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,900
jobs that we're filling

677
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,620
uh this one was interesting as well

678
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,360
you know highlighting that there's

679
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,100
there's not a true partnership within

680
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,140
the organ within the organizations that

681
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,020
that uh that that's really the the main

682
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,000
focus whether you're a consulting firm

683
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,539
testing against organizations or

684
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,640
um internal to the organization is there

685
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,320
true partnership across the or is there

686
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,080
true partnership across the org

687
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,419
and then uh you know being able to work

688
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,659
on challenging problems again right and

689
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,840
then good friend uh Casey Ellis you know

690
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,179
we're here because we're you know

691
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,159
intrigued by the attackers right that

692
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320
they are they're coming up with uh

693
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,200
fascinating things and uh how do we how

694
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,700
do we you know continue this cat and

695
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,440
mouse game to identify what are the

696
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,120
things that we should be doing to fix

697
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,940
and uh and how do we identify what their

698
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,919
next steps are right

699
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:17,820
um

700
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,760
the bad uh I think this is important

701
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,679
because it'll come up later but the

702
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,360
trailing indicators are what we focus on

703
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,840
rather than the leading indicators uh so

704
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,580
you know getting better metrics and good

705
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,980
data in the organization is actually

706
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,360
really critical

707
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,380
uh you know not not really having an

708
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,299
emphasis on you know what moves the

709
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,320
needle forward and that's what we're

710
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,500
going to talk about here in a second but

711
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,240
um the snake oil marketing is also

712
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,860
interesting as well

713
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,600
um Casey being another founder of a

714
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,919
security company is like hey they're

715
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,600
they're trying to actually achieve a

716
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,820
mission to do better things and they

717
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,320
tend to get you know people tend to get

718
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,179
distracted with the snake oil rather

719
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,980
than you know the solutions that

720
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,860
actually might help them succeed so I

721
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,480
think that's important and then Bryson

722
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,659
or who will be speaking later today

723
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,700
um you know the bad perfectionist for

724
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,980
the one percent Nerd Solutions for nerd

725
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,240
problems I think that was I thought that

726
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,860
was a funny one

727
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,360
um uh because like I think it's

728
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,940
important like hey you can you can soak

729
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,860
up a lot of time solving a specific

730
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,799
problem that is very interesting but

731
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,679
maybe not really that relative or uh you

732
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,240
know relevant sorry

733
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,700
um uh to the to the industry as a whole

734
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,520
so where where our time management goes

735
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,620
is important

736
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,299
not being able to speak to the business

737
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,880
I think and understand the impact of the

738
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,799
work that we're doing in business terms

739
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,299
because at the end of the day if we're

740
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,279
working for an organization especially

741
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,500
in the private sector you know that that

742
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,299
has an impact on the bottom line right

743
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,039
and so how do we how do we how do we

744
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,380
reflect what we're doing

745
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,620
um as it's as it is related to the

746
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,020
bottom line for other organizations like

747
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,000
you know government organizations you

748
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,520
know are we are we focused on what we're

749
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,559
achieving for the true mission right so

750
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,120
um and you know from the positives you

751
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,860
know the community is great right the

752
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,740
community is is solid and there is a lot

753
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,140
of collaboration out there and and the

754
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,700
people are what make that Community

755
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,020
great

756
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,580
um and then you know being able to focus

757
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,340
on uh the up and coming

758
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,380
um Security Professionals as well and

759
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,419
then the last one I thought was funny

760
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,940
um and you know relevant it it does it

761
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,279
does just really come down to people

762
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,320
right at the end of the day for both the

763
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,020
bad and and the good it ends up being

764
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,279
the people

765
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,140
um so

766
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,179
um so so we spent quite a bit of time

767
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,679
highlighting maybe things that aren't

768
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,260
new to anybody uh definitely perspective

769
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,260
that I've had and you know how I've

770
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,200
progressed in my career as well and and

771
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,700
um continuing to want to stay Mission

772
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,080
oriented

773
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,880
um so how do we land the plane you know

774
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,500
and move forward or what are some what

775
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,539
are some takeaways right so I was trying

776
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,279
to make sure like hey don't just you

777
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,840
know highlight problems let's let's talk

778
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,460
about the solutions and and how we get

779
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,539
better

780
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,279
um so like you know in general how do we

781
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,320
suck just a little bit less right how do

782
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,940
we how do we how do we make just a

783
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,380
little bit of progress over time and I

784
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,700
think that's an important perspective to

785
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,260
have it's like let's not get caught up

786
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,880
on what perfect looks like let's just

787
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,880
start with good and move from there many

788
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,980
people in my organization will recognize

789
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,539
that I tend to say like don't let

790
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,460
perfect be the enemy of good I say that

791
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,679
all the time how do we how do we make

792
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,960
sure we're making progress and and

793
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,240
moving forward and not getting wrapped

794
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,400
around axles right so it's always

795
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,200
important to ask the hard but the right

796
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,419
questions I alluded to this earlier

797
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,520
there but like as an organization if

798
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,380
you're an internal team

799
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,240
you know it's important to say like will

800
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,039
my company go out of business you know

801
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,480
if we're breached or will my you know

802
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,159
what what's the worst thing that can

803
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,840
happen

804
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,940
that's not an that's not always an easy

805
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,279
question to answer and I kind of alluded

806
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,080
to it before like smaller organizations

807
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,400
yeah it could be pretty devastating

808
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,919
large organizations it's it's going to

809
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,320
hurt and over time we may have other

810
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,260
other indicators of of what a breach has

811
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,480
over the last you know like in the in 20

812
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,960
or 30 years but on the whole large

813
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,820
organizations going to have more money

814
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,140
going to have more budget going to have

815
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,419
more resiliency against breaches you

816
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,399
know the first one may hurt second one

817
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,100
may be more devastating it may take two

818
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,260
or three or four before it really

819
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,299
becomes a problem for them to say like

820
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,100
hey we've really got to get a handle on

821
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,440
this or they'll go out of business does

822
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,600
my company you know truly care about

823
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,760
security it comes back to that age-old

824
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,100
problem of like convincing stakeholders

825
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,559
hey do they do we have buy-in from the

826
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,880
top

827
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,760
and then why should we care right like I

828
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,020
think these are these are good questions

829
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,240
to keep asking so that you you start to

830
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,100
stay focused on the right problems for

831
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,320
your organization we could we could talk

832
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,820
all day long about things that are good

833
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,440
for an organization or things that are

834
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
good you know in general but at the end

835
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,559
of the day everything's going to be

836
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,820
unique to your organization there's

837
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,440
going to be principles and fundamental

838
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,640
things that you want to get into place

839
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,399
but if if that's not going to move the

840
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:06,600
needle forward for your organization

841
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,120
focus on what will and that that takes

842
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,919
some dedicated time of just asking these

843
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,720
questions as a team why should we care

844
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,340
what what are the what are the purposes

845
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,960
what is the purpose of our organization

846
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,779
what is the purpose of our team

847
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:20,340
and what does great security look like

848
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,539
for us I think we saw

849
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:25,740
a quote the other day like you know we

850
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,600
tend to talk about like

851
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,059
um see I don't want to butcher here so

852
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,899
um you know uh what what am I best at as

853
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:37,080
opposed to uh ah shoot now I'm going to

854
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,940
mess it up one of my best app versus how

855
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,460
do I uh where where am I my best right

856
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,380
so I think it's important to kind of

857
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,320
stay focused on I'm my best when as

858
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,520
opposed to one of my best at

859
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,779
okay so so these are these are the hard

860
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,580
but the right questions to be asking of

861
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,500
our organizations if you're a consulting

862
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,419
firm these are important things to be

863
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,520
working with your organizations or your

864
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,220
customers on on getting truly to the

865
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,580
bottom and so like how do we maybe make

866
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,860
a little bit of a shift to answer some

867
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,000
of these questions I think it always

868
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,240
starts with data uh we tend to tend to

869
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,340
not like metrics and I think I think we

870
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,039
focus on a lot of the wrong metrics

871
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,899
today I think a lot of organizations

872
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,480
tend to focus on metrics around how many

873
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,220
vulnerabilities we just have in our

874
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,080
environment those are point in time

875
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,840
metrics rather than Trends and Analysis

876
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,659
but you know what what gets measured

877
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,640
gets done right and so if you start from

878
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,500
a data Centric approach of like hey what

879
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,120
are the key metrics we want to provide

880
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,320
at the end of the day what are the kpis

881
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,940
that we want to show as our team whether

882
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,460
we're an internal management team we're

883
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,880
an appsec team a sock or a pen testing

884
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,919
team because pen testing teams should

885
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,200
have metrics as well right I think it's

886
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,000
easy to just deliver reports all day

887
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,279
long and tell people what's wrong and

888
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,919
good luck go fixing those but is that is

889
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,140
that actually helpful right and I think

890
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,720
that you know the good organizations are

891
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,820
in the in the the good consulting firms

892
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,720
are the ones that are actually going to

893
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,840
help their customers get better so some

894
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,120
examples you know slas you know on on

895
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,159
pen test findings specifically if pen

896
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,480
tests are the most uh concentrated level

897
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,000
of risks that you're identifying for an

898
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,980
environment shouldn't those be called

899
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,500
out separately I mean I I would that's a

900
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,240
question right should those in your

901
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,440
environment be called out a little bit

902
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,020
differently than vulnerability findings

903
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,380
from scans right or appsec findings from

904
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,559
code scanners so maybe put some slas on

905
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,480
pen test findings and be able to to

906
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,980
highlight how quickly you're getting

907
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,140
those resolved and how quickly those

908
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,299
might be changing over time I think if

909
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,799
there's one thing that we've identified

910
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,659
is that

911
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:46,440
um

912
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,299
the criticals and highs tend to get

913
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,159
focused on a lot when they come out of

914
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,260
even a vulnerability scan but a pen test

915
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,720
specifically but those mediums and those

916
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,700
lows tend to over time Elevate into into

917
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,080
criticals and Highs but you may not have

918
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,500
as as deep of a handle on those findings

919
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,659
over time so being able to centralize

920
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,220
those and identify hey what are the

921
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,140
trends over time how are we resolving

922
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,539
highs versus mediums how often are these

923
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,880
moving into highs is is an important

924
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,539
metric I think coming coming into test

925
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:22,620
plans from a threat and or TTP coverage

926
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,600
perspective is is where we're headed as

927
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,039
an industry as well and I think it's

928
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,960
good if we can focus on hey as an

929
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,519
industry we're in the healthcare sector

930
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,019
what are the what are the primary

931
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:32,700
threats that we have to our environment

932
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,980
and can we provide threat and formed

933
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,559
test plans accordingly right so as

934
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,720
opposed to we had we did a webinar uh

935
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,659
the other a couple weeks ago and we

936
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,519
focused on this this topic a little bit

937
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,460
in terms of hey as a red team or a pen

938
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,679
testing team

939
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,019
is it is it as valuable to just have

940
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,880
carte blanche or is it actually more

941
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,820
valuable to say like hey we want to we

942
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,559
want to emulate these types of threats

943
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,019
as as as

944
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:01,980
providing a little bit more value to

945
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,779
these are known things that an

946
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,279
organization should be able to fix

947
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,500
otherwise pen testers and and red

948
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,418
teamers by Nature are going to kind of

949
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:11,159
revert to the same tactics that always

950
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,859
work right so it stretches the testing

951
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,359
team a little bit to say like hey no we

952
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,280
really need to simulate this type of a

953
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,679
threat actor and actually simulate these

954
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,320
these techniques versus just having carb

955
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,480
launch the carte blanche can still be

956
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,000
valuable uh you know to to identify

957
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,500
bigger gaps but at least you're

958
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,359
providing an organization with a roadmap

959
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,520
right and so something to think about

960
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,739
how much are we covered how much

961
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,960
coverage do we have with these attack

962
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,159
techniques you know miter attack

963
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,599
framework is great

964
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,480
um resource for that

965
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,159
and then I think I think building things

966
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,560
up to a PR into a program you know

967
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,000
perspective

968
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,859
um as a blue team everything's related

969
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,659
to what are the programs where

970
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,179
effectively you know are are initiating

971
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,219
today whether that's an identity

972
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,040
management program a an appsec program

973
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,320
so how do we speak in terms of risk

974
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,880
related to the different programmatic

975
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,200
areas in our environment

976
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:10,140
let's let's continue to collaborate Not

977
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,880
Just Between the red and the blue teams

978
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,160
but in or in teams outside of those

979
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,900
organizations

980
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,260
um so uh like I I quoted Landon who is

981
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,820
actually our VP of product because we

982
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,280
were having a discussion uh the other

983
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,740
day and I was kind of telling about my

984
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,780
talk he's like oh so he cut he came he

985
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,280
comes straight from product he's not had

986
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,380
as much exposure to the security space

987
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:35,700
until joining us and uh we built built

988
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,079
great products for other big

989
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,480
organizations and he said like yeah we

990
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,579
would get these results from all these

991
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,440
from the security team and didn't know

992
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,079
what to do with them right and and where

993
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,820
does that fit within the product roadmap

994
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,680
that they have like everybody's busy

995
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,000
right everybody has their own

996
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,520
initiatives and so having just a slight

997
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,320
amount of empathy of like how can we

998
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,020
work together to get these resolved was

999
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,760
important to him

1000
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,400
and I I mean it seems it seems obvious

1001
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,800
but I think it's important because it's

1002
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,720
clearly not always happening right and

1003
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,359
that that security teams uh for whatever

1004
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,700
reason it may not it's not necessarily

1005
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,339
hey I don't I don't want to help them I

1006
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,500
think it probably comes down to a lack

1007
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,420
of good communication how do we

1008
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,460
effectively you know get the message

1009
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,960
across like these are these are

1010
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,700
important here's how we can help you fix

1011
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,820
them right so being able to collaborate

1012
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,920
throughout the organization not just

1013
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,900
within our internal security teams is

1014
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,579
important

1015
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:35,339
I think it's always important to talk

1016
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:36,900
about feeling overwhelmed is like you do

1017
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,480
need to anticipate defeat uh you're you

1018
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,220
you're going to get breached that's a

1019
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,099
that's an if or that's a win not an if

1020
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,720
security is a journey

1021
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,940
um I'm a baseball player by nature or I

1022
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,040
mean by growing up and and so I used to

1023
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,020
coach baseball so you know I was trying

1024
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,520
to put it in perspective of like a Hall

1025
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,680
of Fame baseball player is going to fail

1026
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,260
70 of the time right or succeed 30 of

1027
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,820
the time now I'm not saying like hey

1028
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,040
that's that's the Benchmark for us as in

1029
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,359
security but I think it's an important

1030
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,400
litmus test of like what are the things

1031
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,680
that we really should give ourselves

1032
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,119
some Grace and where should we really

1033
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,619
focus and hunger down like hey we need

1034
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,960
to have a hundred percent coverage or as

1035
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,560
much coverage as possible on the crown

1036
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,780
jewels right things that things that are

1037
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,060
most critical to our environment and how

1038
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,099
are we working both red and blue to make

1039
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,839
sure that those are those are as locked

1040
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,520
down as possible and then what are the

1041
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,839
what are the things on the edges that

1042
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,820
we'll get to later and and you know

1043
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,099
continue to prioritize and anticipate

1044
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:33,660
that we're going to have some some

1045
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,339
failures there right

1046
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,320
and then just continue to act with

1047
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,820
purpose understand what the vision in

1048
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,260
the mission is for your organization

1049
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,079
within the security security team and in

1050
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,940
the company as a whole or if a

1051
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,160
government agency or whatever being able

1052
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,500
to identify like this is where this is

1053
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,240
where the train is going we're all

1054
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,119
rowing or it's a bad analogy we're all

1055
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,520
moving in the same direction right

1056
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,880
continue to be better mentors this comes

1057
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,339
back to Bryson's comments about hey

1058
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:03,540
being able to raise up the next

1059
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,180
generation is important we always know

1060
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,660
we're going to have a gap this is a this

1061
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,000
is a very technical field it's not easy

1062
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,940
to get into just simply from a it takes

1063
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,859
time to understand how things work

1064
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,260
there's very few people that that pick

1065
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,480
up on it right away and so people come

1066
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,220
into the space I always I always say

1067
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,140
like I got into security the the most

1068
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,940
formal way I've ever heard of right like

1069
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,040
most people did not go to college and

1070
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,960
graduate school to get into cyber

1071
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,940
security that's very very rare and I

1072
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,800
feel very blessed but

1073
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,020
um I I we all recognize that's that's

1074
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,520
not how people are going to continue to

1075
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,619
get into security how do we continue to

1076
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,780
train them up and and build up the Next

1077
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,240
Generation

1078
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,800
educate without contempt I think this

1079
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
this kind of comes back to that empathy

1080
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,180
and ego perspective don't treat people

1081
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,520
you know less than you right I mean it's

1082
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,040
it's kind of a general human concept but

1083
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,660
I think it's important important in the

1084
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,160
in the security space as well and

1085
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,599
continue to give back this is why I love

1086
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,880
uh working with the wild west I mean

1087
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,619
with black hills and wild west hacking

1088
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,420
Fest team they're just such fantastic

1089
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,920
people in general like we just love

1090
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,960
working with them but uh they they

1091
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,400
always give back right they're not

1092
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,040
focused on you know having everything be

1093
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,780
around you know making a profit or

1094
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,880
whatever but but truly making the world

1095
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,920
a better place and so I think if we come

1096
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,240
at it with that mentality that's

1097
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,980
important

1098
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,900
I think it's important to promote

1099
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,599
diversity this is not a joke I think if

1100
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,420
you you know kind of have seen the the

1101
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,579
distribution of people in in the

1102
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,200
security space there's there's

1103
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,880
definitely not as much diversity as

1104
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,380
there needs to be I think that's a

1105
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,820
common topic I just wanted to

1106
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,320
memorialize that this is really

1107
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,480
important the the broader perspectives

1108
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,640
that we have the better we're off uh the

1109
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,859
better our off we are so continue to

1110
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:49,578
focus on that

1111
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,079
celebrate your progress the big and the

1112
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,260
small wins this boosts morale I know

1113
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,960
from uh from uh you know from some of

1114
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,460
the wins that we celebrate within Plex

1115
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,980
track when we get organizations that are

1116
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,300
saying like hey our team it just has

1117
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,920
better morale because we got more done

1118
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,960
that's important right celebrate those

1119
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,599
kinds of things and and don't overlook

1120
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,680
them

1121
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,839
um and you know make sure that you do

1122
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,640
focus on these are the metrics we're

1123
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,140
driving to and when we have the small

1124
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,660
wins and celebrate those and make that

1125
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,880
important because it's easy to get

1126
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,920
caught up on the breaches and the

1127
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,079
attacks and the incidents and how do we

1128
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,180
you know what did we do wrong and as

1129
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,560
opposed to focusing on what have we done

1130
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,880
right you know what are the things that

1131
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,460
are going well uh and then you know how

1132
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,800
do we continue to emphasize those as we

1133
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,020
move forward

1134
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,760
and then I think you know kind of coming

1135
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,339
back to that that notion of

1136
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,640
um the the mental health aspects don't

1137
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,800
put your identity in your job like this

1138
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,720
is important uh it's it's it's it's it's

1139
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,940
good for you to have you know a mission

1140
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,579
at hand but take time for yourself take

1141
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,560
time for your your relationships whoever

1142
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,960
those are friends family

1143
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,940
um you know take time for yourself uh

1144
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,800
take time for others relationships do

1145
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,560
matter most of all and you know keeping

1146
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,660
things in perspective helps helps stay

1147
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,140
helps keep everybody healthy and uh and

1148
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,880
driving towards you know the right

1149
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,520
things and and not getting burnt out I

1150
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,500
think is important because I think it's

1151
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,960
easy to see insecurity that we do have

1152
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,119
an industry with a propensity to get

1153
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,700
burnt out and that's not gonna that's

1154
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,740
not gonna work long term

1155
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,119
so that was a very jam-packed session

1156
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,940
but to kind of land the plane finally

1157
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,380
you know like I would definitely say

1158
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,940
like absolutely we are making a

1159
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,920
difference there's a lot of there's a

1160
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,180
lot of great things going on in the

1161
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,859
security space especially on the red

1162
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:43,800
team side and the blue team side uh you

1163
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,119
know and we've made a lot of progress

1164
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,280
sure there's lots of warts along the way

1165
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,680
uh and so how do we continue to stay

1166
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,480
focused on getting better while

1167
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,220
celebrating the wins I definitely feel

1168
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,040
like we are uh making a difference and

1169
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,020
appreciate everybody's time happy to

1170
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,820
open it up for discussion and if there

1171
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,060
were any questions on online so

1172
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,619
thanks Dan there was one question that

1173
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,660
came in from Discord are you familiar

1174
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,780
with the Navy's cyber ready program have

1175
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,220
you heard anything about that

1176
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,160
have not okay so they asked what you

1177
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,720
thought about it I'll just quick summary

1178
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,760
basically the Navy has announced hey

1179
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,500
focusing on compliance and trying to

1180
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,820
keep everything in check is not working

1181
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,859
so we're going to shift towards

1182
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,740
continuous monitoring ongoing risk

1183
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,660
assessments like constant stuff and just

1184
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,280
focus on trying to stay ahead of things

1185
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,099
rather than focus on Audits and

1186
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:33,420
compliance and all that kind of stuff

1187
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,040
and so somebody just asked if you have

1188
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,660
any thoughts on that and and the impact

1189
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,400
I I think that's I think that's the

1190
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,079
right progression right I think I think

1191
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,520
there's things that aren't working and

1192
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,740
and you know we all know there's that

1193
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,720
that I don't want to kind of get like

1194
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,400
hey there's that wrapped around the like

1195
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,960
security compliance you know argument

1196
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,280
but at the end of the day what what

1197
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,420
problem are we trying to solve we're

1198
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,820
trying to breached right and so when we

1199
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,740
when we know what we're testing for

1200
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,319
being in a continuous mode that's the

1201
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,240
right way forward so I I completely

1202
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,980
agree and I think that is the right next

1203
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,180
step in Evolution for all us all yeah

1204
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,779
yes

1205
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,719
[Music]

1206
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:23,220
yeah that's great so I'll repeat the

1207
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,859
question for people online so earlier I

1208
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,060
mentioned that when I was a security

1209
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,060
director I tried to allocate 70 of our

1210
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,680
time for the reactive or what I would

1211
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,440
also call the Legacy issues versus the

1212
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,200
30 on the proactive side

1213
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,140
um so so how we did that was uh we would

1214
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,200
spend you know we knew like coming in

1215
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,700
every organization would win a security

1216
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,260
program gets started there's a lot of

1217
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,700
other things you got to do just to kind

1218
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,220
of get going right so the the goal was

1219
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,079
start in that kind of allocation I think

1220
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,180
actually we started at like 80 20 and

1221
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,220
then kind of we wanted to move to where

1222
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,079
it was going to be more 50 50 or you

1223
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,119
know you eventually just continue to you

1224
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,280
know the the the the math should work

1225
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,839
out the more you focus on the proactive

1226
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,400
stuff the less Legacy things you have

1227
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,859
right so so that was the mentality that

1228
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:09,839
we brought to it so with the reactive

1229
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,780
items we were focused on you know the

1230
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,480
Sim getting the sock ready we outsourced

1231
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,839
to an mssp for like egress monitoring

1232
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,640
and things like that then with the

1233
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,280
proactive side we actually uh we

1234
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,260
actually went with that kind of that

1235
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,359
purple teaming model and

1236
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,400
because we had an internal development

1237
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,099
organization uh you know we went to like

1238
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:35,160
a two-week Sprint cycle where uh we

1239
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,420
would say okay we're gonna we're gonna

1240
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,119
start testing techniques in lateral

1241
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,040
movement let's say like we feel like we

1242
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,480
feel like we have a gap there but we

1243
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,619
don't necessarily know what those

1244
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,180
techniques are that we're missing so

1245
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,579
we'd spend like two weeks testing those

1246
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:49,319
things as part of that proactive life

1247
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,940
cycle and it really was just a

1248
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,500
discipline in terms of like allocating

1249
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,300
the time making sure you have the time

1250
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,040
because you can always get caught up in

1251
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,780
the reactive stuff but if you actually

1252
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,880
dedicate the time you're gonna you're

1253
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,680
gonna actually start making progress so

1254
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,240
we'd spend two weeks hey we tested this

1255
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,800
set of techniques it was like small at

1256
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,420
the beginning and then we were able to

1257
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,740
like from The Blue Team perspective

1258
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,000
saying okay what do we need to configure

1259
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,819
differently to make to make this better

1260
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:13,500
and so we actually saw a lot of progress

1261
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,319
you know doing it that way so the goal

1262
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,020
was to continue to you know spend more

1263
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,359
time on the proactive side once we felt

1264
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,280
like we had you know a decent handle on

1265
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,859
some of those reactive issues

1266
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:28,640
good question

1267
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,540
yes

1268
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,240
so the question was related to you know

1269
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,640
burnout and how do we how do we get

1270
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,560
better or how are we making progress in

1271
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,619
attracting and retaining talent I think

1272
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:10,140
my perspective is it's always going to

1273
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,240
be hard right for for a couple of

1274
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,460
reasons one I mean it is it is a

1275
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,260
technical role there's it's not

1276
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,000
something that it's easy to get into

1277
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,980
right I think you do have to being in

1278
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,180
security specifically you have to

1279
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,500
understand a lot about a lot of things

1280
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,940
right

1281
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,859
um at least when you when we're talking

1282
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:28,140
about small teams in mid-sized

1283
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,520
organizations which is going to be a

1284
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,200
majority right if you're in a big

1285
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,060
company you probably have you might even

1286
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,040
have 200 people on your security team so

1287
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,020
you can you can have like those more

1288
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,180
Niche focuses like hey I only focus on

1289
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,420
malware analysis you know or forensics

1290
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,520
um you know versus I'm a generalist that

1291
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,260
has to know a lot of has to know a

1292
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,000
little about all those things right so I

1293
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,640
think I think being able to focus on how

1294
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,200
do we make the current teams more

1295
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,780
efficient and to build morale there is

1296
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,000
probably is is my approach to the best

1297
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,359
start because if if people from the

1298
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,520
outside see that this that these people

1299
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,460
burn out every 18 months you're right

1300
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,560
why do I want to take a job like that

1301
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,260
right so or they tend to move around I

1302
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,240
think I think a lot of people will tend

1303
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,339
to bounce out of a blue team into more

1304
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:16,800
of a red team type Focus or move from

1305
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,599
there's a lot of revolving doors and

1306
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:19,800
Security today

1307
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,960
so I think the the focus should be on

1308
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,640
how do we how do we make sure we're

1309
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,140
measuring the right things and making

1310
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,000
the team as efficient as possible so

1311
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,099
they have more morale about we're making

1312
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,440
better progress that's one approach

1313
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,440
right I think that we have seen we have

1314
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,480
seen work

1315
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,099
but then I also think that it's

1316
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,200
important to just make sure that we are

1317
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,540
taking care of our people right how do

1318
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,000
we make sure I think it's asking simple

1319
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,380
questions of like hey do you need to

1320
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,000
take a day off today you know I mean

1321
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,680
those kinds of things which is more

1322
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,599
General to the to the populace as a

1323
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,060
whole I think

1324
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,339
um unfortunately my my hunch is that

1325
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:59,700
that you know covid also had a huge

1326
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,220
impact on just the the mental state of

1327
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,420
everybody

1328
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,680
um so you know we've got some we've got

1329
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,880
some work to do there but I think

1330
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,560
important what's important is focusing

1331
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,359
on the people you know how are they

1332
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,440
doing

1333
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,079
um it's you know how can how can I help

1334
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,200
you know and and and then when we talk

1335
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,060
about attracting Talent being able to

1336
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,319
speak

1337
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:22,020
um you know rational to people not not

1338
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,819
oversell it but say like hey here's what

1339
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:24,960
here's what you're getting yourself into

1340
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,000
here's what I like about it and here's

1341
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,619
here's the challenges that we all have

1342
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:30,300
to work through together right

1343
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,280
good question one more question here Dan

1344
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,920
from uh Discord what are some examples

1345
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,560
of key metrics or kpis that teams should

1346
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,660
focus on or do you have any tips in

1347
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,160
general when it comes to selecting

1348
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,420
metrics

1349
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,220
yeah so I think

1350
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,500
um I I kind of mentioned some of them

1351
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,900
earlier some of the newer ones that I

1352
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,940
think are important and and as as we've

1353
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,859
talked to like other cisos and things

1354
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:55,260
like that I think having a distinct

1355
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,180
metric around your pen test results and

1356
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,680
in your continuous Assessment program

1357
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,079
like are you getting coverage within the

1358
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,420
threat landscape so how many techniques

1359
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,160
have you tested I think that if there's

1360
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,740
one like lovely beautiful thing that has

1361
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,900
come out recently is the miter attack

1362
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,420
framework I'm just I love it because it

1363
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,099
puts it in perspective of how the

1364
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:17,700
organization is is you know where

1365
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,960
they're at in terms of being able to

1366
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,520
detect those different techniques in the

1367
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,319
life cycle so putting metrics around

1368
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,660
those how much coverage have we had how

1369
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,240
how well are we able to detect and block

1370
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,780
these these attack techniques over time

1371
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,660
so those are some some basic ones I

1372
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,819
think you always want to put things in

1373
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:38,460
the matter of Trends as much as possible

1374
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,400
point in time metrics are pretty graphs

1375
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,079
and pie graphs are pretty but they're

1376
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,599
not they're not showing any they're not

1377
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,760
providing you much information so being

1378
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,099
able to put things into Trends and I

1379
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:52,020
think putting it in relative of Time how

1380
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,760
quickly are we resolving these issues

1381
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,339
that gets that get reported and breaking

1382
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:57,780
categorizing them a little differently

1383
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,040
than just straight up vulnerabilities

1384
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,940
and straight up risks

1385
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,520
great well

1386
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,859
I think we're good awesome well thanks

1387
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:09,480
Dan everybody give Dan a round of

1388
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,460
applause

1389
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,440
[Applause]

1390
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,280
thank you
