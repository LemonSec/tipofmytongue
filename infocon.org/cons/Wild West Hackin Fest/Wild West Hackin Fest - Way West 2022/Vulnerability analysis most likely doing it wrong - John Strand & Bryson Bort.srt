1
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,580
we're basically going to just trigger

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,379
each other

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,880
um because I have certain pet peeves

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,559
does anybody have any idea what topics

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,420
is anybody surprised that John has

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,759
opinions raise your hand if you're

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,500
surprised that John has opinions it's

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,420
nothing like John has opinions so that's

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,119
none is this thing on nope nope yours is

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,060
mine song You Wanna you wanna talk into

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,519
my nipple there I can talk again again

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,820
check

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,399
all right and we're up so

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,079
come on over come on you guys can eat

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,579
down here we got tables come on down

16
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,399
come on down

17
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,640
join us

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,500
we got to put the hoods up though right

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,420
that's how this works that is how this

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,620
works so uh this John discovered that I

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,840
use a good smelling shampoo he was like

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,219
spelling the inside of the hood and I

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,719
was like that's pure Bryson right there

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,770
it smells like Rogaine no that's me

25
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:57,780
[Laughter]

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,780
um

27
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,760
um so just to introduce Bryce and Bryson

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,799
I have no idea when we first met I think

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,840
it was in DC

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
um we've basically met I believe at

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,119
dinner uh that was like two blocks away

32
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,820
from the Wardman Park uh the Woodley

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,040
station and we had I think it was

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,260
Chinese food or something and we were

35
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,060
commiserating over starting businesses

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,880
and what a horrible idea it was to start

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,680
a business

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,320
um but uh we basically kind of came up

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,640
you were doing side I was doing active

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,500
countermeasures and VHS oh we met before

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,600
Scythe uh we've been doing this for a

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,060
really really long time and today like I

43
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,200
said we're going to trigger each other

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,680
is my horn straight your horns up don't

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,659
worry nope you're good are you there

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,640
they have drugs for that now they do

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,020
your Horn's good

48
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,560
so all right so I'm gonna go first

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,340
um

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,979
go ahead not trigger me go for it

51
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,340
trigger you

52
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,600
so uh let's start with deception

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,700
technology a lot of people think

54
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,159
deception technology is and

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,200
those people are wrong and I think that

56
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,700
you're specifically talking about people

57
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,959
like moss uh who runs uh runs Defcon and

58
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,940
I think Brian Krebs has also said that

59
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,440
as well so I'm going to piss off then

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,720
too because that's these things are warm

61
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,819
by the way they are they are why do you

62
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,280
think mine's unzipped warm it's a

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,200
veteran unicorn here I know how toasty

64
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,420
they get so yeah I can see why a lot of

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,920
people don't like the idea of the like

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,260
deception technology because if you look

67
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,300
at Deception technology Bruce and I are

68
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,220
years ago came out and he said that

69
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,959
security through obscurity is no

70
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,720
security at all and once again

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
there's another infosec luminary that

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,280
I'm going to say is wrong

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,260
um he's wrong security through obscurity

74
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,080
works really really really well if you

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,700
have the proper alerting and logging

76
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,340
associated with it so if an attacker

77
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,860
breaks into your network and they trip

78
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,720
on the trip wires there should be

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,459
something that alerts you that they

80
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,019
tripped on those tripwires and it

81
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,280
doesn't have to be expensive it can be

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,780
honey accounts can be curb roastable

83
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,640
accounts it can be files in the

84
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,200
environment you don't have to stand up

85
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,260
Windows 2000 boxes and basically set it

86
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,480
up so they have to hack into a Windows

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,940
2000 box it could be simple things and

88
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,200
this is going to tie into some of the

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
stuff that he's talking about a little

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,340
bit later if you know what an attacker

91
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,040
does post exploitation it becomes a lot

92
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,540
easier to put the deception technology

93
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,819
in the proper places where attackers

94
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,720
usually go but yes so Krebs moss and

95
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,099
schneier suck it all right so I want to

96
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,920
add on that so I I used to be

97
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,840
anti-deception technology as well and

98
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,340
you actually convinced me but you didn't

99
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,500
you didn't realize how you convinced me

100
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,680
so I used to do real offense and I ran

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
up against folks who actually tried to

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,040
do like dedicated deception technology

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,080
like we've got the honey pots we got the

104
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,700
honey pots in the network and we're

105
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,340
being so clever and when you're doing

106
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,920
real apt where work it's not Smash and

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,099
grab you got time to watch and you just

108
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,260
watch and you can tell when something's

109
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,299
fake right when it sits there and it

110
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,280
only gets used occasionally clearly it's

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,040
fake right it sticks out and the thing

112
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,140
that actually convinced me about it is

113
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,360
it was not that you're actually you're

114
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,980
going to be able to confuse the a

115
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,939
players

116
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,798
it was the fact that it's like putting

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,358
up the alarm sticker on your house you

118
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,320
know where you have that and it's like

119
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,199
we're monitored by ADT oh most the time

120
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,759
you're not right like you stop paying

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,580
the 99 a month a couple of years ago but

122
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,840
a criminal doesn't know the difference

123
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,300
right when I see the sticker now I have

124
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,880
to think maybe this place is monitored

125
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,100
maybe there is an alarm system that's

126
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,259
here and so the biggest advantage that I

127
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,180
see to deception technology is if

128
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,979
there's a whiff of deception technology

129
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,740
in an environment any attacker is going

130
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,500
to have to extend their decision Loop

131
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,780
you've now just added time into it

132
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,580
because it's not that you're necessarily

133
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,080
going to guarantee that I'm going to

134
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
make a mistake but I have to take longer

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,820
so I don't possibly make a mistake

136
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,320
thinking it might be in the environment

137
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,479
so you're buying yourself time where the

138
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,820
attacker has to go slower can't just go

139
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,919
in and run out real fast and that

140
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,600
decision Loop process is no longer

141
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,520
you've now put yourself inside the

142
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,620
attacker's head well and that gets into

143
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,180
we've both done cyber offensive

144
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,800
operations for hot nation state on

145
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,979
nation-state action so hot when the rule

146
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,960
the number one rule I had for the groups

147
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
I worked with was don't get caught

148
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,720
don't get burnt and deception changes

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,940
that right so my turn

150
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,500
um what exactly is the difference

151
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,199
between adversary emulation and

152
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,900
simulation because I see you talk about

153
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,639
this all the time and there's people

154
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,580
that honestly are like looking in like

155
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,820
the dictionary thinking they're synonyms

156
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,860
and there's no differences are we just

157
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,020
splitting hairs why does it matter

158
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,419
so this is a funny thing when you become

159
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,220
a product vendor is you are suddenly

160
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,960
subject to whatever the marketing

161
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,419
definition of something is

162
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,400
when I went and created sites six years

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,560
ago Cobalt strike was the only

164
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
commercial red team product on the

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,639
planet and the entire way that we did

166
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
pen testing and red team as a community

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,259
was literally built off For Better or

168
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,259
Worse what Cobalt strike was well For

169
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,759
Better or Worse there are disadvantages

170
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,039
and constraints to that and so the full

171
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,900
story of how I the idea of sight came up

172
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,960
was not me looking to create an idea

173
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,940
um everybody know the company Target

174
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,860
you've shopped there

175
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,080
Target came to me in 2016 and asked me

176
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,639
to build on a one-off implant because

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,340
they couldn't test something and I was

178
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,560
like hold on there's no way you need to

179
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,880
do custom research and development and

180
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,500
do that it sounds like you've done all

181
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,360
the work to define a product idea for me

182
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,819
clearly the market needs a different way

183
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,160
to do risk assessments and so that was

184
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,440
where the idea of sight came from and so

185
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,940
as I'm sitting there in my you know

186
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,979
little couch coming up with this idea

187
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,100
and building out over a couple of years

188
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,300
suddenly I kind of woke up because

189
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,160
Forester and Gartner came out with a

190
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,919
quadrant and once a quadrant exists well

191
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,259
now it's real

192
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,360
and that quadrant was called breach and

193
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,699
attack simulation and I was like whoa

194
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,440
there are other people doing that that's

195
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,380
really cool what are they doing and I

196
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,520
would look at the marketing and the

197
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,020
marketing was like we're offense we're

198
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,940
APG in a box you don't need a red team

199
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,400
we got you we can automate red team now

200
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,220
he's now he's trying to trick her me

201
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,380
and I was like huh are they actually

202
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,900
able to do that and as I started to peel

203
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,080
it back I realized no not even close

204
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,539
what they had done is they had taken the

205
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,180
evolution of GRC compliance and found a

206
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,740
way to automate that with a little bit

207
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,599
of a security checklist on top but now

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,160
there's this like idea of attack

209
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,199
simulation out there and I'm like all

210
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,539
right well the description of the

211
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,580
category seems to be what we're doing

212
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,160
but it's literally defined by the

213
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,599
hundreds of millions of dollars being

214
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,400
invested in how all these other vendors

215
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,919
are actually doing it by the way half of

216
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,020
them are Israeli go figure it's what you

217
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,819
do if you're an Israeli entrepreneur you

218
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,259
wake up and eat your Wheaties and figure

219
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,699
out how do I start a company in America

220
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,280
yeah you had something you would add I

221
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,900
was going to say beautiful gooeys though

222
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,319
oh the Israelis the best gooeys

223
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,360
cornflower blue as far as the eye can

224
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,460
see yep hey wait a minute that's never

225
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,099
mind and so I'm sitting here stuck with

226
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,380
attack simulation now has a meaning

227
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,560
that's not attack simulation so what can

228
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,259
I do and I was like well I at the time

229
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,240
started going on the the circuit with

230
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,680
educating folks on a different approach

231
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,300
to Red teaming so if you were at Derby

232
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,440
con or if you've been at some of the

233
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
security conferences like five six years

234
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,879
ago this was all new stuff right purple

235
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,159
teaming all that nobody was really doing

236
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,779
any of this and so I'm out there like

237
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,640
hey there's a different way and I called

238
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,620
it adversarial emulation because at the

239
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,860
end of the day security is defined by

240
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,300
the threat not your checklist

241
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,980
so what's the real difference between

242
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,019
emulation and simulation and why do you

243
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,700
care because it's really a nerd argument

244
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,920
and the market does not care at all no

245
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,019
customer cares about this at all but why

246
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,820
we care as practitioners right it's why

247
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,500
we get in the debate of what is actually

248
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,019
penetration testing what is a Reds team

249
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,820
what is a vulnerability assessment we

250
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,620
have the same kind of thing where

251
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,140
marketers have co-opted our language in

252
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,600
our practitioner field and abused it to

253
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,899
sell so the difference is simulation is

254
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,060
where I am approximating something right

255
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,000
so a great example is ransomware

256
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,380
ransomware is clearly been a Scourge

257
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,240
that has actually finally broken the

258
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,920
public Consciousness the same way that

259
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,140
Target did 10 years ago and gotten the

260
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,519
attention of we need to invest in this

261
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,940
how do I safely demonstrate an

262
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,320
assessment of something that is

263
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,540
inherently destructive because I can't

264
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,620
actually destroy the production

265
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,899
environment that will get me fired so

266
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,540
here's where I have to do a simulation

267
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,640
so an example of a simulation is I get

268
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,700
on the box I create an invisible folder

269
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,980
with some dummy files and then I encrypt

270
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,380
that I now have done all of the host

271
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,959
activities of the equivalent of

272
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,480
ransomware without actually doing the

273
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
destruction so I've simulated that

274
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,620
component the emulation will be the

275
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,720
command and control where that implant

276
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,480
is calling out to its jump node to going

277
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,220
back to the operator to do those things

278
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,680
right if I did data exfiltration of

279
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,500
actual data I've now emulated and you

280
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,140
can see what was the DLP against that so

281
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,820
the way I like to take that down is

282
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,980
right at that last Point simulation is

283
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,620
running scripts and I ad hoc bespoke

284
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,860
parts of the attack path emulation is

285
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,440
end to end it's what is actually being

286
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,760
taken from the environment what is

287
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,839
actually being encrypted in the

288
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,100
environment all the way up to the

289
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,500
command and control side so I'm big in

290
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,740
music so used to have all these devices

291
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,600
that you would have like synthesizers

292
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,399
and drum machines and they were physical

293
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,339
devices and now they're all emulated in

294
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,260
products like reason but they're

295
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,660
actually emulated down to the Circuit

296
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,240
level to replicate with that particular

297
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,579
device does and it has to be you can't

298
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,040
just simulate it you emulate it from

299
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,279
beginning signal input to Output of what

300
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,959
happens and that's the fundamental

301
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,459
difference because you can simulate all

302
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,839
the time and you're going to be wrong

303
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,940
once you start creating an emulator

304
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,160
think of a video game like Nintendo

305
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,800
emulators they are literally emulating

306
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,040
the circuitry of a Nintendo so the

307
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,700
software that runs on that emulator

308
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,959
executes the way it would and the real

309
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,300
thing so that's how I try to so like

310
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,220
let's pick up on that why does it matter

311
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,620
of going end to end right so for example

312
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,360
there's a really good product here today

313
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,120
it's free it's open source Red Canary I

314
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,380
don't know if Adam machinchi's in here

315
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,480
he's the director for it and it's called

316
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,060
Atomic red team

317
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,420
and it does atomic tests now that has

318
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,519
value but there's a gap to what that

319
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,140
value is so what would you say that Gap

320
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,700
is a lot of the Gap is that each of the

321
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,920
atomic tests exist in and of themselves

322
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,200
so whenever you run the atomic test it

323
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,540
can do like you know script objects and

324
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,940
downloading SCT files executing download

325
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,040
the downloaded or downloading the SCT

326
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,019
files you can also see where it does

327
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,660
compression of files and maybe tries to

328
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,339
zip those things off but they're

329
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,579
discrete tests that run pretty much

330
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,980
independent of each other a lot of value

331
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,899
in that I think it's awesome that's

332
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,320
great but it doesn't say from the entire

333
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,760
chain from the beginning all the way

334
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,459
through the end what what points like

335
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,839
what's our depth of coverage what point

336
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,160
do we actually break God damn it I'm

337
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,019
going to say cyber kill chain

338
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,579
um looking at the entire attack path

339
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,320
methodology n10 it doesn't do that very

340
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,940
so I was going to Pivot that into miter

341
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,040
attack who's heard of miter attack oh

342
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,019
Jesus right I mean we pretty much have

343
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,640
to pay royalties if we don't say miter

344
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,140
attack about Minor attack on how to

345
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,899
attack attack

346
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,399
here's the fault of minor attack and how

347
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,620
it feeds right into that right miter

348
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,800
attack is great we now have a common

349
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,660
vernacular to be able to describe

350
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,279
techniques tactics and procedures

351
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,380
between each other no longer can we

352
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,300
debate well is it this or is that no

353
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,240
that means this and that's where it fits

354
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,760
right that's awesome but here's where

355
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,040
it's bad right it's so easy to look at

356
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,959
each one of those boxes and be like oh

357
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,519
all right well I've got these Atomic

358
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,399
tests I've completed that box we've now

359
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,560
solved initial execution

360
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,440
we're done here's the gap

361
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,500
look at miter attack as a periodic table

362
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,860
each one of those is an element and just

363
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,320
like in real life those elements the

364
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,060
quality of those elements the order of

365
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,980
those elements gives you a very

366
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,680
particular chemical equation which is

367
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,959
what an attack is right so I can test

368
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,700
things atomically like this is what

369
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,860
hydrogen does this is what oxygen does

370
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,839
turns out when I have two hydrogen one

371
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,180
oxygen that's completely different thing

372
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,519
and how that works in the real world is

373
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,500
attacks are State based right where I am

374
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,579
the Privileges I have change what I can

375
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,579
do if I've stolen credentials my ability

376
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,560
to do lateral movement is going to be

377
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,740
eminently different than if I don't so I

378
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,019
can do an atomic test but if I can't

379
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,660
chain them together where this leads to

380
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,000
this leads to this which by the way is

381
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
what an attacker does in the real world

382
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,560
then I'm not getting the true benefit of

383
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
understanding that context and here's

384
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,200
the real Roi to put the business term on

385
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,360
it that you care about

386
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
exploits are forever vulnerabilities

387
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,880
will always exist access will inevitably

388
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,579
happen it will happen

389
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,339
here's the cool thing if you look at an

390
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,800
attack compared to a new attack compared

391
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,519
to tomorrow's attack 90 to 95 of the

392
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,339
attack chains ttps

393
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,760
are the same think about that they're

394
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,220
the same they are only doing certain

395
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,740
novel Innovations in the tradecraft to

396
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,540
tweak here here and here

397
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,000
and if you focus on that attack Chain

398
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,279
Looking For Those you will not

399
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,320
absolutely stop every attack right

400
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,380
you're not stopping the zero day apt but

401
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,180
you will start catching the attack chain

402
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,880
quicker and more reliably over time if

403
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,740
you're doing that well and that gets

404
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,660
into one of the things that we didn't

405
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,800
jump into it but like threat

406
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,440
intelligence I absolutely hate the idea

407
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,139
where people put out and they say this

408
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,120
is the attack path like like I'm just

409
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,620
gonna say it you got groups like mandian

410
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,139
right they release a report on apt

411
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,660
random number here and they say these

412
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,519
are the techniques that they use and I

413
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,540
think that there's value in

414
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,760
understanding that but what I hate is

415
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,519
how vendors say we detect and we work

416
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,800
within that specific attack path and a

417
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,199
lot of Executives then say oh great well

418
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,699
we're protected against the 15 things

419
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,399
this apt group does we're defended

420
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,320
against that apt group and that's

421
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,880


422
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,980
whenever you see those reports that they

423
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,660
come out and they say this is what apt

424
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,540
2827 said Panda Shadow Panda Lazarus

425
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,540
group lapsis whoever that's what they

426
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,320
detected in that attack attackers will

427
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
always use the techniques and the

428
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,940
vulnerabilities that are available to

429
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,800
them at the time of the attack on the

430
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,120
specific environment that they're

431
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,420
attacking attackers are like water if

432
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,459
you have a leaky roof you can have a

433
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,079
leak at the top of your house and it

434
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,540
goes all the way down it's not going to

435
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,180
follow the same path every single time

436
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,880
and this gets into my probably my

437
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,560
biggest rant and I have no idea and I'm

438
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,699
going to turn this into a question you

439
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:15,779
think about it and then at the end you

440
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,300
answer it why in the hell hasn't nessus

441
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,839
why hasn't koalas why hasn't rapid 7 for

442
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,360
their vulnerability management project

443
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,139
products that they have either

444
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,060
Incorporated simulation or emulation

445
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,220
post exploitation as part of their

446
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,160
vulnerability management profiles why

447
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,620
how come I can't run a scanner and it

448
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,600
emulates an attacker and it pivots

449
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,040
around my environment it says well

450
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,440
you're missing these patches and oh by

451
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,120
the way you have three Kerber roastable

452
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,820
accounts why is that not part of our

453
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,800
vulnerability management discussions

454
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,320
that we are having today because that's

455
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,459
going to give you a much Fuller

456
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:51,660
understanding of vulnerability

457
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,699
management if you look at miter and you

458
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,500
look at the entire Matrix

459
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,839
do you have any idea how many of those

460
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,759
vulnerabilities are actually detected by

461
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,500
an external vulnerability scanner

462
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,120
photography

463
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,059
it's like two or three

464
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,339
it's like exploit remote exploitable

465
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,500
remote service and then the other one is

466
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,679
exploit a misconfiguration

467
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,799
additional access that's it too so

468
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,059
you're spending thousands of dollars

469
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,040
chasing your tail trying to patch

470
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,720
everything what you should do by the way

471
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,640
you should absolutely do it but yet

472
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,260
we're ignoring 98 or more of what an

473
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,580
attacker actually does in our

474
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,559
environment for checking our real

475
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,299
vulnerability surface in our environment

476
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,160
and that drives me insane because when

477
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,539
we do pen tests and we find

478
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,280
vulnerabilities there's a lot of times

479
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,620
people are like what exactly is the CVSs

480
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,020
scores has anybody actually assessed the

481
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,880
technique that you've done to give us a

482
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,620
criticality because I noticed in your

483
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,200
report you said it's critical but I

484
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
don't see that actually tied to anything

485
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,919
on the open Internet it's like who cares

486
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,080
it's how we got domain administrator

487
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,940
it's how we got access to your sensitive

488
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,100
data and that chain from initial access

489
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,380
to how we got it needs to be taken in

490
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,840
context and more importantly because of

491
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,520
the taxonomy because of the periodic

492
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,460
table for the first time folks we have

493
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,360
the ability to test let's say 75 of the

494
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,100
post-exploitation techniques the

495
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,200
attackers would use today it's not a

496
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,280
hundred

497
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,640
but you know what for me as an attacker

498
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,559
you have shut down 75 percent of the

499
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,900
doors that are open to me and more

500
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,960
importantly I don't even know what doors

501
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,419
you've closed until I've gone up and

502
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,360
I've tried to Rattle the door handle so

503
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,980
let's start shutting down those doors

504
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,240
and looking at vulnerability Management

505
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
in a fundamentally different way let's

506
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,260
not look at the mandent report of the

507
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,539
Verizon report of what this attack group

508
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,280
did and saying we got to protect against

509
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,960
these 15 things that's what we need to

510
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,340
protect against let's get to the point

511
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,360
where we can start testing and

512
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,559
evaluating all of those post

513
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,320
exploitation techniques on a regular and

514
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,380
continuous basis because I want I don't

515
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,460
know if you know this but he has another

516
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,100
company a great company called Grim they

517
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,320
do pen testing and like they're pen

518
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,179
testers just so you know they're good

519
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,000
trust me they're really really good we

520
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,559
have pen testing companies you know what

521
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,260
we want our jobs to be harder

522
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,360
because I know his team I know his team

523
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,179
really well those guys love a challenge

524
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,360
I know my team really well we hate it

525
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,039
when we get on site and we're like oh

526
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,539
God damn it another group policy

527
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,720
preference file again no we like the

528
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
novel stuff we like the new stuff we

529
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,799
like exploring identifying new

530
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,480
vulnerabilities we don't want to keep

531
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,580
reporting on the same garbage and we can

532
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,080
easily take care of a lot of those

533
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,580
vulnerabilities today because where

534
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,260
you're pushing the commercial pen tester

535
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,780
to be novel you've push the attacker to

536
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,179
have to spend money

537
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,860
so you threw two questions at me I'm

538
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,240
gonna go back to yeah go to that to the

539
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,520
first one so how much money do we spend

540
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,679
on threat intelligence

541
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,100
as an industry we spend 10 billion

542
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,720
dollars a year

543
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,840
are you getting 10 billion dollars worth

544
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,240
of Defense what is it's in the name

545
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,740
right it's supposed to be intelligence

546
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,020
it's supposed to get me in the loop

547
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,240
where I can make decisions around them

548
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,220
and intelligence basically comes in two

549
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,860
forms most of that money

550
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,760
is giving you stale iocs this is a bad

551
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,700
IP this is a bad domain this is a bad

552
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,980
hash file

553
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,820
what have you done

554
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,620
told me yesterday to get to tomorrow

555
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,720
so I spend a whole bunch of time solving

556
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,980
yesterday

557
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,860
the attacker is already in that Loop how

558
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,559
hard is it to change a file to give a

559
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,000
different hash value anybody know

560
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,820
if I add a zero to a file did I just

561
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,460
change the hash value

562
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,740
here can add a zero to any file

563
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,360
congratulations just now just made a

564
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,160
defensive bypass

565
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,200
you have just defeated 10 billion

566
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,660
dollars worth of engineering

567
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,120
you think I'm kidding

568
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,379
that is all of it

569
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,299
and here's the best part yesterday's a

570
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,880
metaphor how old and stale is that data

571
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,059
actually

572
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,120
it could be 50 years right

573
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,679
the second part of threat intelligence

574
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,140
right is the fancy mandated report

575
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,140
they are phenomenal well-researched 40

576
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,720
to 60 page opuses of Brilliance and I'm

577
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,039
not being facetious they are good

578
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,200
they're not being facetious they are

579
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,900
fantastic but what does it take for you

580
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,520
to take that report and bring it into

581
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,500
your environment anyone figured that one

582
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,400
out

583
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,320
I would love to know if you have figured

584
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,700
that out because that that's a million

585
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,380
dollar idea right there I am going to

586
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,240
say one group that's different is sisa

587
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,179
when sisa releases their alerts you go

588
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,919
down to the bottom they list out the

589
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,320
actual techniques that were used so that

590
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,820
leads me to another question talking

591
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,320
about a value of a 10 billion dollar

592
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,940
industry

593
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,380
um I want you all to think in your head

594
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,080
how much you spend on threat Intel feeds

595
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,360
that are specific like iocs like the IP

596
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,780
address the hash values and URLs domain

597
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,400
names whatever

598
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,059
for all of those threat techniques

599
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,980
how many of them are completely unique

600
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,400
and not documented already in miter

601
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,100
let me repeat that let's say you spend a

602
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,659
hundred thousand dollars

603
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,179
and they give you a hundred thousand

604
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,179
techniques that attackers are using what

605
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,640
percentage of those techniques are

606
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,419
already mapped to a documented technique

607
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,700
that you can get for free in miter

608
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,659
99 would be my guess

609
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,380
let's go look at it

610
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,840
you had this yeah so first here's the

611
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,340
question so we are spending that much

612
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,620
money

613
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,500
why because it's convenient

614
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,679
those stale iocs machine readable right

615
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,100
into your EDR right into a fire which I

616
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,360
also want to point out though a lot of

617
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,700
the companies they write signatures for

618
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,679
their AV for their EDR they write

619
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,780
signatures for their firewalls they

620
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,520
write signatures for their web proxies

621
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,440
and then they take it and then they

622
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,080
repackage the damn things and then they

623
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,240
sell it back to you as an ioc feeder

624
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,120
because your antivirus is already doing

625
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,179
threat Intel feeds your firewall is

626
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,000
already doing threat Intel feeds they

627
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,740
literally just found a creative way to

628
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,659
upsell you to buy the same thing that

629
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,880
you've already purchased

630
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,299
so moving on to vulnerability management

631
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,440
one

632
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,780
vulnerabilities are inevitable I have

633
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,760
yet to ever find a piece of code that

634
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,440
didn't have a bug

635
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,140
doesn't exist never will exist and

636
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,700
here's the kicker

637
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,620
doesn't even matter

638
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,260
what percent of access is actually

639
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,820
coming from exploitation of a

640
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,080
vulnerability

641
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,520
oh

642
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,100
right isn't that what Cushing is doing I

643
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,380
just I just wanted to use that yeah I

644
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,940
deserve that but it was obviously that I

645
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,700
was using sarcastically oh she's got you

646
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,980
so fishing in which all of the stupid

647
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,860
names they all fall under fishing all

648
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,120
right we can all agree that here right

649
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,980
we will never use some stupid Smith

650
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,960
inquishing whoever the right it's

651
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,960
all fishing okay fishing right it is it

652
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,799
uses a computer the way the computer was

653
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,200
designed to be used right turns out

654
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,559
that's the best way in

655
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:30,179
it's the best way in right they'll just

656
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,919
open the door for you that's actually

657
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,360
one of the funniest things I've ever

658
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,039
seen in getting access is like you're

659
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,419
having trouble getting something to run

660
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,460
and you call the the end user and you're

661
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,840
like hey you know I'm not getting the

662
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,039
Callback of course you don't phrase it

663
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,000
that way you're like you know they're

664
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
like we're trying I'm trying to get this

665
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,820
thing to run that I sent you like and

666
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,440
they're they're like arguing with the IT

667
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,419
team to whitelist you have you ever seen

668
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,280
that sorry a loud List have you ever

669
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,780
done that and they're like they're like

670
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,340
arguing with the team like no let me in

671
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,320
like let them do it like the user is

672
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,659
your best friend as an attacker they

673
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,580
want to help you they're there to do

674
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,840
that but so here's the thing about

675
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,820
vulnerabilities

676
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,820
you're spending all this money on people

677
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,120
process and Technology to build the

678
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,360
proverbial defense in depth right no

679
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,000
system lives in isolation

680
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,380
there are systems that are internet

681
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,600
facing and you should probably have a

682
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,919
little bit more of a critical eye to

683
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,740
those but most of the systems in your

684
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,620
stack are not internet facing

685
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,220
they have a different risk profile and

686
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,080
surface area

687
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,200
so what does cbss do today

688
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,080
some nerds somewhere in isolation tell

689
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,799
me a number

690
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,120
how many of you

691
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,559
have seen your place that once it's a

692
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,640
certain number you are required to

693
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,640
address the vulnerability yep how much

694
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,140
of that do you actually think is helping

695
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,120
you do you have any idea

696
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,220
no idea right because you're not getting

697
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,039
any context for it every day the great

698
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,080
machine spits out a list of ten thousand

699
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,000
things that you need to go fix

700
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,380
Oh by itself right there's no context

701
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,140
for it you need the system of systems

702
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,059
perspective hey isn't that what a red

703
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,440
team does

704
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,840
problem is can we afford a red team to

705
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,580
go and look at 10 000 things on a daily

706
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,580
basis we can't I hope you can and if you

707
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,700
can I'll take your business card

708
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,020
if you have that budget

709
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,039
budget for either of us are going to

710
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,840
need us both work with you we're happy

711
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,640
we charge half as much in certain

712
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,320
situations because we care twice as much

713
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,600
folks so so there's two aspects to this

714
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,059
right there's the inside aspect of can I

715
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,880
get a system of systems view where is my

716
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,100
investment in defense stacking up

717
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,620
against that list and then there's the

718
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,020
external part which is what is that

719
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,580
exploitability right I would argue

720
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,440
that's a pseudoscience because there are

721
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,240
places that are like we know how much

722
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,220
that's being exploited in the wild well

723
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,320
how are you doing that we're on the dark

724
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,159
web have you heard of it

725
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,900
you laugh but procurement will roll over

726
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,520
with six digits when you say dark web

727
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,380
you rub their belly they like yeah

728
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,360
they're just like dark web right by the

729
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,820
ears that's 200 Grand I always wonder

730
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,380
what people think the dark web is it's

731
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,380
like the Cantina on Tatooine yeah all

732
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,940
the hackers get together and it's like

733
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,039
Bryson so today I was thinking about

734
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,620
hacking General Electric I think we're

735
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,640
gonna be hacking General Electric

736
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,400
tomorrow at 2PM and like these you know

737
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,620
they're like got him got him GE they're

738
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,659
gonna attack tomorrow at two are you

739
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,840
Paul Revere good god

740
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,340
oh no they're they're they're disclosing

741
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,600
all the vulnerabilities that I'm about

742
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,100
to go in all those exploits they share

743
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,860
the exploits we just share them freely

744
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,220
dark web Legacy IRC

745
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,340
no it's because it's text-based still

746
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,520
all right so one of the things that I

747
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,620
also wanted to ask you about like this

748
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,240
vulnerability management

749
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,279
is the place that EDR has come into like

750
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,400
how many of you do offensive operations

751
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,260
yeah let's let's be honest edrs are

752
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,520
getting good

753
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,799
they are getting really good and there

754
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,480
was a handful of people that sounded the

755
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,059
alarm on this a long long time ago and

756
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,740
they're like EDR is going to continue to

757
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,120
get better

758
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,940
so my question to you is if I have a

759
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,380
good EDR and I'm going to let Bryson

760
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,659
answer but a question to everybody if I

761
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,960
have a good EDR that stops activation I

762
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,159
don't need to test that other stuff

763
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,440
right so like if I run Atomic red team

764
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,240
and it kills the Powershell from

765
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,520
executing then I am immune to everything

766
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,620
from you know Atomic red team or

767
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,480
Powershell Empire or size I downloaded

768
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,480
oh it didn't run we're good we stopped

769
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,419
them right there is that a good way to

770
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,740
be looking at things because I know you

771
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,480
and I have talked about it a lot where

772
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,220
we have customers like we caught your

773
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,799
implant therefore we're completely

774
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,200
secure from that point on yeah I mean I

775
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,360
think that goes back to

776
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,640
um an industry psychology that I saw

777
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,640
even before edrs got that good where you

778
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,279
you've got the the Arrogant customer who

779
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,480
hires your red team and you're like

780
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,820
you're not going to get in

781
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,100
it's like what is that prove okay right

782
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,020
you paid me for one week's worth of work

783
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,880
so you hired me because I kind of sucked

784
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,620
you kind of rolled the dice on how much

785
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,179
I've been able to do in a week with that

786
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:13,799
scope or two weeks with that scope right

787
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,720
you you want to give me six months and

788
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,299
pay me to like work like a real apt then

789
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,000
let's talk right so it's it's a scope

790
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,799
it's it's a luck there's there's like

791
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,140
all these factors into what that might

792
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,640
have told you right the other thing is

793
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,059
like real attackers try and fail try and

794
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,220
fail they fish they fail they fish they

795
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,380
fail they fish they succeed they get

796
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,419
execution they get caught they modify

797
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,159
they're constantly changing their

798
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,020
tactivation like you said they have a

799
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,240
lot more time than we have like a red

800
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,520
team where you get like three fishes at

801
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,320
an environment that are all approved and

802
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,440
it's like we want is a UPS uh FedEx one

803
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,000
and then

804
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,720
um I don't know maybe uh maybe free shoe

805
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,100
vouchers those are the only ones we're

806
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,720
going to allow in the attackers aren't

807
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,880
dealing with those constraints ever yep

808
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,799
and so most of the time what you're

809
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,419
getting with the red team is is a

810
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,940
snapshot in time a successful red team

811
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,919
was a snapshot that is inherently

812
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,080
Limited in scope it's limited in

813
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,620
resource time and the scope of which you

814
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,080
can test right you've all heard the joke

815
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,580
right well that's out of scoping right

816
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,140
nothing is out of scope to an attacker

817
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,700
so you've already made that limitation

818
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,980
but here's the other thing does any red

819
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,899
team have the resources to go against

820
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:28,020
end computers in an environment no we

821
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,740
don't

822
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,380
we typically go kind of from one to five

823
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,320
and that's the best sort of focus on so

824
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,539
how much did I get out of that taking in

825
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,640
fact again it's just a snapshot in time

826
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,620
to a business in an organization where

827
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,559
everything is constantly changing

828
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,840
uh quick uh quick anecdote on red

829
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,279
teaming that I think is really funny do

830
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,200
you know the most common reason that red

831
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,840
team fish don't work

832
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,299
they're over engineered

833
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,000
they're too good and it sticks out

834
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,640
they're like they put effort into this

835
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,679
this is not an actual fish okay okay

836
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,919
look so years ago I I did a fish and I'm

837
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,539
horrible at spelling I've made this

838
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,760
clear that seriously those work Google

839
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,399
literally sometimes thinks oh you're

840
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,080
writing in French I'm going to change

841
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,779
your language

842
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:18,419
I'm that bad I am and like my fish has

843
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,220
worked really really well liberal arts

844
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,860
major I know I am but oh God that's a

845
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,799
long he's actually a liberal arts major

846
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,720
poli-side baby yeah

847
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,520
um thanks

848
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,559
um there's one here we'll make each

849
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,059
other coffee later because that's what

850
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,500
our skills were oh

851
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,580
actually I feel pretty good about asking

852
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,200
that question since I bought fries and

853
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,620
burgers for everyone here

854
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,480
um but it actually worked really well

855
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,279
and the other thing that is interesting

856
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,740
talking about this whenever I write an

857
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,080
email for a webcast it has a higher

858
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,080
successful deployment rating than if I

859
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,880
have somebody else who is actually good

860
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,100
at English writing our emails talking

861
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,840
about our webcast that's coming up next

862
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,419
week just because mine read really

863
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:04,919
horrible it goes through the filters

864
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,200
with you it comes across as authentic

865
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,640
but when you're looking at the real

866
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,520
world with phishing right everyone here

867
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,500
has seen the proverbial Nigerian scam

868
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,940
email right

869
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,620
why are they so bad

870
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,520
what's that

871
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,279
nope

872
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,320
they speak the queen's English perfectly

873
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,299
I would actually argue every one of

874
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,159
those people who writes fish speaks

875
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,600
better English than any one of us in

876
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,340
this room because they actually know the

877
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,140
rules of grammar and like anyone here

878
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,880
know what a conjunction is like I

879
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,159
don't know

880
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:40,380
I'm already lost right clue perfect yeah

881
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,260
right they do it on purpose they

882
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,659
intentionally craft that horrible email

883
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,279
he does it on accident because he can't

884
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,260
help himself they're doing it on purpose

885
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,760
why

886
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,299
anyone know why

887
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:56,100
what selecting your target selecting

888
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,899
your target your target self-selects

889
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,720
right the kind of person that thinks I'm

890
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,220
going to next give you my social

891
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,140
security number because you're the

892
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,940
dearest beloved Nigerian prince trying

893
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,240
to get 20 billion gold pounds of bullion

894
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,740
out of a rock

895
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,360
is it idiot

896
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:18,000
so if they read that email and still

897
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,480
believe that they have told me I am your

898
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,880
target the rest of us if we're doing it

899
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,980
we're trolls we're gonna waste their

900
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,779
time they don't want to waste the time

901
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,480
they want the money so they write an

902
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,480
email that is so bad itself selects red

903
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,799
teams have this problem because they're

904
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,019
over engineering it the best fish in the

905
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,539
real world that work are the garbage

every employee Falls for that maybe this

908
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,480
is a failure of capitalist Society we're

909
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,919
not paying our people enough I don't

910
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,380
know but it works we had one this is

911
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,760
horrible

912
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,360
we had one where this this company did a

913
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,179
charity run with a shoe company and we

914
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,220
sent a fish in pretending to be the shoe

915
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,120
company

916
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,559
and we said hey we're going to give you

917
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,639
all 50 Off Shoes click here and they it

918
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,739
worked great because they just did it a

919
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:13,918
month ago and it was timely and it was

920
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,899
great the shoe company calls us up and

921
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,899
they're like what the hell are you doing

922
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:20,399
customer support our customer support

923
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,918
department is very angry at us please

924
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,020
stop so we stopped and then we did the

925
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,780
debriefing and I'm on go to webinar and

926
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,060
I'm debriefing to the entire company

927
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,520
what we did we researched that you guys

928
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,879
all did a run it was a charity and we

929
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,260
basically said that you know we would

930
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,239
use that because it was timely and it

931
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,899
worked so we created this fake attack

932
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:44,760
explained the entire thing in intense

933
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,800
detail and I said does anybody have any

934
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,080
questions and the questions were all

935
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,159
well when are we going to get our shoes

936
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,980
my 50 off discount coupon code did not

937
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,099
work when will you make this work for me

938
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,320
and I'm just like okay let's do this

939
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,640
again

940
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,160
um it was a fish I'm trying to attack

941
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,339
yeah yeah yeah but I have these shoes

942
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,820
that I want it was uh we we've opted not

943
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,560
to use that ruse again just because the

944
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,900
customer support issues were that bad so

945
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,000
this this leads to

946
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,940
um I I have a bit of a

947
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,980
controversial opinion I think fishing

948
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,020
training is a waste of time

949
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,220
is a waste of time

950
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,020
it's okay it's not golf

951
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,839
I agree or no

952
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,579
but either way like

953
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,260
I'm open to feed back we can argue about

954
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,400
it

955
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,200
um and the story that really

956
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,020
encapsulates this for me because our

957
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,420
industry these Executives right are are

958
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,940
trying to act like grown-ups to the like

959
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,320
actual grown-ups you know the business

960
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,060
the whole reason the organization exists

961
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,160
and that organization has everything

962
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,440
down to right well profit and loss and

963
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,119
this is how much Day sales outstanding

964
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,640
they have all these metrics with numbers

965
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,260
where are our metrics with numbers in

966
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,780
our space

967
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,160
they're all made up

968
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,140
and so we like fishing training because

969
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,180
it gives us statistics that make us feel

970
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,400
like we're solving the problem and I'll

971
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,020
never forget this this is like four or

972
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,700
five years ago I'm talking to the CSO

973
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,220
and he was so excited to share this like

974
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,380
success story with me and he's like you

975
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,420
know what we started this well first

976
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,680
line we got our Baseline right because

977
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,420
with metrics it's all about a baseline I

978
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,460
need a number to compare and that's the

979
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,920
success and my initial number was 32

980
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,280
clicked on that initial campaign

981
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,680
we did phishing training we spent money

982
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,140
we did webinars and afterward we got

983
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,279
down to 27 percent

984
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,180
and I was like

985
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,859
what have you what'd you accomplish and

986
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:44,820
he kind of looks at me and he's like

987
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,040
didn't you get it like five percent like

988
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,060
I was like it only takes one fish

989
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,740
one fish

990
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,540
that's all I ever need if it's ever

991
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,280
above zero

992
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,020
game over man

993
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,160
he's like

994
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,240
oh

995
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,700
he was so defeated right because he he

996
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,040
found the statistic fishing training

997
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,660
gave him a number he could call to and

998
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,040
go to the business and be like I am

999
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,540
investing money and I am solving a

1000
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,700
problem except he's not solving the

1001
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,040
problem the reason fishing Works besides

1002
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,500
users using users the computers the way

1003
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,820
it was designed

1004
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,780
foreign

1005
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,060
how much does it cost for me to send one

1006
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,280
fish versus me to send 10 million fish

1007
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,099
it is a negligible cost difference right

1008
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,720
and that's why what's the best your

1009
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,760
threat intelligence is going to do let's

1010
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,920
block that domain

1011
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,660
and let's block that domain

1012
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,099
and I can keep doing that over and over

1013
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,320
again and I will get in

1014
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,420
business email compromise

1015
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,160
I'm fishing you from somebody you

1016
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,140
already know and trust or you look like

1017
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,540
somebody I know on trust well but yeah

1018
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,820
in their accounts it's Barbara who sends

1019
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,000
you at 9am the Excel document of the

1020
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
inventory with a macro every Monday

1021
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,040
morning at 9.

1022
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,140
or they ask for the Excel spreadsheet

1023
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,359
with the macros yeah send that back to

1024
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,579
me yes here you go

1025
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,460
so you know I I I I still think that we

1026
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,220
should do fishing assessments I do and

1027
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,839
and I think that part of it it should be

1028
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,359
not targeting the users per se but

1029
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,800
making sure that the technical controls

1030
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,900
are working for example what type of

1031
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,579
attachments do you allow through right

1032
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,320
everyone's like oh okay we'll be allowed

1033
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,420
we allow word docs and it sells

1034
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,520
spreadsheets and yeah we block

1035
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,099
executables and zip files and raw files

1036
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,599
okay yeah we block those things that's

1037
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,520
good so I got a question how many that

1038
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,560
don't answer this

1039
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,720
but how many of your organizations allow

1040
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,300
dot RDP files through

1041
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,400
how do you know if you've been on our

1042
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,960
webcast many of you have already shut

1043
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,180
that down but we came up with a

1044
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,540
technique that dot RDP files are allowed

1045
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,260
through almost any email provider and

1046
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,060
it's a we're back to a one-click

1047
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,400
compromise all it takes is someone to

1048
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,260
click a DOT RDP file and we get access

1049
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,760
onto their computer system in its

1050
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,960
instant

1051
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,700
that's the type of testing that we

1052
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,500
should be doing is seeing what is

1053
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,700
allowed through what are the different

1054
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,079
techniques that are allowed through at

1055
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,640
least getting a better understanding so

1056
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,619
when an attack happens we have a better

1057
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:11,400
understanding of what our

1058
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,020
vulnerabilities are in our risk profile

1059
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,940
for that is validate the technical

1060
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,220
controls around the users and here's the

1061
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,560
thing there are different user groups in

1062
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,240
the business so one of the easiest

1063
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,980
things that I point out is the most the

1064
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,099
my favorite fishing Target is recruiting

1065
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,660
recruiting's entire job is to interact

1066
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,000
with strangers they don't know opening

1067
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,500
attaching nothing but junkies and

1068
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,880
needles man nothing but junkies and

1069
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,740
needles how can you solve that well

1070
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,900
maybe we don't have recruiting work

1071
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,339
directly with everybody through email

1072
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,220
maybe we have all of those things go

1073
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,260
through a portal and now I've changed

1074
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,720
the risk profile around a high access

1075
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,720
user group and then I can validate that

1076
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,760
right so stop punishing the users

1077
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,980
understand the users and go to meet them

1078
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,900
on their terms and bring the technical

1079
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,359
Firepower to where they are and how they

1080
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,579
work make their lives easier to make

1081
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,700
your lives easier so I I got okay so

1082
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,859
here's oh this gentleman has a question

1083
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,380
what what about measuring the report

1084
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,240
rates that people get when you send them

1085
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,560
fishes though like what percentage of

1086
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,200
people report it as a fishing yes that's

1087
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,660
so that's good right so this has been

1088
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,400
this has been one of the changes that

1089
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,079
has happened in certain parts of the

1090
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,020
industry the question was what about the

1091
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,780
reports on employees reporting a

1092
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,160
campaign

1093
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,740
right

1094
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,079
so we've now changed our users into

1095
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,119
being intelligence sensors

1096
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,240
that's good thing right we want our

1097
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,980
users to work with us we want them to be

1098
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,320
Champions contributing to the solution

1099
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,820
as opposed to just being part of the

1100
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,520
problem that 100 yes so in that case I'm

1101
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,079
not training you on phishing I'm

1102
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,820
training you on how to report the

1103
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,980
process right and now you're working

1104
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,260
with me that's what I'm training you on

1105
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,000
so I've got a question for you you know

1106
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,560
we're talking about risk profiles and

1107
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,000
phishing and things like that how many

1108
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,740
of your organizations actually restrict

1109
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,300
access to the internet not talking

1110
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,579
denial listing but allow listing going

1111
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,560
into your filters and looking for

1112
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,079
uncategorized and blocking it basically

1113
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,060
saying if it's never seen this domain

1114
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,859
it's never seen this website don't let

1115
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:12,180
your users go there how many of you are

1116
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,220
doing that now awesome all right that's

1117
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,960
a good number how many of you are

1118
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,700
terrified to do that in your environment

1119
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,920
because your users will Revolt because

1120
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,320
they can't get to the Internet so stick

1121
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,359
with me on this let's say you blocked

1122
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,240
access to the internet your users revolt

1123
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,859
don't they all have a magic internet

1124
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,780
device for personal surfing in their

1125
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,140
pocket

1126
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,380
we can change the way that we look at

1127
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,960
the threat landscape and something as

1128
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,480
simple as like locking off a huge

1129
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,579
portion of the internet and saying you

1130
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,020
know what if Cisco umbrella has never

1131
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,119
seen this website you probably don't

1132
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,579
want your users going there that's okay

1133
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,920
and there may be complaints well I can't

1134
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,599
get to the social website I can't get to

1135
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,940
my kids uh College grades or whatever

1136
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,339
that's why we have these things in our

1137
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,140
pockets and I think it's like what

1138
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,460
you're talking about

1139
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,920
changing the metric and changing the

1140
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,440
thought process and saying you are going

1141
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,260
to be measured by how many campaigns you

1142
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,960
detect and you turn in is a fundamental

1143
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,180
change in the way that we think and the

1144
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,220
way our users think changing the way

1145
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,440
that you look at how we do casual web

1146
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,960
surfing is this is the magic device that

1147
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,240
we do casual web surfing and this is a

1148
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,220
cultural change by the way

1149
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,140
because many people like to surf the

1150
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,060
Internet from their computer because it

1151
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,460
looks a lot like work right like I'm

1152
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,500
sitting here doing this it's just alt

1153
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,520
Tab and all of a sudden I got a

1154
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,960
spreadsheet up right you can make it

1155
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,060
look that way maybe not being so hard if

1156
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,380
you come into somebody's Cube and

1157
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,700
they're on their phone and thinking well

1158
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,760
Bill's not working changing the way that

1159
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,980
we look at it I saw Jason Blanchard go

1160
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,200
through one of the customers that he did

1161
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,619
back doors and breaches years ago they

1162
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,180
changed the way that they referenced

1163
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,160
passwords where if anybody called up and

1164
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,599
they said hey I need to change my

1165
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,400
password they would immediately say

1166
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,619
great I'm happy to help you change your

1167
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,319
passphrase today

1168
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:06,660
changing just like little imperceptible

1169
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,060
changes in the way that we measure and

1170
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,220
the way that we restrict but still allow

1171
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,200
people to do things changing the way

1172
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,880
that they look at passwords versus past

1173
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,819
phrases can have a monstrous change in

1174
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,040
the overall security of an organization

1175
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,020
who works in an operational technology

1176
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,520
or industrial control system environment

1177
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,720
do any of you

1178
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,720
you do okay so

1179
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,400
that's harder to do sometimes right

1180
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,980
right you're almost like going over like

1181
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,859
across like that boundary it's like

1182
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,060
being in a different country you know

1183
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,859
what I mean and you sort of like you

1184
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:40,500
show up with the donuts be like let me

1185
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,599
you're gonna can I can I take can we can

1186
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,859
we take that right

1187
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,140
they know and they know they intimidate

1188
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,900
you too right because they they are

1189
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,700
usually large physical people who are

1190
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,260
like I will you up with the lead

1191
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,160
Pike you think I'm kidding am I kidding

1192
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,560
nope

1193
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,819
I'm not kidding

1194
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:03,119
and those folks you can they the

1195
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,160
computers are like the fun thing that's

1196
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,079
around right most of them they're their

1197
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,000
their world is physical maintenance

1198
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,819
right I turn wrenches there just happens

1199
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,160
to be a computer there now this is new

1200
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,660
right you want to understand operational

1201
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,880
technology look at where we were in I.T

1202
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,460
20 years ago that's where they are today

1203
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,700
but that point about going to your phone

1204
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,660
most of the time they're not allowed to

1205
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,800
have phones because it's not going to

1206
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,300
fit with their protective equipment so

1207
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,520
they're not that's not an option and

1208
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,640
these folks are the worst violators

1209
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,339
I will I will share a story anonymously

1210
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,160
of an example right so when you're

1211
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,660
working the night shift there you pretty

1212
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,859
much sit there with all your little

1213
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:43,800
dials and you got nothing to do

1214
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,780
just watch the dials right it's like

1215
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,040
Homer Simpson right he's just sitting

1216
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,420
there he's like don't go to the red and

1217
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,920
if it goes to the red

1218
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,220
do something right it's a lot of time

1219
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,440
so what do you do when you are most

1220
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,380
often of the male species and you got

1221
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,480
nothing but time on your hands with

1222
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,460
internet access

1223
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,800
what is on most of the internet

1224
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,660
what do you think it is it's not trick

1225
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,359
question posting on Twitter porn oh

1226
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,599
oh now is there a relationship between

1227
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:15,440
porn and malware

1228
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,599
wishful thinking don't make it so

1229
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,660
heavily laced with malware and uh this

1230
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,060
place actually uh what porn are you

1231
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,119
serving yeah

1232
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,400
he's got a very good stuff I have this

1233
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,540
vision of like oh oh that's a wrap oh we

1234
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,500
got a no op sled yes

1235
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:45,540
all the way down all the way down oh I'm

1236
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,980
the only person who can ever make him

1237
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,200
blush

1238
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,700
so here's how they tried to solve this

1239
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,800
there was a there was a governmental

1240
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,260
um component to this and the government

1241
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,440
actually created a curated safe porn

1242
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,400
library for them

1243
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,619
you think this is funny I know of a U.S

1244
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:11,640
asset owner

1245
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,800
not too many states away from here that

1246
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,380
just last week had this same problem

1247
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,900
and HR got involved and it was an HR

1248
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,700
issue because I.T security couldn't stop

1249
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,040
him again going in there they're like oh

1250
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,440
like I've got the Vaseline in this hand

1251
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,760
I got the pipe in this hand you're not

1252
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,920
taking this away from me and so the only

1253
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,240
way they could solve it was through an

1254
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,859
HR response

1255
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:33,839
these these are your user bases right

1256
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,300
that's the business

1257
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,460
you are subject you can't just take the

1258
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,020
internet away right you can't just say

1259
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,160
we're going to go to an allowed list

1260
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,339
only right we do recognize that yes that

1261
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:45,599
certainly is going to be reducing your

1262
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,339
surface area but it is very much

1263
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,380
understanding the particular culture

1264
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,420
where you are I want to point out that's

1265
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,060
a very small Edge case like I'm willing

1266
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,460
to bet for oh

1267
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,500
you're going on that everyone is there a

1268
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,020
pun now phrasing are we still doing that

1269
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,940
is that still amazing

1270
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,920
um I think get it out if we're dealing

1271
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,980
with like you know a point one percent

1272
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,780
that we're actually providing porn to

1273
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,119
our employees that's not let's not

1274
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,819
create policies around that okay I'm not

1275
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:16,560
offering that up as a mainstream okay

1276
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,260
I'm just saying it is an example of that

1277
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,940
is the real world that's out there right

1278
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,240
and like so I I really resent and I

1279
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,619
think most of us do when you see the

1280
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,359
experts get up on stage and they're like

1281
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,420
you need to be doing zero trust it's so

1282
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,220
easy you know what you do you just

1283
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,380
segment everything

1284
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,420
how much of a pain in the ass is that

1285
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,640
for me to maintain that segmentation do

1286
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,500
I have to buy additional licenses do I

1287
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,180
now have to apply patches now that I

1288
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,380
can't do remotely now I have to

1289
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,520
physically go over there and do that

1290
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,800
right also when I'm segmenting I'm

1291
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,300
changing how somebody's actually doing

1292
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,819
their job right so I also blame Auditors

1293
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,680
for that I also blame Auditors for that

1294
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,260
and here sorry sorry dude

1295
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,000
um

1296
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,099
a lot of Auditors

1297
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:00,140
thank you for your service

1298
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,339
a lot of otters like whenever we talk

1299
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,380
about segmentation like we go in and

1300
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,460
we're like yeah you guys should say man

1301
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,960
they're like well how do we do that we

1302
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,460
can set up jump posts or authorized

1303
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,900
hosts post patches you can put in the

1304
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,280
different filters you just want to make

1305
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,020
sure that your user population can't get

1306
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,880
to OT they can't get to the credit card

1307
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,560
data they can't get to here and then an

1308
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,560
auditor comes in they're like no nothing

1309
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,060
can be allowed between these two

1310
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,859
networks this network needs to be

1311
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,720
completely isolated from the entire

1312
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,060
internet and you're like okay cool how

1313
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,859
do I patch it they're like well

1314
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:31,560
uh well you manually have the patches

1315
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,540
well I have 400 different types of

1316
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,579
software you expect me to put it on a

1317
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,500
USB I'm sorry I keep looking over at you

1318
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,180
and I apologize you're just you're my

1319
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,819
straw auditor and I apologize for that

1320
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:45,240
and it sucks because I think that you

1321
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,280
know a lot of the people that do

1322
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,980
auditing and security testing once again

1323
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,119
they're like people sitting at like

1324
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,380
thought leaders sitting at the front of

1325
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,180
a room they basically come up with these

1326
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,440
dictates and they say this is what

1327
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,359
you're going to do and anything you do

1328
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,640
to try to explain what you're doing is

1329
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,319
automatically shut down and they

1330
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:02,880
automatically are like well that's not

1331
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,680
something I understand so we're going to

1332
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,940
basically say that this is an audit

1333
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,980
finding we have to have people in the

1334
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,119
industry that are a little bit more

1335
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,740
intelligent can kind of understand once

1336
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,420
again going back to the point the attack

1337
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,579
path right what is the actual attack

1338
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,200
path that somebody could go through what

1339
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,460
are all the different Gates what are the

1340
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,780
different ways that we have it assessed

1341
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,640
because honestly at the end of the day

1342
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,960
our

1343
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,599
military an intelligence Community is

1344
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:27,780
running on spark 9 systems trust me I

1345
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,980
know where they're at I've seen the

1346
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,020
systems they're still there our entire

1347
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,480
Financial system from many banks is

1348
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,780
still running on as 400 computer systems

1349
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,940
so if we want to sit here and we want to

1350
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,619
say no everything must be patched no

1351
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,060
everything must be up to date no

1352
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,520
everything must be segmented that's not

1353
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,200
the way the world actually works and I

1354
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,400
think it requires us to come up with

1355
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,900
some Creative Solutions that aren't so

1356
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,359
necessarily binary of yes it's

1357
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,579
completely segmented or no it's not

1358
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:55,680
segmented well that goes right back into

1359
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,359
the system of systems respective we're

1360
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,140
out of vulnerability right we are not in

1361
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,940
the practice of stopping risk right we

1362
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,819
mitigate risk right we use an

1363
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,040
intelligent approach to saying we

1364
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,440
understand this problem here's what we

1365
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,140
think about that and then the business

1366
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,119
accepts the residual risk as much as we

1367
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,800
understand it

1368
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,200
that's what we do there is no I have

1369
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,180
stopped risk that's the whole reason

1370
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,099
that segmentation exists is because we

1371
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,220
have this theory that an air gap stops

1372
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,359
risk

1373
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:33,839
has anybody ever seen a real air gap

1374
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,760
you have seen an actual air gap tell me

1375
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,140
how it was actually air gapped and

1376
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,220
nothing ever touched it ever

1377
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,099
so it is you do the sneaker net cool

1378
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:47,339
right yours what do you got yeah cool so

1379
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:48,780
when I was working at Department of

1380
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,480
Defense um I was working at the uh at

1381
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,980
the nro I can actually say that

1382
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,440
organization now which is neat and we

1383
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,819
had a whole bunch of network stops our

1384
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:58,500
program special access programs that

1385
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,059
were supposed to be isolated from the

1386
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:01,800
classified networks and we went through

1387
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,780
and we did a test to see what was the

1388
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,760
connectivity between the different

1389
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,680
networks so if you want from like zipper

1390
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,760
and Nipper and all these different

1391
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,380
classified networks they were all

1392
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,240
supposed to be completely air gapped

1393
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,460
completely isolated and we found

1394
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,099
something like 85 different connections

1395
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:20,280
going to lower classification networks

1396
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,200
and we found 10 that were directly

1397
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,059
connected to the open internet

1398
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,400
and I remember flying out to DC and kind

1399
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,920
of walking through all of this and no

1400
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,200
one knew how they actually got there you

1401
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,339
know it was always something that was ad

1402
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,859
hoc it was put in for a specific case a

1403
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:36,359
general wanted it a congressperson

1404
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,280
wanted to have an internet terminal and

1405
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,780
they would send out these little boxes

1406
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,980
that would connect up to their home

1407
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,559
network and you can never really look at

1408
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,119
that stuff and you can say it's

1409
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,040
completely unless it's a small like you

1410
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,200
know small little device my favorite

1411
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,000
like air gap networks are some of the

1412
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,040
microwave relays that some of the power

1413
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,599
companies have anybody here work for a

1414
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,220
power company where they do

1415
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,400
point-to-point microwave dishes and like

1416
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,079
the only way in is you got to somehow

1417
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:02,819
intercept the microwave Communications

1418
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,440
which by the way

1419
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,160
don't do that that's a bad idea we

1420
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,599
actually saw points point we don't have

1421
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,839
children maybe you do want to do that my

1422
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,460
favorite point-to-point microwave story

1423
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,319
is the connection between Chicago and

1424
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,599
New York for financial services which is

1425
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,280
a completely different thing but the

1426
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,960
point is there's always these creative

1427
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,660
ways it's like Jurassic Park life will

1428
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,420
find a way the internet will find a way

1429
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,420
to permeate into an environment every

1430
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,300
single time so we have like a few

1431
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,400
minutes left

1432
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,480
yeah go ahead and wrap it up well

1433
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,220
anybody have any questions for us yeah

1434
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,599
questions are good we like questions

1435
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,819
we're friendly what's that government

1436
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:47,520
what's the government sanctions what's

1437
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,900
the government sanctioned porn site no

1438
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,240
it wasn't a God I got it you got a pen

1439
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,160
and paper

1440
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,619
whitehouse.com it's uh it's the

1441
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:57,500
government sanctioned.com

1442
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,880
Wikipedia I have worked a number of

1443
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,980
cases where people can only get to the

1444
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,140
Wikipedia and they were surfing porn on

1445
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,819
the week PD and I just want you to know

1446
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:07,980
if you're surfing porn on the Wikipedia

1447
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,200
it's like drinking Sterno you've hit

1448
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,420
rock bottom

1449
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,020
another question

1450
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,740
seeing what hit you like a week ago can

1451
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,960
be yeah until comes in it's like oh yeah

1452
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,660
we saw this hash last week it can be but

1453
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,980
once again I go back to tuning

1454
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,300
perspective you've already got that in

1455
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,740
your AV you've already got that in your

1456
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,119
firewall you've already got that in your

1457
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,619
web proxy you've already got that in a

1458
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:34,020
bunch of different devices if they are

1459
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,000
that far behind

1460
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,859
um you're in trouble so don't pay twice

1461
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:38,940
for something you're already paying for

1462
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,660
yep another question yeah so if I'm

1463
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,379
looking at

1464
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,900
yeah so first of all is um some of the

1465
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,520
reasons that folks hire independent

1466
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,960
companies is they need the letter of

1467
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,940
attestation and I will tell you as a

1468
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,220
vendor I am very particular about the

1469
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,540
scope of what I'm allowed to do before

1470
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,579
I'm willing to provide my name on saying

1471
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:15,960
I've actually done to something to a

1472
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,520
certain level that I feel confident it's

1473
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,140
the I think it's the second sentence in

1474
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,460
yours

1475
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,160
I think I think yours reads Grimm was

1476
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,900
hired to do an assessment this is a

1477
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,880
point in time yeah a statement I think

1478
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,460
it's the second sentence yeah

1479
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,680
um but the the biggest thing that I I

1480
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,900
think that you should look for is again

1481
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,720
what's show me past reports where you've

1482
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,339
anonymized make sure that they know how

1483
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:39,900
to anonymize because I've seen folks

1484
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,640
share reports that I've got data I

1485
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,260
should not have so if they can't do that

1486
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,200
then you shouldn't trust

1487
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,160
it's one of those things like it's so

1488
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,420
obvious you think you shouldn't have to

1489
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,160
ask the question but

1490
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,319
yeah it still happens

1491
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,880
um where they've shown context to

1492
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,260
whatever they're doing right I don't

1493
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,180
need you to be clever I need you to

1494
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,740
figure out can you show how you

1495
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,480
understood my business and everything

1496
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,180
you found was in the context of my

1497
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,300
business and then how good are you at

1498
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,760
actually giving me remedial guidance are

1499
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,859
you uh here's a large report throw it

1500
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:12,720
and you disappear or are you actually

1501
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,579
good at making it so even though you do

1502
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:15,720
go away because I don't want to pay for

1503
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,940
that I know I've got enough data to

1504
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,680
Faithfully be able to recreate what you

1505
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,940
did because that's how I'm going to

1506
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,220
prove I've solved it I'm also going to

1507
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,599
throw this out there the good firms

1508
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,400
they're out in the community

1509
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,900
the good firms are giving presentations

1510
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,640
good firms are running cons the good

1511
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,220
firms are sharing tools and techniques

1512
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,960
they're out there trying to make the

1513
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,940
community better and if you look at a

1514
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,319
firm that's constantly trying to make

1515
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:39,960
community at large better they're going

1516
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,200
to make your company better as well

1517
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,919
all right yeah

1518
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,540
or maybe we do whatever you support it

1519
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,059
but we don't maintain it or oh it's not

1520
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:59,099
so that's configuration management right

1521
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:00,780
I need to know who the assistant owner

1522
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,220
is I want to repeat the question real

1523
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,140
quick the question was accountability

1524
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,300
for vulnerability remediation how do you

1525
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,800
get people to do that yeah so

1526
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,540
configuration management is 80 of

1527
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,760
information security if it doesn't know

1528
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,380
who's in charge of the system what's the

1529
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,180
state of that system what are we going

1530
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,859
to do with security right we're going to

1531
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:18,420
be running around trying to gather data

1532
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,619
to try to figure out who am I painting

1533
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:21,240
the tail on after I already have work

1534
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,400
they need to be responsible for that

1535
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,400
asset prior or else we're just we're

1536
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,420
wasting our time it's a management

1537
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,400
problem it's politics and basically you

1538
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,540
need to have somebody in the company

1539
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,819
that is high enough up to drive it

1540
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:34,440
through and basically what that's

1541
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,599
telling me is security stops about mid

1542
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,640
management there's no one in like the

1543
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,160
CTO CSO level that actually has

1544
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,020
Authority and the power to drive it

1545
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,579
through across the organization

1546
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:49,079
the Cecil roll is so freshly baked into

1547
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,579
the organization that they don't really

1548
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,859
understand what to do with our

1549
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:54,720
recommendations and they have system

1550
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,760
owners so they know whose responsibility

1551
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,319
is but these are the higher level

1552
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,460
management they don't have it but you

1553
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,880
don't have the stick yeah

1554
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,680
your number one job as a Cisco and this

1555
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,720
is absolute honest to God truth when you

1556
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,240
get hired into a company as a ciso your

1557
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,160
number one job is to be the person to

1558
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,540
take the fall when the company gets

1559
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,839
hacked

1560
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:18,119
I think it's a little cynical that's

1561
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:19,980
that's that's that's the honest to God

1562
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,780
truth whenever you get on like boards

1563
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,880
directors you start listening to what

1564
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,880
they say it protects the CTO it protects

1565
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,000
the CEO it protects the CEO the CFO that

1566
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,220
is the insurance stop gap for the entire

1567
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,960
company and I talked to a lot of sussos

1568
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,819
that are like I'm in here I have no

1569
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,680
Authority I can't change anything no one

1570
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,960
listens to me you are literally there to

1571
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,460
be the sacrificial lamb to be taken

1572
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,140
outside the gates and Slaughter so the

1573
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,180
the the the reality to what he's saying

1574
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,680
is tied to the fact that we have now

1575
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,760
seen

1576
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,099
um regulation pushed down potential

1577
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,500
criminal and civil liability to

1578
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,540
organizations which means the CEO and

1579
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,520
the CFO as the executive financial

1580
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,500
officer on behalf of that organization

1581
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,319
have legal responsibilities for the stat

1582
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:04,140
the status of it and so the CSO is in

1583
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,540
that case basically the person on point

1584
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,300
for it the reality as as that kind of

1585
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,520
challenge is is fundamentally I.T

1586
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,940
security is a customer of tea right

1587
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,460
without them giving us the data right we

1588
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,160
get what most of us get which is hey we

1589
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,839
might have a pro or you typically find a

1590
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,280
problem and then you're like where does

1591
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,440
it apply

1592
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,420
and if they can't give that to you it's

1593
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,859
because you don't have the executive

1594
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:30,300
sponsorship where that is a natural

1595
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,040
float and there's that stick to make it

1596
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,619
happen so to me operationally a cso's

1597
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:36,660
whole job in practicality is to be the

1598
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,059
 umbrella for you to go get you the

1599
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:41,280
resources from it so that you can

1600
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,500
actually do your job if you're not able

1601
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,180
to do your job it's because the

1602
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,220
organization doesn't take what you do

1603
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,460
seriously and by the way that's your

1604
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,680
vote is with your feet there's nothing

1605
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,420
you do no amount of individual heroics

1606
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,760
is going to change that relationship and

1607
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,740
I've I've told many cisos that are in

1608
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,839
that situation they what do I do what do

1609
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:01,740
I do

1610
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,480
basically tell them wait six seven

1611
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,980
months start looking for another job

1612
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,660
because once you're in the ciso club the

1613
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,180
c-suite you can get moved around very

1614
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,680
easily and there's lots of companies out

1615
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,299
there that are good companies find one

1616
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,940
and stay there so all right that's it

1617
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,160
Bryson thank you so much for coming in

1618
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,559
um if you guys want to oh if you guys

1619
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:22,140
want to please do me a favor we spent a

1620
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,180
lot of time talking about uh emulation

1621
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,740
simulation

1622
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,900
um I wore this for a reason I've been

1623
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,599
with Scythe from the very beginning of

1624
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:32,640
them if you want to step this way

1625
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,920
um and I go go check them out

1626
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,359
um really they make this stuff a lot

1627
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:37,680
easier to do

1628
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,180
um and we're happy they've been here for

1629
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,400
the beginning with bhi with Wild West

1630
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,020
hackenfest so go check them out

1631
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,000
absolutely they don't just have really
