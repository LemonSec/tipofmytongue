hideous shirts they can help you with

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,120
anything but fashion sense

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,920
um so once again as far as wi-fi we're

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
keeping the wi-fi clear so we can stream

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,559
it

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,840
we're streaming this for all of our

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,039
virtual attendees we have something like

23
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,760

people streaming this from home once

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
again we wanted to keep this conference

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
so safe for people that wanted to come

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
locally and then if somebody wasn't

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,320
comfortable they could still take part

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,799

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,479
do there

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,280
because there's a lot actually going on

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,880
i also want to take a few moments and

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,959
introduce derek rook

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,080
and i want to tell you a little bit of

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,400
background um with me and derek rook in

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
our relationship i actually met derek

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
rook he was taling for me at a sans

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,080
conference

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
and

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,280
so i retired from the sands institute a

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
number of years ago and derek is one of

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,400
the main reasons why i decided to retire

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,160
from sans no it's absolutely true it's

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
absolutely true i'm so sorry

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,360
[Music]

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,680
when i was teaching for a long time it

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440
was all about building up an instructor

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,560
core

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,440
that

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,680
i could leave and there would be people

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
that would keep 504 in good hands

73
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
and i remember teaching with derek and

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
i'm like well this guy's just way

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
smarter than i am

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,560
and he just absolutely did a fantastic

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
job uh teaching 504 and that was the

78
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
first inkling that i had where i was

79
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,000
like i can move on i can kind of go off

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
into the ether and the west and just

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
kind of disappear into the woods grow a

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
beard and get weird and this kind of

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
brings up something i know some of you

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
have heard me say on webcast one of my

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
goals in life is to be forgotten

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
go off and be forgotten and i was

87
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,200
listening to an author the other day

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,519
who kind of solidified that idea for me

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
you have a lot of people that talk about

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
their legacy what is their legacy how

91
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
will they be remembered and this one

92
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,879
author

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,879
that i was listening to on a podcast

94
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
really summed it up for me he said the

95
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
best thing for an author is to be

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,720
forgotten

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
and that resonated and the reason why he

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,120
said that

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,040
is because if you write a book

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
and years from now

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,760
no one remembers that book

102
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,200
it means that book is no longer

103
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
necessary

104
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,920
i want you to think of 1984 by george

105
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,760
orwell is that book still necessary

106
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,159
brave new world is that book still

107
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,840
necessary

108
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,879
to kill a mockingbird is that book still

109
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,040
necessary

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,640
so whenever i talk about computer

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
security if somebody asked me if the

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,200
world is a secure place and all of a

113
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
sudden tomorrow you couldn't do computer

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,680
security how would you feel i would feel

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,880
great

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,759
if all of us in this room could do other

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,600
careers

118
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
and like i said

119
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,720
with derek

120
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,759
when i saw him teach 504 and teach it

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,040
brilliantly

122
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,960
i knew that that was a time when i could

123
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,199
start stepping away and begin the

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,800
process of trying to be forgotten

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,639
because there's people that are coming

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,720
up that are amazing so constantly be

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
looking for those people constantly be

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,919
looking for a platform to give those

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,840
people because ultimately hopefully all

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
of us when it comes to computer security

131
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,520
we can be forgotten in some regard at

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
some point in the future so with that

133
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
derek rook

134
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,120
thanks john

135
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
velda i want to add to my writer that

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,320
john can't introduce me anymore because

137
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
i feel like i can't ever live up to any

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,720
of his introductions

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,919
so thank you everybody thank you for

140
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,840
being here welcome to san diego i'm sure

141
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,440
your flight crew welcomed you but i

142
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,639
don't think they have the authority to

143
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,199
do so so i'm doing it now welcome i'm so

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,720
happy to be

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,840

146
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
and i'm super happy that you're here

147
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
because this is i don't know about you

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
but this is my first conference in a

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,400
couple of years

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,280
uh deadwood wild west hack and fest is

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,360
my favorite conference and when john and

152
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,800
velda told me they wanted to bring it to

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,400
san diego i got super super excited

154
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,680
and then something happened i forget

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,440
what it was but a couple years later

156
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
we're all here and this is super great

157
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
so

158
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,160
uh

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,759
we'll get into my talk in a second but

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,160
the the theme of this

161
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,840
conference is you hacked my battleship

162
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,320
so i want to play a game just real quick

163
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,240
with everybody and the people at home

164
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
can play this too

165
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,759
if you're in person it's a little harder

166
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,919
so what we're going to say is if the

167
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,800
term is a nautical term raise one hand

168
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,440
if it's a cyber term raise two and in

169
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
the chat you can just put in which you

170
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,479
think it is ready everybody

171
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,120
if it's both raised three hands

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
okay so initially i wanted to make this

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
talk like entirely nautical themed and i

174
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,600
realized despite growing up in san diego

175
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,240
i don't know anything about boats so the

176
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
terms i came up with ports and the other

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
one i came up with scallywags so if i

178
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,759
work that into the talk later that can

179
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
be our little inside joke and that's the

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,039
other like nautical themed stuff but uh

181
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,600
that concludes all of the sea talk for

182
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
the rest of the talk so

183
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
moving on

184
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,520
mostly usual

185
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,039
disclaimer so

186
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,720
the whole like my thoughts and opinions

187
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,960
don't reflect those of my employer sure

188
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,080
this talks a little bit different

189
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,440
because i actually wrote this talk

190
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,000
between two employers so at the time of

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
writing this i didn't have an employer

192
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
to reflect

193
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,280
so if you hear anything that's like oh i

194
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,479
think that's this employer i think

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,400
that's that employer it's not

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
i'm also going to be jumbling events and

197
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
timelines a little bit uh so that you

198
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
know sometimes you'll hear oh in 2017 we

199
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,039
did this may not have actually happened

200
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
in 2017 please don't call my linkedin

201
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,560
and like pinpoint like oh that's this

202
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,039
company that's that company okay

203
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,639
great can i get everybody's agreement on

204
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,720
that yeah great cool

205
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,919
excellent

206
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,680
next question less funny hopefully

207
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,840
what is offensive security's job at a

208
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
company what does offensive security do

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
and i'm just going to take a second i

210
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,720
want everybody to kind of reflect on

211
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
this what is the point of offensive

212
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,318
security at a company

213
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,759
i think

214
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,400
what a lot of people and hopefully more

215
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,919
non-offensive security people than

216
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,440
offensive security people but i think a

217
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
lot of people are going to say oh well

218
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,960
it's to hack things

219
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
it's to find vulnerabilities

220
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,160
it's to find weak points in a company's

221
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,240
business processes or

222
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
information systems it's to identify uh

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,520
gaps in process

224
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,199
not really that's that's stuff we do but

225
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,599
that's not what our job is

226
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,159
our job

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,319
and retain profitable customers

228
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,000
that's everyone's job now if you work at

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,240
a non-profit awesome great i'm super

230
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,199
proud of you you have a slightly

231
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,400
different job but if you work for a

232
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
for-profit company this is what our job

233
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,280
is

234
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,960
how we do that

235
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
depends on what your job

236
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,479
title is what your job description is we

237
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,759
all do it a little bit differently we

238
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,840
all have different uh you know secondary

239
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,159
objectives but our job is really to make

240
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
our company better and make it more

241
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,958
attractive to people to make it more

242
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,479
attractive to customers making it more

243
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,360
profitable et cetera so

244
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,000
whenever we talk whenever i talk about

245
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
offensive security whenever i'm

246
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,760
discussing things with with executives

247
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,600
it's important to realize that you need

248
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,360
to put

249
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
what you're trying to accomplish in

250
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,480
terms that the people who are signing

251
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
your checks will understand and

252
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
appreciate

253
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,279
and that has a lot to do with building

254
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,120
partnerships and

255
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
getting stakeholders on board to let you

256
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
hack things to let you bring off the new

257
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
cool hack to to buy the new technology

258
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
that you really wanna to buy and things

259
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
like that so i'm gonna i'm gonna

260
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,320
reference this point a few times

261
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
throughout the talk but it's really

262
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,160
really important to remember to

263
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,279
understand

264
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
that our job is to make the company

265
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,240
make money easier

266
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,240
so

267
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
let's let's move on to actually the body

268
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,839
of the talk now that we've got some some

269
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,480
context and some pretext set up

270
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,240
so in uh 2015 i was working as a as a

271
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
security engineer doing security

272
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
operations uh doing a little bit of

273
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,279
excuse me while i do a little

274
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,519
inappropriate uh removal of clothing

275
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,519
here it's warm up here

276
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,680
i was doing a little bit of tool

277
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
development a little bit of security

278
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
automation things like that

279
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,200
but what i really really wanted to do is

280
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,120
i wanted to be a professional hacker i

281
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
didn't have any experience

282
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,399
i didn't really have a background i came

283
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
out of systems administration this was

284
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
my first security job even

285
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,760
but i really really really wanted to

286
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,720
hack stuff i started doing um

287
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,480
i forget what hack the box was was it

288
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,399
2016. i started doing hack the box there

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,839
were a couple other like online sites

290
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,040
that you could do some cool hacking

291
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,440
stuff on but none of it professionally

292
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,760
and i wanted to figure out a way

293
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,240
to allow get my company to allow me to

294
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
do it more professionally

295
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,839
i actually pitched the idea of having an

296
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,920
offensive security team said hey

297
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,399
wouldn't you guys like to have on staff

298
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
full-time hackers and they said

299
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,160
no no we wouldn't that doesn't sound

300
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,640
good at all

301
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,800
we'd like you to do your job please i

302
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,240
was like well

303
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,600
um okay i guess i guess that's fair so i

304
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,920
started thinking about what my job was

305
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
right what my job actually was and we

306
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
you know i have this super trick

307
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
question in the beginning that our job

308
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,079
is to help you know keep the company

309
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,560
profitable but how we accomplish that

310
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
job is different depending on what our

311
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,959
our tasks are and in security the way

312
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,040
that we help make our company more

313
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
profitable is that we make our company

314
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,720
safer for our customers

315
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
we make our company safer for the

316
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,760
employees

317
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,480
we help refine business processes so

318
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,040
they're less risky we help protect uh

319
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
critical information assets things like

320
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,360
that and i was thinking how can we

321
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
really move the needle there and how can

322
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
i incorporate offensive security into

323
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,959
that process

324
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,360
well this company had uh

325
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
some

326
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,079
security awareness

327
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,760
processes as i'm sure most of your

328
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,959
companies do

329
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,320
the difference about this company is

330
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,360
that we didn't have anything

331
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,760
pre-recorded we actually held quarterly

332
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
security awareness seminars the security

333
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
team would put on and we'd you know take

334
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,120
current events and help educate our

335
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,399
users about the current events and i

336
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,120
said

337
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
one of the biggest problems we have is

338
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
that our

339
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
password practices are awful and i'm

340
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
sure no one else's company's password

341
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,639
practices are awful but ours were and i

342
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,920
was thinking how could we address that

343
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,199
and i started thinking to myself

344
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,399
why

345
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,240
do people make such terrible passwords

346
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
well one passwords are awful the whole

347
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,800
concept is terrible but really is that

348
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,560
they don't understand the inherent risks

349
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,639
behind things all they hear us all day

350
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,519
say make complex passwords and if you

351
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,720
don't

352
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
you'll get eaten by goblins or something

353
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
like we don't actually give them any

354
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,639
reasons we don't give them any

355
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,639
background we don't explain

356
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,040
what bad passwords even mean

357
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
so i decided for this security awareness

358
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
topic i was going to actually do a live

359
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,680
password cracking session

360
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
for the company and say hey

361
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,200
this is how it works i uh you know took

362
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
a series of passwords from a computer i

363
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,279
said this is how hackers generally you

364
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,079
know grab password hashes or uh you know

365
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,480
different representations of passwords

366
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
this is one of the common tools that we

367
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
use

368
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,040
we can do brute forcing and it's like

369
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,880
this and it's actually pretty slow we

370
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
can do uh dictionary attacks and this is

371
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,560
much faster and this is kind of where

372
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,760
you get dictionaries and these are kind

373
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,279
of the things that are on them and i

374
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,839
said but what what really the jam is is

375
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
mutation rules and so what we do is we

376
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,079
take dictionaries and we add in silly

377
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,440
little things like

378
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,760
adding the year at the end of a word or

379
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
adding an exclamation point at the

380
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,560
beginning of word or all these things

381
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,040
that we think of to make it easier to

382
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,519
remember our passwords

383
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,200
and i ran that demo for people and of

384
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
course like summer 2019 2015 whatever

385
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
year it was pops up on the screen and

386
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
like half the audience gasps because

387
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
they suddenly see their password on the

388
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
screen and they're recognizing how

389
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,839
this whole process actually works and

390
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,120
why passwords are in danger in the first

391
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,200
place and we talked a little bit about

392
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,839
how you can address that kind of a

393
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,519
problem by not trying to make it more

394
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,320
complicated but just making it longer

395
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,199
by not using the most popular line from

396
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,720
the most popular song that year because

397
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,000
that's probably going to show up on a

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,160
dictionary but maybe describe something

399
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,079
in your own words that you can easily

400
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,920
remember and if you just modify a little

401
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,600
bit it's a lot harder

402
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,920
to crack a long password that is in your

403
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,519
own words than something that already

404
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,519
exists and i had really good

405
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,680
conversations with people about that we

406
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
actually moved the needle in that

407
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,040
company a little bit

408
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,560
later on at the same company i was

409
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
trying to think of ways to to improve it

410
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
again and i think one of the other

411
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,480
problems that i ran into at this company

412
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
and just in general was that people

413
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,720
don't look at security the way that

414
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,120
security people look at security

415
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
when you talk to

416
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
your parents your family your friends

417
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,320
your colleagues

418
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,519
different

419
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,720
industries

420
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,639
and you point at a locked door

421
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,680
you say

422
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,199
how do you get through this locked door

423
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,320
and they're like well it's locked door

424
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,680
when they see a locked door they see a

425
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
wall essentially they see a barrier

426
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,440
that's it it's locked they can't get

427
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,320
through

428
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,480
they view locked passenger computers the

429
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,240
same way if they look at a computer and

430
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
it's off or they look at a computer and

431
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,839
it's got a login screen it's not a

432
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,760
computer anymore not until somebody logs

433
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
in

434
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,959
so what i decided was i was going to

435
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,240
hold a lockpick village for a bunch of

436
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,320
non-security people and i bought you

437
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,959
know 30 clear locks i bought the worst

438
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,639
lock picks that you can find on amazon

439
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,320
because i didn't have a budget

440
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
and i taught a bunch of game developers

441
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,480
and project managers and lawyers how to

442
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
pick locks

443
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,920
and every single person when that first

444
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,680
lock clicked

445
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,160
their whole expression changed and it

446
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,279
was like

447
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,760
suddenly locked doors were no longer

448
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,680
walls they were levels of effort which

449
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,079
is how security people look at barriers

450
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,079
is well it taken me about this long to

451
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,320
get through or oh we'd have to do x y

452
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,600
and z to get through the security

453
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
boundary uh and they started evaluating

454
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,759
it that way in fact my crowning

455
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,800
achievement i feel in that company was

456
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,639
when the office manager came to me a few

457
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,959
weeks after this and said she told me

458
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,440
she said i just got a purchase request

459
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,120
for a lock cabinet to hold some hardware

460
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,240
prototypes in and i denied it

461
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,320
because even i could pick that lock and

462
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,839
we found a different locked cabinet to

463
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,079
put our hardware prototypes in and we

464
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,680
high-fived and did a little jig it was

465
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,000
super fun but but that's how we move

466
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,759
needles at companies right as we figure

467
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,320
out what the actual barriers are

468
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,839
and we figure out how to attack those

469
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,839
barriers we as

470
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,240
i say we i think we as security

471
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,920
professionals but especially offensive

472
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,199
security-minded people or

473
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,040
adversarially-minded people our job

474
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,120
isn't necessarily hacking it's to

475
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
reevaluate assumptions that we've always

476
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,440
made it's to look at problems

477
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
differently or

478
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,959
imagine what if

479
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,560
you know what if that square wasn't

480
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,920
actually a square it was a circle well

481
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,079
that's stupid it is a square yeah but

482
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,360
come with me on this journey and let's

483
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,639
decide it's a circle and see how this

484
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
changes the scenario we can do that with

485
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,720
things like security awareness with uh

486
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
having or not having offensive security

487
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,759
at companies

488
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,279
so the next thing i did this is the same

489
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,560
company

490
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
the next thing i did is said okay well

491
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,639
this is great i get to do some offensive

492
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,320
stuff at this company but i still don't

493
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,600
have an offensive security team i still

494
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,959
haven't made the transition i haven't

495
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,399
made the leap

496
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,399
how do i do this

497
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,800
well this was kind of startup-ish kind

498
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,480
of a company they were post-buying so

499
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,560
they had you know money and whatnot but

500
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
they were still very startup small video

501
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
game industry company

502
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,720
and they had clubs

503
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,559
at work kind of like high school you

504
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,319
know they had like almost after school

505
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,959
clubs and i decided to make a red team

506
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,400
club

507
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,599
and

508
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,160
i specifically didn't really want

509
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,720
security people in the club i wanted

510
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,799
project managers and release engineers

511
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,280
and qa engineers and lawyers and and

512
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,559
things like that

513
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,079
in fact i made a rule that only one

514
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,679
security person could be in the club at

515
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,960
a time and we kind of rotated through

516
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
every few months

517
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,799
but i got a lot of interest specifically

518
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,080
because i taught them how to pick locks

519
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,120
and they're like wait do we get to do

520
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,240
more of that and i was like yeah

521
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,160
absolutely let's do that

522
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
so we started meeting every other week

523
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,919
every couple of weeks at lunch for an

524
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,360
hour and we just talk about different

525
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,080
things i'd bring in rfid cloners and i'd

526
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,000
bring in uh

527
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,880
you know better locks for them to try i

528
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,400
actually got a little bit of a budget a

529
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
few hundred dollars and i ordered the

530
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,840
same locks that were on the doors of the

531
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,120
office

532
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,919
and set up a little lockpick village

533
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,480
and we actually organized an engagement

534
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,919
like a full-on engagement we wrote a

535
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,120
statement of work

536
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,559
we pitched it to the director of

537
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,240
security at the time

538
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,919
what we wanted to do was we wanted to

539
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,840
evaluate the physical security of this

540
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,080
company we made hardware prototypes we

541
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,679
wanted to evaluate the physical security

542
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,160
of the office and do a rough assessment

543
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
of kind of how the physical security of

544
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
the company was

545
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
we didn't own the building we worked in

546
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,320
so we couldn't actually pick those locks

547
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,919
first rule is don't pick locks that you

548
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,200
don't own second rule is don't pick

549
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,960
locks that you depend on so we didn't

550
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
actually pick the doors but since i

551
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,480
bought those exact same locks we set up

552
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
a series of locks inside of our office

553
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,840
and said you need to pick each one of

554
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
these we can actually get into the

555
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,480
office

556
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
i taught them a little bit about how

557
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
motion sensors at the entrance of big

558
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,840
office buildings work and we actually

559
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,440
built a jig to

560
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,760
slide a manila envelope through the

561
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,600
cracks of the doors and

562
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,520
waggle it around at the end of the stick

563
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,200
and got in through the front door and

564
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,320
and these office managers these lawyers

565
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,600
are the ones that actually came up with

566
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,840
these ideas like oh how do we get a

567
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
stick that extends that far and how do

568
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,160
we you know how can we

569
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,600
reliably move it well enough and

570
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,799
somebody's like well what if we just put

571
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,320
a balloon on the end of it

572
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,679
i was like yeah that sounds great let's

573
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,360
do that and you start getting these

574
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,320
people

575
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,480
thinking about how to bypass security

576
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,720
how to get around different barriers of

577
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,840
entry and and get them

578
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,160
engaged so we carry out this engagement

579
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,039
we get into the office i didn't pick any

580
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,280
of the locks i made them all do it

581
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
but we got into the office one of them

582
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,640
really took to lock picking actually

583
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,120
they texted me like a few months after i

584
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,320
left the company and they had just

585
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,960
ordered like hundreds of locks from ebay

586
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,400
but so they got us into the office and

587
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,240
we started walking around and we found

588
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,840
numerous computers that weren't locked

589
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,120
this was after hours this is on a

590
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,160
weekend

591
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,600
numerous computers weren't locked we

592
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
found a brand new hardware prototype

593
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,559
that wasn't even like announced to our

594
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,559
parent company yet not in the locked

595
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,320
cabinet

596
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,200
we found that

597
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,840
we reviewed the security tapes later to

598
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,159
see what could and could not be seen

599
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,440
and we found that there were several

600
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,360
blind spots that would have allowed us

601
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,919
to get in and out of the office with one

602
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
of the hardware prototypes without being

603
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,000
seen on the on the cameras and since we

604
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,320
picked locks and didn't use our badges

605
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,720
or any clone badges there was no record

606
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,520
of who came in or who didn't come in it

607
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
was just oh well that door was open for

608
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,400
a little bit of time and now we're

609
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,720
missing a hardware prototype

610
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,440
so we wrote up a report a legit report

611
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,240
with a executive summary and a series of

612
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
findings and remediation recommendations

613
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,720
we described how we wanted to

614
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,360
reset our different camera positions to

615
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
provide better coverage

616
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,520
and we actually got a project to change

617
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
up how the cameras were and redistribute

618
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,480
them and get

619
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,799
visibility set up better in the office

620
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,639
and that was all non-security people

621
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,280
entirely i had very little to do with it

622
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
other than encouraging them and giving

623
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,280
them ideas on how to on how to plan this

624
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,760
and we got once again

625
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,159
excellent security movement

626
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,039
with

627
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,640
really not an offensive security team at

628
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,960
all and that really started my uh

629
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,440
journey down the whole you know

630
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
just applying adversarial techniques to

631
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,360
non-adversarial situations and see what

632
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,320
worked and what didn't

633
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
so having zero and i mean zero

634
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,200
professional offensive security

635
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,280
knowledge uh i had one

636
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,039
with a team i was on a team we won a

637
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,679
couple of ctfs i started a youtube

638
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,159
channel that had like three's of viewers

639
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,200
and uh somehow somebody hired me to

640
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
start an offensive security team he said

641
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,880
hey do you want to come to this company

642
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
and actually start from scratch an

643
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,280
offensive security team and i was like

644
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,799
i mean that sounds great but do you want

645
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,559
me to come and do that like have you

646
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,240
thought this through

647
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,440
um

648
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
and i accepted this position what i

649
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
didn't realize at the time or i didn't

650
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,640
fully internalize at the time was that

651
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
they were starting an entirely new

652
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,600
security team

653
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,679
so there was a security team already at

654
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,120
the company but they were primarily

655
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,880
focused on different areas of the

656
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,240
organization primarily

657
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,480
compliance related things and there

658
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,919
wasn't a whole lot of technical security

659
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:10,960
at the company

660
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
so technical hire number one for the

661
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,720
security group at this company was

662
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,760
offensive security lead

663
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
cool what do we do

664
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,840
how do we as an offensive security group

665
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,000
start moving needles start a security

666
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
organization

667
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,880
bootstrap other security functions and

668
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,960
not lose our souls our

669
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
our identities as offensive security

670
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,600
because i'm going to touch on that in a

671
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
minute too

672
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,640
well

673
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,320
the common landscape and i'm sure a lot

674
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,919
of you have experienced this in the past

675
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,000
is kind of pen tested security

676
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,880
so

677
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,559
since it was just me i couldn't actually

678
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,679
start implementing anything i was

679
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,960
writing a lot of documentation at the

680
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,320
time we started hiring external

681
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,960
consultants coming to do pen tests

682
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
and just kind of continue that whole

683
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,559
idea of pentes security so bring in

684
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,240
somebody for two weeks they tell you how

685
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
your entire security organization is

686
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,200
being ran and everything that's wrong

687
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,480
with your company and everything's

688
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,000
groovy

689
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,520
well

690
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,960
i don't know about your organizations

691
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,400
that didn't work very well for us but we

692
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,280
kind of did what we could at the time

693
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,600
the while that was happening as kind of

694
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,919
a stop the bleeding sort of a thing

695
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,480
start generating the concept of security

696
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,960
get product teams and development teams

697
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,039
used to the idea of receiving security

698
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,360
defects and working with security people

699
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,440
to to fix bugs in their their uh uh code

700
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,799
and whatnot

701
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,080
that was that was the initial stage of

702
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,799
relationship building while i started

703
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,640
writing just a metric ton of

704
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
documentation

705
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,240
and i think a lot of people skip this or

706
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,400
don't place as heavy an emphasis on this

707
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,520
as i think personally they should

708
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,559
i have been saved more times than i can

709
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,440
remember because we had already had a

710
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,120
documented mission or an objective or

711
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,960
you know our rules of engagement what we

712
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,679
will and will not do

713
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,159
stating hey we're going to you know

714
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,120
compromise this the the information uh

715
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,200
security of these systems but we're not

716
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,960
going to socially engineer anybody or

717
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,080
we're not going to do this or we are

718
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
going to do that having that documented

719
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
ahead of time does two things one is

720
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,159
when you're in the thick of it

721
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,080
you can refer back to it on whether

722
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,159
you're on course or not it's like hey

723
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,600
are we supposed to be doing this i don't

724
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
remember oh we have it documented this

725
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,919
is great the other thing it does is it

726
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,880
uh it

727
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,520
quashes a little bit not all of it but a

728
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,840
little bit of the fears of your partners

729
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,000
because if you're starting

730
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,480
something offensive in an organization

731
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,679
actually let me take a step back has

732
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,520
anybody started an offensive security

733
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,000
organization or club or function or

734
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,919
anything inside their company

735
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,880
one

736
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,840
two

737
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,520
three okay so so

738
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,000
a few of us and and probably everybody

739
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,760
on on the live stream so there's like

740
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,120
i'm gonna imagine there's a few hundred

741
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,440
of us but for those of you who haven't

742
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,679
there is an awful lot of fear

743
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,919
that these hacker kids are going to come

744
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,760
and just start kicking over sand castles

745
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,440
and ruining everything and creating a

746
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
ton of work for everyone and the more

747
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,120
documentation you have in place showing

748
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,400
that you have already thought about

749
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,159
their fears considered what it would be

750
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,159
like to be on in their shoes and how

751
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,600
you're going to compensate for those

752
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,799
issues goes a long way to establishing

753
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,640
trust and relation with your users and

754
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,279
your partners and that is paramount that

755
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,559
trust and i'm going to get back to that

756
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,840
point in a minute too because i have a

757
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,279
whole other rant that i want to get to

758
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,120
if we have time

759
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
so

760
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,480
so a lot of documentation program

761
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,760
definition first this was our stated

762
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,600
like team goal like what we're doing why

763
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,799
we're doing it

764
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,880
what we're trying to accomplish

765
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,840
our values what things guide us as a

766
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,760
team what we think is important why we

767
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
think it's important what our general

768
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
scope is and what our general rules of

769
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,799
engagement are because as offensive

770
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,200
security group we

771
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,120
by our very job definition are going to

772
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,840
break the acceptable use policy and our

773
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,279
information security policy and a few

774
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,120
other things right and you don't want to

775
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
get caught doing those things without

776
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
previous approval

777
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,960
because you could get fired or sued or

778
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,080
lots of other things right because

779
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,400
that's why those policies exist is to

780
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
prevent people from doing it so you have

781
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,760
to document these things ahead of time

782
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,559
and get approval so that legalnose and

783
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,480
it knows and i t security know that

784
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,159
you're going to be going a little bit

785
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,039
counter to the grain

786
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,279
it was around

787
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,760
it was about six months down the road we

788
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,840
started hiring getting onboarded the

789
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,039
other

790
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,880
security leaders

791
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,760
we we pulled in appsec next application

792
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,840
security next and then we had a platform

793
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
security team that's kind of our cloud

794
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
security team

795
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,679
and

796
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,559
they

797
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,840
being new

798
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,320
to a company take a while to onboard and

799
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,000
and everybody freaks out when i say this

800
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,360
but it takes about six months to

801
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,799
actually fully onboard to a company and

802
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,799
be productive you're like no it takes a

803
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,640
lot because it's way less time it's like

804
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
okay i want you to think about your

805
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,520
first six months at any company you ever

806
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,760
worked at and see how actually effective

807
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,600
you were versus how effective you were

808
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,960
like the next six months and it's you

809
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,799
know kind of hockey stick so these

810
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,240
leaders were getting onboarded and i

811
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,080
started working with them kind of

812
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,559
relaying what i've learned uh here's the

813
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,720
documentation i've written uh here's

814
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,559
where i think we should go next and and

815
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,159
those conversations were really

816
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,840
important because

817
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,039
being

818
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,520
adversarially minded in an organization

819
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,279
i look at things

820
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,679
less on what is the checklist say that

821
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,600
we need to do next which is very

822
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,480
important

823
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,399
but my focus is really on

824
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,720
well what's what am i going to try and

825
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,480
get out of the company it's not

826
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,919
necessarily how much damage you can do

827
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,120
that's not really the way most

828
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,679
adversaries think these days uh i think

829
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,880
that's a kind of a trope that we have

830
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,480
from the 90s where like all viruses

831
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
delete all hard drives and that's it

832
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,679
usually it's

833
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,000
gain information about something you

834
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,640
know gain financial uh leverage over a

835
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,679
company gain financial and gain just in

836
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,120
general through ransomware or whatever

837
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
right so we think about things a little

838
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,840
more objective focused than checklist

839
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,039
and standards focused and so

840
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,600
it's important to to work with these

841
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,760
teams to get their checklists hit but

842
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,880
it's also important to work with them

843
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
saying hey i think entry five six and

844
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,320
ten on your checklist are the ones we

845
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
should do first

846
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,440
because

847
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,520
second question who feels they're fully

848
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,440
resourced to do the job they need to do

849
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,000
with their company

850
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,480
wow can i are you guys hiring

851
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,279
oh okay well yeah you work for john fine

852
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,360
show off

853
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,559
um

854
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,640
the rest of us mere mortals never get

855
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
the resources that we need to actually

856
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,480
do a job right so it's important really

857
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
important to prioritize and what i've

858
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,679
found

859
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,880
trying to spin up these offensive

860
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,960
security organizations is that

861
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,960
working with offset is almost never a

862
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,200
priority it's almost never first on a

863
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,480
checklist in fact i've yet to see a

864
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,919
checklist that actually includes like

865
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,840
hey spin up a red team

866
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,640
but

867
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,720
we can provide that insight we can say

868
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,600
hey

869
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
these are the these are the big problems

870
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,480
that we're seeing in pentest reports in

871
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,120
workflow diagrams in

872
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,200
threat models things like that these are

873
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,520
the things that really kind of jump out

874
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,039
at me when i'm evaluating where the

875
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,120
actual gaps are and this is how we can

876
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,039
prioritize

877
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,000
another thing that we ran into early

878
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,760
uh early on was we found some gaps some

879
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,440
some issues in

880
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,480
a a couple pieces of infrastructure

881
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,200
and i had

882
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,960
myself and uh and another team member

883
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
and we had a couple other teams but

884
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,559
really we were the established team we

885
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,320
had you know the actual bandwidth to get

886
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,600
anything done

887
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
and the way we decided to approach this

888
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,480
problem this these issues was not

889
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,039
necessarily as a architecture review or

890
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,960
anything like that but we said we have

891
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
offset resources

892
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,600
so we're going to do offset things

893
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
so we did an exploratory pen test we

894
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,120
said hey we've got some we've got some

895
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
issues we want to know how bad they are

896
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,720
so we're going to attack them and see

897
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,080
how bad they are from an adversarial

898
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,159
perspective were there more things wrong

899
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,399
than what we found yeah absolutely there

900
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,279
were

901
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,880
but would we argue that the things we

902
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,799
found and exploited and got into and the

903
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,480
data that we were able to access was

904
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,640
probably the most critical of it

905
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,480
80 90 i mean i don't think i'm perfect

906
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,720
but i think we did a pretty good job so

907
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,480
this is the first example and we'll talk

908
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,399
about more of this in a second but this

909
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,640
is the first example of attacking

910
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,559
problems a little bit differently and

911
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,720
thinking well with the resources that i

912
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,080
have available to me which is only

913
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,760
offensive security because we're the

914
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,360
first team at the company

915
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
what can we get done while again keeping

916
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,200
our identity as an offensive security

917
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,360
team and we wrote up a report

918
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,919
it was not the report i'm most proud of

919
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,760
but that's okay as you're starting

920
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,919
organizations it's okay to start lean

921
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,240
and grow right find out what is

922
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,080
important to the company what's

923
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,679
important to the team

924
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,600
what kind of information what kind of

925
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,960
report styles what kind of formats

926
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,559
we iterated through i have some of my

927
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,159
team in the audience today and we

928
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,200
iterated through dozens of formats and

929
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,039
different supplements and deliverables

930
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,640
and things like that before we actually

931
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,399
found that worked for the organization

932
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,200
when you're in on an inside team

933
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,799
standardization almost isn't as

934
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,399
important as just getting it to the

935
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,840
teams that need the information in the

936
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,919
way that it works for them right and so

937
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,200
i know there's a lot of consultants in

938
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,480
the room today and i know

939
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,960
standardization matters most uh because

940
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,399
you're just trying to fly through as

941
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,480
quickly as possible and do a good job at

942
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,159
least some companies want to do a good

943
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,279
job

944
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,360
but for us it was really about working

945
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,679
with the teams to find out how they

946
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,320
wanted that information and really like

947
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,080
level up our our reports uh in according

948
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,840
to that and and i will say that even

949
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,880
though our

950
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,440
reports started uh not great i think

951
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
that we started generating towards the

952
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,480
end of it some of the best reports that

953
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
i've seen in the industry not including

954
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,720
bhis please don't mob me after this

955
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,080
okay so so minor detour

956
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,559
i talked about this exploratory pen test

957
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,200
idea and we we had a problem that we

958
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,559
really only had offensive security

959
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,080
resources and we wanted to solve this

960
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,519
problem in a way that we knew how that

961
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,760
would make sense for us

962
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,039
i have found

963
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,720
numerous times at numerous different

964
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,640
organizations that offensive security

965
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,039
people in general are fairly versatile

966
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,480
and that doesn't mean that they are

967
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,880
experts in every field that they touch

968
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,960
but what i like to say is they become

969
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,559
rapidly

970
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,720
moderate in in fields that they need and

971
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,240
then they immediately forget it or at

972
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,080
least that's the way i operate is like i

973
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,679
need to be proficient in this for about

974
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,000
a minute and a half i will deep dive it

975
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,919
and then i will move on the problem is

976
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,440
for

977
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,880
like vastly under-resourced

978
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,440
organizations it's very very

979
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
attractive to try and steal those

980
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,440
resources to put them wherever

981
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,279
you're under resourced most oh we don't

982
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,120
need an offset team but you're pretty

983
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,320
good at cloud so i'm going to make you

984
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,679
work with the cloud organization for a

985
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,840
while or oh you have a dev background so

986
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,120
now you're going to be in product

987
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,678
engineering

988
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,519
i have a couple problems with that first

989
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,240
of all uh being somebody who wanted to

990
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,679
be an offset for so long i didn't want

991
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,840
to just abandon like once i hit my

992
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,880
career goal i didn't want to just

993
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
abandon it and do something else

994
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,559
but it actually speaks to a more

995
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,640
business operations related problem

996
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,440
which is to say that if you're

997
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,679
being compromised by an adversary

998
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,200
whether that's a friendly adversary or

999
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,159
not

1000
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,640
because of under resource

1001
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,760
because you're under resourced in

1002
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,640
certain areas that is a finding

1003
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,399
that is a business problem and that is

1004
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,000
exactly what offensive security teams

1005
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,440
are there to do is find gaps in various

1006
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,720
things it doesn't have to be a

1007
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,960
technological gap it can be a resource

1008
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,840
gap so

1009
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,200
i

1010
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,840
advocate teams to lean in

1011
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,919
i advocate teams to find creative

1012
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,760
solutions so that you can

1013
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,090
provide

1014
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,640
[Music]

1015
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,279
help to those organizations in ways that

1016
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,600
make sense with your job description and

1017
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,640
theirs

1018
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,440
but that's also a finding so so you say

1019
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,320
look

1020
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,239
uh we wouldn't normally do this but

1021
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,480
we'll lean in for a week

1022
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,199
and and help you bang this one thing out

1023
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,159
we're going to write this up as a

1024
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,440
finding and we're not going to do it

1025
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,040
again this needs to get fixed this goes

1026
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,719
into your backlog and if you're under

1027
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,199
resourced you need to get resources or

1028
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,879
you need to move resources around for

1029
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,639
people whose job description is to do

1030
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,839
this thing because

1031
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,839
you're not utilizing the people that you

1032
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,159
hired and the way you hired them to to

1033
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,918
be utilized and that's important that's

1034
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,480
just as important as us you know having

1035
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,000
fun hacking stuff

1036
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,480
so it's not just a personal

1037
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,960
like feeling it's really like a business

1038
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,918
problem that we need to help with

1039
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,399
so uh

1040
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,119
it's around this time at the company the

1041
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,520
exploratory pen test side was kind of a

1042
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,359
turning point for us like i said we're

1043
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,400
getting other teams hired on

1044
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,119
we're getting other teams hired on and

1045
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,560
they were starting to build up and and

1046
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,880
get their processes under their feet

1047
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,839
and i decided that it was it had been

1048
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,440
too long

1049
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,599
before i started considering things like

1050
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,119
you can call them core tenants or

1051
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,280
principles or values or whatever but i

1052
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
started really thinking about

1053
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
what is important to us as an offensive

1054
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,640
security group

1055
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,280
what is important to us in how we help

1056
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,000
the company grow and progress and be

1057
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,599
attractive to customers and keep our

1058
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,359
our people safe and really what's going

1059
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,040
to allow us to do our jobs and so i

1060
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,119
wrote i wrote three

1061
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,280
kind of core tenants that we went back

1062
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,119
and forth on quite a bit

1063
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,320
but i like them and i'm reusing them and

1064
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
and i'm kind of sticking with them so i

1065
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,359
want to share them with you this isn't

1066
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,960
to to kind of come down and like give

1067
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,240
you three offensive security

1068
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,160
commandments but more just to share what

1069
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,640
really worked for me

1070
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,720
so the first one and this is the most

1071
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,079
important one which is why it's tenant

1072
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,839
number one but we are partners not

1073
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,760
adversaries

1074
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,400
we are emulating adversaries we are

1075
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,200
simulating adversaries we are not

1076
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,320
adversaries we work for the company and

1077
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,240
i'm going to say something that is

1078
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,599
probably

1079
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,040
one of the most controversial things

1080
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
that i say often uh and i say a lot of

1081
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,400
controversial things uh if you

1082
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
work on a red team if you are an

1083
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,480
offensive security professional and you

1084
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,599
are not

1085
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,400
that very second on an engagement

1086
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,359
you are part of blue team

1087
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,320
if if you're not actively playing an

1088
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,400
adversary at that exact moment your job

1089
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,839
is to help the company be more secure

1090
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,040
you are a partner okay so so i'm aware

1091
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,359
of and i actually really like uh i don't

1092
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,880
know if you're familiar with april

1093
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,480
wright's kind of color wheel where she

1094
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,800
introduced the concepts of like orange

1095
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,480
teams and yellow teams where you've got

1096
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,920
the red and the blue team as the

1097
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,839
defenders and attackers the yellow teams

1098
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,280
are the teams that build stuff and then

1099
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
interacting between red and yellow and

1100
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,040
blue and yellow kind of these other

1101
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,359
colors it's super fascinating i don't

1102
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,599
have the attention span for it like i

1103
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,440
love it i think it's great and if you

1104
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,160
haven't read her paper on it please do

1105
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
but i don't have the attention for it so

1106
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,920
i just simplify that dramatically to

1107
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,079
where you're always blue unless you're

1108
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,320
red for a minute okay so we're partners

1109
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,240
the idea behind this tenant is a couple

1110
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,000
fold right first of all we shouldn't

1111
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,400
actively be doing harm to the company we

1112
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,640
should be simulating harm being done

1113
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,720
sometimes unintentionally the system

1114
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,079
will go down or whatever but we

1115
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,000
shouldn't be like actually deploying

1116
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,359
ransomware and taking the company out

1117
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,359
for weeks at a time right so first of

1118
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,599
all don't do harm

1119
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,880
the next one is uh we don't betray the

1120
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,560
trust of our partners

1121
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,880
okay we have to work with these people

1122
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,800
we need to be working with them as if

1123
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,560
they're our colleagues and our peers not

1124
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
the people that we are competing against

1125
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,160
we work together we work for the same

1126
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,359
company

1127
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,960
uh some people have equity as part of

1128
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,119
their compensation package so you're

1129
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,720
literally shareholders in the same

1130
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,480
organization uh treat them with some

1131
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
respect you have to work with them

1132
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
frankly as an adversary

1133
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,800
you're kind of there at like by their

1134
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
grace like you're the outsider here most

1135
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,599
companies don't actually want or are

1136
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,440
very interested in having an adversarial

1137
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,599
team so being as friendly as possible

1138
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,280
with your partners kind of extends your

1139
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,000
lifespan there

1140
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,880
but but ultimately just behave ethically

1141
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,280
right and i have a side rant totally off

1142
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,240
the cuff not planned at all side rant

1143
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,560
about fishing

1144
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,599
there's a lot of discussion on whether

1145
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,040
or not fishing education and fishing

1146
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,359
tests is actually useful at companies we

1147
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,560
can debate that

1148
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
over drinks or something the fact of the

1149
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
matter is regardless what your stance on

1150
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,680
it it's it's required by a lot of

1151
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,040
compliance so we're going to do it

1152
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,599
anyways now

1153
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,880
if i catch

1154
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,359
any of you

1155
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,040
using

1156
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,680
physical violent threats

1157
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,839
uh

1158
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,480
pandemic relief issues financial issues

1159
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,960
to trick your users and brag about it

1160
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,440
i'm going to look at you very sternly

1161
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,200
it's about all i have authorization to

1162
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
do i can't really like do much else but

1163
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,960
i'm going to be very disappointed that's

1164
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
not the purpose of this the purpose of

1165
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,560
fishing education is to educate our

1166
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,640
users about fishing it's not to trick

1167
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,160
them it's not to uh brag about how many

1168
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,079
of them we got to fish in fact i brag

1169
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,760
about how few people we fish in our

1170
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,839
fishing education because that's

1171
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,520
actually the metric we want

1172
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,000
we want people reporting we want people

1173
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,680
talking about it we want people in slack

1174
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,200
warning each other about different fish

1175
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,640
that come in and if it happens to be our

1176
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,760
fishing test

1177
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,839
great that's the point of simulated fish

1178
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,359
we want them to behave the same way they

1179
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,880
would normally and we want our users

1180
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,280
talking about this right so this idea of

1181
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,200
like like getting super excited about

1182
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
tricking our users hacking our users it

1183
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
goes beyond phishing and into red team

1184
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,720
and pen testing as well but this idea

1185
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,800
that we're against our users has got to

1186
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,960
stop and i will continue ranting about

1187
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,880
this until it stops and i know

1188
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,400
because of the kind of crowd that john

1189
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
attracts i'm preaching to the choir

1190
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,240
mostly here but it's really really

1191
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,920
really important that we not only

1192
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,119
understand this ourselves but we

1193
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,880
advocate it to other people so we are

1194
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,079
partners not adversaries rule one

1195
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,280
rule two

1196
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,640
this is a little bit more nuanced is

1197
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,480
produce actionable results and this

1198
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,720
comes in two forms the first one is this

1199
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,079
kind of

1200
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,520
it flares up every once in a while i

1201
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,359
hope i don't cause a flare-up from this

1202
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,599
talk but the whole like controversy

1203
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,520
about releasing offensive security tools

1204
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,119
into the public and is it a good idea or

1205
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,640
a bad idea or whatever i don't want to

1206
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,079
get into that right now

1207
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:32,880
but

1208
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,040
when we generate findings when we come

1209
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,720
up with new tactics when we come up with

1210
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,440
new tools we should be part of the

1211
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,319
effort to detect them to fix them to

1212
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,800
mitigate them we came up with it we're

1213
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
best positioned initially because we

1214
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,319
spent so much time thinking about it to

1215
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,920
figure out how it should be stopped

1216
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,480
again our job is to help security at our

1217
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,079
organization and hopefully wider

1218
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,880
security not hurt it okay so when we

1219
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,160
release new

1220
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,200
tactics

1221
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,960
maybe a poc on how to detect it you

1222
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,640
don't have to write their detection for

1223
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,319
them you don't know how you don't work

1224
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,760
in their detection

1225
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,599
group day in and day out but you can say

1226
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,359
hey here are a couple identifying

1227
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,280
strings of this tactic or this is a

1228
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,040
behavior that's kind of atypical from

1229
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,880
our tactic versus normal behavior you

1230
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,319
can key in on this

1231
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,240
so that's one nuance of this the other

1232
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,280
nuance of this is um

1233
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,040
is how we

1234
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,119
plan the sophistication of our

1235
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,359
objectives of our engagements

1236
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,400
it doesn't help anyone if we know that a

1237
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
low mature maturity company is there

1238
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,640
without a security team without a sock

1239
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,200
without full-time detection and we roll

1240
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,000
in with like nation-state level tactics

1241
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,920
and tools and just stomp them and say

1242
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,359
well we stole all of your data there's

1243
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,359
nothing you can do about it that doesn't

1244
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,280
help anyone

1245
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
that doesn't improve their security all

1246
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,480
it does is just demoralize them and make

1247
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,960
them hate offensive security right

1248
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,680
so this kind of in tandem with we are

1249
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,160
partners we need to make sure that we're

1250
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,880
playing leapfrog with our defenders and

1251
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,040
saying hey you're at a maturity level

1252
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,280
whatever whatever metric you use hey

1253
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,640
you're at kind of this sophistication

1254
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,480
level we're going to use a bit above

1255
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,760
that or what we think is a bit above

1256
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,839
that maybe we're surprised maybe they

1257
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,760
hand us our all of our ttps and say

1258
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
better luck next time which is great

1259
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,200
because then we get to do new and

1260
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,560
interesting stuff we get to do new

1261
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,520
research but don't come in guns blazing

1262
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,119
kicking everybody over and then calling

1263
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,359
everybody newbs work with them to figure

1264
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,160
out

1265
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,680
what objectives

1266
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,119
you should be working with what

1267
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,960
objectives they're worried about and

1268
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,400
then maybe

1269
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,760
submit some of your own like hey i know

1270
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,800
you're really worried about this

1271
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,480
building over here but have you thought

1272
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,079
about this wall lately it's awful tall

1273
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,680
and rickety and it can you know land on

1274
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,960
your building someday so we should look

1275
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,119
at that too but really

1276
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,880
work with them and don't overblow

1277
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,240
sophistication that's another part of

1278
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,680
this actionable results make sure your

1279
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,319
work is actionable not demoralizing

1280
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,000
and then the last one and this is i

1281
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,280
don't view it very controversial but

1282
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,640
this is very controversial with i think

1283
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,240
a lot of red teams that i've worked with

1284
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,119
is default to transparency

1285
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,520
i hear about and talk to

1286
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,319
other organizations where when they read

1287
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,720
out they only read out specific findings

1288
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,119
they don't talk about their covert

1289
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,640
channel framework or what c2 they're

1290
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,560
using or what ips or domains they were

1291
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,319
using or anything like that because they

1292
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,880
want to save it for the next op

1293
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,400
your job

1294
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,319
is not to be hackers

1295
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,400
your job is to help the company

1296
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,680
so

1297
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,000
for an internal organization and i i'm

1298
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,040
not going to talk about external

1299
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,640
organizations because i know you all

1300
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,000
have businesses to run but for an

1301
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,520
internal organization

1302
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,359
give your defenders

1303
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,040
literally everything

1304
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,119
if you wrote an entirely new covert

1305
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,040
channel that just blows the doors off of

1306
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,240
everything

1307
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
don't worry about saving it for the next

1308
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,040
op

1309
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,400
give it to your defenders so they can

1310
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,560
defend against stuff like that because

1311
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
one that's what you're there to do is

1312
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,400
improve stuff two how many people have

1313
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,680
worked at a company where you only had

1314
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,480
to report a finding once

1315
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,560
and then they just fix it

1316
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,119
like you can reuse that ttp it's okay

1317
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,400
and the moment they detect it and the

1318
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,160
moment they shut it down you get to do

1319
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,560
something new because reusing the same

1320
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,319
tactic over and over again i don't know

1321
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,720
about you but it's boring i want to do

1322
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,160
new stuff

1323
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,560
so our third tenant for me is default to

1324
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,160
transparency now we don't give

1325
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,400
transparency during engagements right

1326
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,680
like the whole point of an engagement is

1327
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,960
to carry it out so it's not like we're

1328
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,160
giving them everything during the

1329
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,920
engagement but once we're out once we're

1330
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,720
reporting out give them everything

1331
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,400
everything every piece of code every

1332
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,520
domain everything

1333
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,640
okay so those are those are my tenants

1334
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,400
we developed those at this company

1335
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,160
around the time that we started kind of

1336
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,000
evolving our service catalog getting out

1337
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,160
of pentest uh centric ideas and tactics

1338
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,119
uh we started handing off a lot of the

1339
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,800
the

1340
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,319
you know pen testing is a gate to

1341
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,000
development off to the other teams the

1342
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,599
application security team and whatnot

1343
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,359
and we started thinking about

1344
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,440
what other types of services do we want

1345
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
to provide to this to this organization

1346
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,720
we started looking at uh operations

1347
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,440
and uh

1348
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,680
one thing that you'll hear a lot if you

1349
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,119
start or if you're evolving or if you're

1350
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,960
trying to implement a red team is oh

1351
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,400
we're not ready for something like that

1352
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,319
oh we're really excited about that we

1353
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,680
want to do something like that but we're

1354
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,880
not ready yet

1355
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,640
and they expect the conversation to end

1356
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,119
there but the response should always be

1357
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,599
what does ready look like

1358
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,000
when will you be ready to face

1359
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,240
an adversary when when do we flip the

1360
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,760
switch on the internet to say okay it's

1361
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,640
all right to attack us now we're set up

1362
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,319
and that

1363
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,960
that statement can come across

1364
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,800
a little bit flippant if you don't

1365
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,720
already have these tenants in place and

1366
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,920
have these relationships with your

1367
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,400
people in place because you'll also hear

1368
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,240
a lot of offset people and adversary

1369
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,480
people say oh well if you're not ready

1370
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,319
for a for a hacker then you're not you

1371
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,760
know you you need to be ready and it's

1372
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,960
just too bad we're going to do it

1373
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,440
anyways but again our purpose here is to

1374
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,520
work with people and help people so it

1375
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,920
comes out of a genuine feeling of well

1376
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,599
how can we help you get there what does

1377
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,040
ready look like and how do we get you

1378
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,880
there and one of the things that we

1379
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,359
found was that

1380
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,880
we were just kind of worried about our

1381
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,599
visibility right so

1382
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,440
rather than jumping directly into full

1383
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,839
wide scope engagements and and

1384
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,920
adversarial emulation going dark for six

1385
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,599
months and just kicking the crap out of

1386
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,800
everything we started planning out uh a

1387
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,880
few different tools the first one was

1388
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,599
kind of adversarial threat model reviews

1389
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,280
and it's almost exactly like regular

1390
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,640
threat model reviews except you have

1391
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,720
offset people do it and we did it over

1392
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,480
the course of you know four hours or so

1393
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,720
with the team that wrote them and we

1394
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,079
just walked through okay this is what

1395
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,760
you were concerned about how did you fix

1396
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,480
that

1397
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
well did you think about this

1398
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,880
what are the permissions on that file

1399
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,280
who can write to this position here and

1400
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,640
you just really think about it as an

1401
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,480
attacker and say well if i was trying to

1402
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,640
get around this thing what would i do

1403
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,319
did you think of that we actually got

1404
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,599
really good results out of that so

1405
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,040
instead of doing like two three week

1406
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,200
engagements we were doing like four hour

1407
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,760
exercises with teams and finding

1408
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,440
just as useful stuff sometimes or at

1409
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,280
least more things than just here's a

1410
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,640
list of vulnerabilities here's some

1411
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,000
misconfigurations that we're finding in

1412
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,280
your environment

1413
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,760
the other thing we did uh is is not a

1414
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,280
new thing but it's kind of what i call

1415
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,079
like discrete ttp execution so things

1416
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,800
like verodin and atomic and scythe do

1417
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,480
all this but really just

1418
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,960
packaging a tactic a

1419
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,079
procedure really and saying here here is

1420
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,920
here is an attack that you can train

1421
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,400
your detection on here is a a series of

1422
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,559
beacons that behave differently we're

1423
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,480
going to deploy it in 50 different

1424
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,000
places in your environment and we're

1425
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,480
going to tell you exactly what they are

1426
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,559
can you find them can you see them in

1427
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,319
your logs can you do you have detections

1428
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,240
for them and that allows them that gives

1429
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,160
them something to work on specifically

1430
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,079
of saying instead of saying

1431
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,680
is there an adversary in our environment

1432
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,119
we don't know we don't see one so there

1433
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,040
must not be saying there are things in

1434
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,960
your environment to go hunt

1435
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,880
to get to jumpstart kind of your threat

1436
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,960
hunting capability and seeing if you can

1437
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,880
build out these well can we even see

1438
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,319
icmp can we alert on icmp beacons can we

1439
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,559
see https beacons well we can see the

1440
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,319
beacons but we can't see their contents

1441
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,000
oh our proxies aren't working oh they're

1442
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,200
they're you know getting around our

1443
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,599
proxies etc and allows them to kind of

1444
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,200
play against an adversary for a little

1445
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,440
while without having a persistent kind

1446
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,359
of a group because i've never been in an

1447
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,359
organization that says oh we're not

1448
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,280
ready for for an engagement and then two

1449
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,040
years down the road they are

1450
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,640
it's almost always they're not ready

1451
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,839
they're not ready they're not ready we

1452
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,559
finally do one and it's like okay but

1453
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:33,920
like i know you've been working the last

1454
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,680
two years did any of it apply to like

1455
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,359
what an adversary would actually do oh

1456
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,680
no we were filling out a 153 it's like

1457
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,599
okay that's great but did you do it in a

1458
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,280
way that actually stops adversaries like

1459
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,559
this is why we want to work together

1460
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,880
early

1461
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,800
now is it about

1462
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,599
this point in the uh in in in this

1463
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,240
organization's lifespan uh we started

1464
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,440
doing adversarial emulation we we ran in

1465
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,760
a couple engagements we

1466
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,440
it went gangbusters we found a lot of

1467
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,559
great stuff

1468
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,040
we worked pretty well with the blue team

1469
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,800
and i got approached

1470
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,920
to

1471
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,880
step into a new position uh as purple

1472
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,400
team leader

1473
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,800
and that's when i submitted the abstract

1474
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,200
for this talk because what i was really

1475
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,119
excited about was to talk about kind of

1476
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,040
the ramp up from

1477
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,640
offensive security as the first security

1478
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,720
organization at the company

1479
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,559
all the way up to this fairly

1480
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,920
progressive even though it's talked

1481
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,280
about a lot there's not a lot of like

1482
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,359
deliberate purple teams especially under

1483
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,040
an offensive security leader it's

1484
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,480
usually like oh well red and blue are

1485
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,079
under the ciso so they're same team

1486
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,119
right but uh this was under a an

1487
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,119
offensive leader

1488
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,079
well

1489
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,760
six months into that reorg and there was

1490
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,520
another reorg and that company decided

1491
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
they didn't uh want to pursue purple

1492
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,200
team anymore so that's where this talk

1493
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,280
takes kind of a left turn

1494
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,079
and uh as we close this out uh what i'd

1495
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,079
like to do instead is is talk a little

1496
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,520
bit about how i'm applying the things

1497
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,440
that i just talked to you about

1498
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,599
in my new gig starting a red team at a

1499
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,880
company that's already established it's

1500
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,400
already got a blue team it's already got

1501
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
incident response they're very excited

1502
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,520
about starting a red team they

1503
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,839
approached me to start it and

1504
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,319
and and kind of how did the things that

1505
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,359
i

1506
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,920
did kind of ad hoc and off the cuff kind

1507
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,760
of by the seat of our pants how would i

1508
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,440
do it fresh

1509
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,440
and the answer is

1510
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,640
the first thing i did uh is reach out to

1511
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,480
the defensive security teams

1512
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,079
so the head of ir and the head of

1513
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,760
security operations

1514
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,319
and even i.t security i started pinging

1515
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,400
them immediately like hey guys i'm

1516
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,240
writing this stuff i want to know your

1517
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,599
feedback i want to know what you think

1518
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:38,960
about it what do you think about this

1519
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,880
program definition do you like these

1520
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,559
values what do you think about the

1521
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,680
objective and they're sitting there

1522
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,839
going like what is happening right now

1523
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,839
like we have our own teams to run why

1524
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,119
don't you just run your team and it's

1525
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,319
like that's not the way any of this

1526
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,520
works

1527
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,599
we're here to partner directly with you

1528
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,280
we may not report to the same people we

1529
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,200
may not be on the same team but we are

1530
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,720
on the same team

1531
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,000
and so

1532
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,520
first couple of weeks again

1533
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,040
documentation documentation

1534
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,319
documentation i'm starting with

1535
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,160
different documentation now starting

1536
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,000
with the values immediately because i've

1537
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,079
seen how much they help guide the team

1538
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,760
and and what we do and how we

1539
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,920
communicate with people uh was number

1540
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,880
one

1541
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,760
the

1542
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,000
idea of general or kind of like almost

1543
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,559
like an msa for rules of engagement of

1544
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,160
hey we're going to write rules of

1545
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,680
engagement per

1546
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,160
engagement as well but just in general

1547
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,760
while we're doing our own job like here

1548
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,160
are the exceptions to policies that we

1549
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,160
need out of the gate because we

1550
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,319
absolutely are going to connect to

1551
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,800
non-managed systems and we absolutely

1552
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,880
are going to try and bypass your edr and

1553
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
we absolutely are going to download

1554
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,200
questionable software like that's

1555
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,280
kind of what we do here you know but it

1556
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,720
forced me to read through all of the

1557
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,200
policies like all of them and say okay

1558
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,480
we need an exception to this we need an

1559
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,760
exception to that we need an exception

1560
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,760
to that start reaching out to people who

1561
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,119
generally never hear from red team

1562
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,680
they're like why are you guys uh

1563
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,200
calling us and it's like well i need i

1564
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,480
need your input on this i need to know

1565
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,559
how this is going to work because the

1566
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,599
more integrated we are into a company

1567
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,960
the more we're like finance or hr or any

1568
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,040
other organization that is literally

1569
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,880
everywhere an organization the easier it

1570
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,800
is to make changes the easier it is to

1571
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,720
apply leverage in areas to help make

1572
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,680
positive change in the organization

1573
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,720
okay

1574
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,520
so

1575
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,800
uh that's been my talk uh no demos which

1576
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
is kind of unusual for me but this is a

1577
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,400
very important talk to me it's it's been

1578
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,240
a quite a bit of a journey

1579
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,440
and i hope that you enjoyed it and i

1580
