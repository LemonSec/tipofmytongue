you as we go along

35
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,260
um but today's talk is really talking

36
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,600
about uh what happened with the

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,479
narrative around Russia and Ukraine and

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,479
cyber warfare and mass destruction and

39
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,700
you know we've heard about this a lot

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,380
um but I wanted to give a perspective of

41
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,900
my background you know is in the

42
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,100
military intelligence side of the house

43
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,960
I came from the United States Marine

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
Corps in the singles intelligence side

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,979
in these civil Warfare space I was an

46
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,840
intelligence analyst I you know did a

47
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,840
lot of work in cyber warfare uh in my

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,119
early career and things have changed

49
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,280
quite a bit since since then but a lot

50
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,020
of things have stayed the same and I

51
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,579
think when you hear what's happening on

52
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,560
the news as soon as there's any type of

53
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,420
aggression especially from a nation's

54
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,040
state power that has cyber warfare

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,140
capabilities you know all the experts go

56
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,600
on the news I was on the news obviously

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,700
um talking about like Hey when's the

58
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,200
next cyber War gonna happen when are we

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
going to see this you know Mass

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
sophistication of hacking that was going

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,140
on so this this talk is going to be more

62
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,179
so about breaking down the different

63
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,739
intelligence agencies that Russia has

64
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,319
its capabilities but also what we should

65
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,060
be prepared for and how we should start

66
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,220
to structure and look at things in a

67
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,239
different light so that we can get

68
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,160
better with the fence and nothing I'm

69
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,480
going to say here at the very end around

70
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,280
how do you bolster your security is

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,040
going to be uniqueer or revolutionary to

72
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,480
where we're going to completely go in a

73
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,620
different direction with cyber security

74
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,840
I think we all have a good understanding

75
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,760
around what happens it just takes time

76
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,920
to get our Security Programs to these

77
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,660
specific areas you have a lack of

78
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,860
shorter than Talent which I definitely

79
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,940
want to talk about

80
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,379
um here in a little bit but I really

81
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,120
want to get down to why we didn't see

82
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
such a massive campaign around cyber

83
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,519
warfare we saw some incursions activity

84
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,900
you know against governmental websites

85
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,000
but at large we didn't really see a

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
massive amount amount of campaigns come

87
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,840
from Russia so why is that what happened

88
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,480
why was everybody wrong uh talking about

89
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,580
that and why is it so difficult to

90
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,980
conduct cyber warfare during an actual

91
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,379
military connect extension conflict

92
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,599
um that we see obviously going on I also

93
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,800
want to say my hearts go out to all the

94
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,180
folks in Ukraine uh with everything

95
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,099
that's going on out there some some

96
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,620
amazing and brave individuals everything

97
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,180
from you know president zielinski all

98
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,379
the way down to all the troops that are

99
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,879
out there such a devastating and

100
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,159
horrible situation uh again my thoughts

101
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,480
and prayers out to to everybody out

102
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,099
there and I really hope

103
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,420
um the Ukrainian people continue to get

104
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,840
relief and support and can hopefully you

105
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,580
know come out of this in a a positive

106
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,480
light

107
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,099
um you know no war is positive in any

108
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,659
way shape or form but you know

109
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,099
definitely you know to the Ukrainian

110
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,780
people I really hope things get better

111
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,280
over there and hopefully in the short

112
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,060
term

113
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,920
my name is Dave Kennedy I've been in the

114
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,319
cyber security space for I think 25 plus

115
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,459
years

116
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,659
um I've been getting into obviously the

117
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,099
fitness thing so covet for me obviously

118
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,780
terrible situation

119
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,480
um but I got really big into uh lifting

120
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,519
and uh getting into resistance training

123
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,379
through you know a big day where I was

124
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,239
you know 315 pounds and very much

125
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,580
overweight to Little Dave where you know

126
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,620
you could barely recognize that I I even

127
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,659
existed at all all the way back to Big

128
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,099
Dave again in a different way so I've

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,979
fun uh podcast we do it every week just

142
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,360
talking about various things that are

143
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,560
going on our lives things that you can

144
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,060
do to incorporate into your own lives

145
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,979
and you know make a make a kick towards

146
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,780
the healthy side of the house and uh you

147
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,639
know obviously um we sit all day long

148
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,860
pretty sedentary uh and I'm at a

149
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,259
standing desk right now but uh we sit a

150
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,360
lot throughout the days and this is just

151
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
a way to kind of look at that and say

152
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,419
hey what can I do in my day-to-day life

153
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,580

say hi to everybody meet new folks but

169
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,580
hopefully again get to do that again uh

170
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,740
down the road here very soon

171
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,539
I also am a huge fan of Back to the

172
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,460
Future uh this is my DeLorean that I've

173
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,720
converted to The Back to the Future

174
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,120
machine uh over the years it's actually

175
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,759
in the shop right now again uh I feel

176
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,680
like every time either way west or Wild

177
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,539
West is going on it's in the shop um but

178
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,520
DeLoreans are notorious for not being

179
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,620
the most amazing and reliable cars uh

180
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,380
they have like a PR V6 in there um the

181
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,360
undercarriage is the worst part uh

182
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,100
heavily rusted out so basically when

183
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,960
they're manufacturing them before they

184
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,520
got all the coding put on the

185
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,560
undercarriage it sat outside in the rain

186
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,060
and basically rusted as they put the

187
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,440
coating on so the undercarriage is

188
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
actually getting rebuilt doing a lot of

189
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,380
work to the car to get it to where it

190
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,139
needs to be so it's a project a lot of

191
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,180
fun but I'm a huge fan in driving around

192
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,800
in the back of the future machine is

193
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,780
basically a dream come true

194
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,340
I also want to give a special shout out

195
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,720
to John strand for putting this on

196
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,940
that's obviously not John strand but uh

197
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,919
he looks very similar I think from a

198
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,720
bodybuild perspective I know John is

199
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,280
really into the fitness stuff as well so

200
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,560
congratulations on all success there and

201
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,380
it's actually a johnstrand.com and has a

202
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,699
bunch of modeling pictures of this guy

203
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,440
so uh just wanted to throw that out

204
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,699
there there was one that I actually had

205
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,960
that I was like

206
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,240
I had like a big censored Marco run I'm

207
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,919
like man I don't know if I should put

208
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,020
this in here so I kind of took it out

209
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,160
but I'm definitely going to send that

210
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,900
picture to John um you know through text

211
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,280
messages later on after this this

212
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,740
presentation uh to go through it but uh

213
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,419
again a special shout out to John for

214
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,280
putting this on and his whole team Velda

215
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,500
and you know uh Jason and everybody else

216
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,000
there you know thank you so much for for

217
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,039
what you do uh for putting these types

218
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,840
of events on and getting such an amazing

219
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,400
Community to come together share their

220
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,780
experiences

221
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,160
um and that's ultimately what you know

222
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,419
this industry is about is learning from

223
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,819
one another sharing our perspectives and

224
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,199
hopefully building upon that to make

225
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,819
things you know making the world a safer

226
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,380
place when it comes to I.T security

227
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,660
business technology uh everything else

228
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,100
that we do or essentially our day-to-day

229
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,060
lives right

230
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,860
all right with that let's kick off to

231
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,560
the actual discussion and why I wanted

232
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,800
to do this and not to uh talk about uh

233
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,720
you know living off the land or the

234
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,860
latest exploits out there I'm not saying

235
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,319
those are cool topics is I think you

236
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,060
know a lot of folks were expecting this

237
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,979
this massive campaign from Russia

238
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,139
because this was really one of the first

239
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,819
times we've seen one of the top three or

240
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,979
top four players in the cyber warfare

241
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,500
space come into a military conflict

242
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,240
where cyber warfare was was definitely

243
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,340
untamable you had Ukraine which you know

244
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,440
has both defensive capabilities from an

245
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,639
intelligence perspective a lot of

246
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,560
sharing with you know Western allies

247
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,880
from an intelligence gathering

248
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,979
perspective they've also been hacked

249
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,180
numerous times you know he had the

250
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,120
2015-2016 outages you had not pet you

251
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,440
had all these cyber attacks that have

252
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,840
happened over the span of several years

253
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,940
um that have caused Ukraine to heighten

254
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,880
their defenses uh which you know we

255
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
fully expected Russia to go on the

256
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
offense against that to try to shut down

257
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
a lot of their Communications

258
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,060
um their ability for command and control

259
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,099
their ability to conduct Warfare

260
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,860
defensive capabilities military you know

261
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,139
um military command and control so all

262
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,400
those things are are things that we

263
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,759
expected to happen uh when this this

264
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,500
campaign kicked off

265
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,599
what we saw was very different you know

266
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,099
we saw some attacks from a cyber

267
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,020
perspective we saw some wiper malware we

268
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,060
saw some disinformation campaigns we saw

269
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,680
you know some government websites from

270
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,440
Ukraine perspective uh go down but we

271
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,839
didn't see this massive barrage of

272
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,219
attacks that we were expecting this

273
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,659
massive sophistication that you

274
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,580
traditionally think of when you think of

275
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,679
a player like Russia or a player like

276
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,839
China or the United States you know when

277
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,940
you think of of these types of campaigns

278
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,620
you think of solar winds you think of

279
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,560
you know uh uh a lot of issues with

280
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,779
exchange with with hafnium with China

281
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,820
you look at you know the shadow Brokers

282
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,839
and what happened with the equation

283
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,760
group and all this secret scroll stuff

284
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,339
and massive zero day caches and all of

285
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,779
these weaponization and toolings that

286
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,880
you'd expect these groups to have over a

287
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,380
period of time and what we saw here was

288
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,880
was vastly different

289
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,459
and I think what you know we get in our

290
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,560
heads is a lot of the Mr robots or you

291
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,660
know we look at a lot of movies and you

292
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,800
know if you're in the field and you're a

293
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,600
penetration test or you're a red teamer

294
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,580
you know this stuff gets hard right you

295
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,100
go into organizations that um have a

296
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,660
high level sophistication it takes time

297
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,519
and effort takes a lot of beating your

298
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
head against the wall and obviously from

299
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,600
a capabilities perspective Russia has a

300
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,920
lot of money they have a lot of Staffing

301
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,060
they have a lot of research development

302
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,279
they have r d facilities you know for

303
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,899
weaponization and tooling and research

304
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,100
and everything else that goes along with

305
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,440
that so they have the capabilities to do

306
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,779
you know amazing destruction when it

307
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,060
comes to cyber warfare capabilities and

308
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,320
when we get down into the different

309
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,700
groups we'll see how they're kind of

310
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,920
broken out and and how they kind of

311
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,899
operate but for me why I want to do this

312
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,080
talk was I think our expectations of

313
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,380
cyber warfare need to be level set a bit

314
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,060
because cyber warfare isn't one of those

315
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,519
things that takes a day takes two days

316
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,920
takes three days or four days usually

317
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,080
targeted efforts attacking organizations

318
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,940
attacking critical infrastructure which

319
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,800
you know critical infrastructure have

320
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,000
always been fascinating to me everybody

321
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,100
thinks of the critical infrastructure as

322
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,380
you know just me this Mass Attack on the

323
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,720
grid it's kind of like the cloud the

324
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,060
cloud is a lot of systems complex

325
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,740
systems different organizations

326
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,660
different companies different you know

327
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,120
configurations different code

328
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,860
complexities introduce time and effort

329
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,420
that are required for hackers to break

330
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,700
in and it's the same thing for the grid

331
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,760
I put in that in quotation marks 85 of

332
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,620
our critical infrastructure is private

333
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,360
sector owned meaning businesses own our

334
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,980
critical infrastructure and what's

335
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,180
important to note about that is that you

336
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,279
know taking down the grid probably isn't

337
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,140
possible or if it's everything's

338
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,779
possible but very unlikely due to the

339
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,800
different systems different

340
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,420
organizations the infrastructure could

341
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,300
we see a city outage sure could we see

342
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,760
all the cities go down no you know

343
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,560
financial institutions could we see the

344
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,300
entire financial institution trouble no

345
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,680
I know but could they get access to

346
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,720
Swift infrastructure Swift networks and

347
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
you know through you know a compromised

348
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,200
bank and then from there cause havoc and

349
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,720
Mayhem potentially so there's all these

350
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,240
these likelihoods that are out there but

351
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,160
the probability of this Mass Cyber

352
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,320
attack that we think of you know is

353
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,180
something that is kind of fictitious or

354
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,160
in the movies and that's why I want to

355
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,600
level set this and say that cyber

356
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,180
warfare is very different from what you

357
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,500
think of in the movies you know when you

358
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,579
think of cyber warfare you think of

359
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,440
coordinated attacks against you know

360
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,620
their ability to do uh drop bombs or to

361
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,500
you know use drones or to jam you know

362
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,000
signals from a Signal's intelligence

363
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
perspective you look at all the

364
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,540
different capabilities and in our in our

365
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,800
military side we have a number of

366
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,880
different groups we have signals

367
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,380
intelligence we have eelins electronic

368
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,240
intelligence looking at you know missile

369
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,500
defense systems and what they have from

370
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,000
a defensive perspective and offensive

371
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,959
perspective

372
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:46,920
um you know where are their missiles

373
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,240
located how are there what are troop

374
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,620
movements looking like we have you know

375
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,180
satcom that's looking at all everything

376
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,200
from a satellite Communications

377
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,880
perspective we have human human

378
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,560
intelligence you know people on the

379
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,480
ground or um you know behind the lines

380
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,399
all of these things make up all of our

381
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,140
capabilities that we have out there to

382
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,700
make informed decisions of how we want

383
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,680
to conduct Warfare same thing for other

384
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,120
uh you know countries that that

385
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,980
specifically operate here cyber is very

386
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,839
different though in the fact that it's

387
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,640
not like we can say okay well there's

388
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,800
you know missile silos here that we need

389
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,300
to bomb or there's command and control

390
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,620
here from a singles intelligence

391
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,300
perspective we need to bomb to knock out

392
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,920
Communications

393
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
we need to do exploratory efforts we

394
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,860
have to break into systems we have to

395
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,060
learn those systems we have to learn the

396
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,440
network infrastructure

397
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,140
very similarly to what we do from a day

398
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,839
in day out perspective from a a

399
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,820
penetration testing perspective or a red

400
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,959
team perspective if you've ever gotten a

401
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,760
penetration test report you're basically

402
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,380
looking at a targeted attack against

403
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,079
your organization you know uh trying to

404
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,180
find exposures or weaknesses and to get

405
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,980
access to sensitive information or data

406
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,480
whether that's intellectual property

407
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,620
whether that's you know your

408
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,760
infrastructure and how it operates

409
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,500
whether it's ransomware trying to come

410
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,600
in and shut you down very similar

411
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,860
objectives but the same type of

412
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,440
methodology is that any of these types

413
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,320
of of of activities from a cyber warfare

414
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,399
perspective would still need to be

415
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,560
conducted with and we'll go into some of

416
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,540
this because I think it's important to

417
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,279
understand that these these things that

418
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
we see from a when we hear the word

419
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,480
cyber warfare we think you know all of

420
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,100
these massive offenses being launched

421
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,620
and in conjunction with military troop

422
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,760
movements and everything else it's not

423
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,579
like that it's very very different

424
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,440
and so we didn't see this whole Red

425
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,420
Alert thing uh out there happen you know

426
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,519
this critical you know alert and I

427
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,260
remember um when we started doing the

428
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,320
the sanctions against Russia uh quite a

429
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,399
bit in the United States here and then

430
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,220
all the EU uh folks followed on that one

431
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,480
um you know everybody was saying

432
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,160
imminent cyber warfare attack against

433
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,720
Russia it was all in the headlines all

434
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,459
the news came out and what's interesting

435
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,320
was I actually turned down

436
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
um well I showed a phrase most of the

437
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,339
news organizations turned me down from

438
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,200
going on to the to the networks because

439
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,899
I wasn't uh paddling that same type of

440
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,120
narrative I didn't see an imminent

441
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,100
attack now you saw you know some

442
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,740
advisors come out through DHS and saying

443
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,320
hey you know Russia's exploring going

444
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
after the United States going after you

445
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,060
know specific targets and we did see uh

446
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,680
increased activity from Russia when it

447
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,760
came to

448
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,560
um you know Port scanning and looking

449
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,079
for quick wins or High

450
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,060
um you know ways to impact things very

451
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,040
fast and quick but it was nothing that

452
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,720
was like hey these are planned

453
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,160
methodical attacks where we have we have

454
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,600
you know Russia's already got a massive

455
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,620
foothold a number of our different

456
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,300
infrastructure you know components

457
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,040
around critical infrastructure Financial

458
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,420
et cetera where we had this Mass

459
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,800
imminent threat we didn't we didn't have

460
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,079
that and all the narratives on the news

461
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,339
were Russia is going to attack

462
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:30,779
everything and I you know I got calls

463
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,940
from customers big companies that are

464
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,200
like Hey we're shutting down our company

465
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,760
right now or we're doing this we're

466
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,980
putting in these drastic measures to try

467
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,540
to stop and and protect ourselves

468
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,459
against these attacks against Russia and

469
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,959
I'm thinking you know what listen

470
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,000
nothing that you're probably gonna do in

471
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,820
the next 24 hours to a week is going to

472
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,680
have that drastic of an impact from a

473
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,120
likelihood perspective if you haven't

474
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,820
been doing security for for a long time

475
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,100
um so I would focus on the basics in

476
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,839
protecting yourself and getting good

477
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,940
detection capabilities in versus hey

478
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,040
we're gonna Implement a 700 character

479
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,560
password with you know 17 multi you know

480
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,420
17 Factor authentication across our

481
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,680
infrastructure to try to protect

482
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,600
ourselves against these attacks so

483
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,220
there's a lot of knee-jerk reactions

484
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,420
that were happening based on the

485
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,160
narrative that was being pumped here and

486
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,139
again we really still haven't seen a

487
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,120
massive offensive happen now Putin's

488
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,680
come out and said hey

489
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
um you know after we we deal with this

490
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,100
Ukraine situation you know we're going

491
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,320
to retaliate in some way shape or form

492
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,000
against you know the the people that put

493
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,800
us into this position obviously being

494
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,060
the United States western allies et

495
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,040
cetera so I you know I wouldn't say that

496
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,899
we're out of the woods by any stretch

497
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,339
that's not the case and we should still

498
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,260
you know be looking for these specific

499
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,060
types of attacks but again they're going

500
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,279
to be more sustained longer term

501
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,779
um than than what we traditionally would

502
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,940
think of quick hit you know massive

503
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,800
outages things of that effect

504
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,300
and so why didn't we see any of these

505
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,680
and why were they largely ineffective

506
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,680
well one of the interesting Parts about

507
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,079
um why we didn't see the large

508
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,779
Effectiveness around Ukraine is that

509
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,220
Ukraine is used to being hacked they've

510
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,920
been hacked by the gru for years

511
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,199
um you know you look at 2015 2016 you

512
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,360
look at not petya I mean they've had

513
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,820
continuous attacks against Russia over

514
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,320
time so they've hardened their systems

515
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,300
over time which has been great

516
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,980
um they're not perfect by any stretch

517
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,600
but they've definitely tried to increase

518
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,060
their capabilities to withstand specific

519
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,740
barrages of attacks now it doesn't mean

520
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,240
they're perfect I know a lot of their

521
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,459
Communications were taken down um from

522
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,279
uh the ability to communicate operate in

523
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,380
many ways starlink was a major

524
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,940
uh savior in that case and they're using

525
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,899
that predominantly for all of their

526
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,639
military command and control

527
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,320
um so new technology being implemented

528
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,579
that Russia's having a tough time

529
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,779
shutting down

530
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,220
um so there has been some movement on

531
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,320
that but largely ineffective as a whole

532
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,639
from what we've seen

533
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,139
so let's take a look at Russia in

534
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,079
general now when you talk about Russia

535
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,459
there's a lot of different units what's

536
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,380
interesting is that Russia doesn't have

537
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,240
one specific group that's directly in

538
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,220
charge of cyber they have essentially

539
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,560
three main ones and they all kind of

540
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,180
compete with one another and they've all

541
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,240
been linked to a lot of different areas

542
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,560
um that's out there

543
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,220
um when you hear most of the I guess

544
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,720
um major attacks is typically coming

545
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,939
from the svr and Gru

546
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,099
um and and the gru is a a military

547
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,679
extension there's two primary units um

548
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,579
unit uh two six one six five and unit

549
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,380
74455 that are predominantly there are

550
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,959
cyber units there's a psyops one uh more

551
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,119
for psychological operations

552
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,799
um they were very having the

553
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,179
disinformation campaigns and things of

554
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,380
that effect

555
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,540
um but really you know the gru is kind

556
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,980
of an extension of the military set of

557
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,179
house very similar to what we would

558
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,160
consider like cyber command

559
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,720
um a little bit different because cyber

560
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,820
commands both offense and defense giu's

561
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,100
predominantly offense whereas the FSB is

562
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,080
primarily focused on domestic security

563
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,120
um svr is kind of the equivalence or NSA

564
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,179
many in many cases where you know long

565
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,520
um long-term intelligence gathering for

566
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,559
intelligence gathering uh you know try

567
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,120
to maintain footholds try to maintain a

568
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,820
long you know period of time uh svr was

569
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,860
the one that was behind the Massive

570
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,140
solarwinds Attack that we saw um Beyond

571
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,419
um you know a few years ago that was I

572
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,039
was see devastating supply chain attack

573
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,260
that had implications in Microsoft Cisco

574
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,940
VMware Intel

575
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,000
et cetera Etc that you know was it was a

576
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,740
major deal so a lot of the crazy

577
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,360
long-term attacks that we traditionally

578
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,220
see and attribute to the equation group

579
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,960
on the NSA side we see very similarly to

580
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,000
Cozy Bear the svr side

581
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,419
um on the Russian side Gru mostly you

582
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,100
know again very

583
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,039
um Good Very methodical we primarily see

584
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,660
them uh they were involved in the

585
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,880
election interference in 2016. a number

586
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,919
of other uh implications too for for

587
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,840
various areas so again

588
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,280
um they are very interesting in nature

589
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,740
to see which groups would um have a

590
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,559
impact or a role in going after Ukraine

591
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,400
or going against the United States

592
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,440
during an actual conflict as we start to

593
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,280
see this

594
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,260
now I want to dive into the gru side

595
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,220
because

596
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,320
we're talking cyber warfare

597
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,660
um cyber warfare is really the focus

598
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,299
here and and the gru would be the

599
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,760
primary extension of the group that

600
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,679
would focus on targeting you know

601
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,559
organizations so you know the gru was

602
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,220
um

603
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,080
uh involved in not petya so if you're

604
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,539
familiar with the you know massive

605
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,900
um uh attack that that caused

606
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
um you know outages and over a billion

607
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,039
dollars of damage uh FedEx a number of

608
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,419
other companies

609
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,440
um basically

610
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,640
um targeted

611
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,919
um the Ukrainian tax software and from

612
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,419
there they were able to push out an

613
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,520
update that then anybody that had the

614
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,320
tax software installed it would it would

615
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,059
basically do privilege escalation grab

616
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,440
the credentials try to spread the

617
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,260
lateral movement all automated and then

618
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,460
from there start to encrypt and then

619
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,200
cause massive outages again billion

620
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,179
dollars of damage uh specifically for

621
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,860
that attack they were involved in you

622
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,020
creating critical infrastructure attack

623
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,000
um with black energy and kill disc

624
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
um they were you know very impactful for

625
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,020
that causing outages uh from that side

626
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,039
um they were involved in the French

627
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,440
election processes so you know Gru

628
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
excuse me

629
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,760
the gru is very much involved in in

630
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,679
Warfare type capabilities quick hit

631
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,140
items the ability to go in and attack um

632
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,360
and cause destruction uh the ability to

633
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,340
launch offensive attacks um in

634
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,020
conjunction with cyber warfare whereas

635
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,360
you look at the svr and they're more you

636
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,220
know again nsa-centric in the sense that

637
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,020
they're going more after long-term

638
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,820
capabilities and intelligence gathering

639
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,780
trying to understand what other

640
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,400
organizations doing grabbing source code

641
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,140
understanding how it works

642
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,940
um so very different motives

643
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,440
we look at it from a direct server

644
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,640
Warfare perspective

645
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,620
you really wouldn't see the svr going on

646
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,660
offense in many cases

647
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,039
um unless you know they had a specific

648
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,600
objective too

649
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,860
um based off of maybe in conjunction

650
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,720
with the military side on the gru so

651
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,960
again very structured you uniquely be

652
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,100
able to handle different capabilities

653
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,720
from what we see out there

654
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,120
so that's why I want to get into cyber

655
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,280
warfare is that you know if we see cyber

656
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,860
warfare happen from a GRU perspective

657
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,539
you know again if you look at not pet

658
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,419
yeah well planned they had to you know

659
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,799
attack the

660
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,600
um Ukraine the third party Ukrainian tax

661
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,039
software company they had to get access

662
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,419
to they had to understand the update

663
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,160
process um they had to understand how to

664
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,780
push updates out there they had a right

665
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,520
malware that was destructive in nature

666
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,039
they wanted to cause issues and so you

667
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,900
know that process took a long period of

668
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,780
time to go after those specific types of

669
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,660
organizations and companies

670
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,520
um with the you know sheer intent of

671
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,780
causing damage same thing for critical

672
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,460
infrastructure targeting French

673
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,980
elections large campaigns specific

674
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,080
objectives take a lot of time and effort

675
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,419
to plan for to prepare for to execute

676
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:25,919
and then from there you know to cause

677
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,020
issues when it comes to it so that's why

678
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,580
cyber warfare is interesting so we look

679
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,780
at some Warfare

680
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,460
um this is a general statement um

681
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,080
because it you know cyber warfare

682
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,000
applies to anything that we're doing in

683
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,960
hacking

684
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,059
um hacking is hard it's not easy you

685
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,559
know it's not easy if it was easy

686
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,940
everybody would be doing it there would

687
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,799
be no market for ransomware uh

688
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:44,880
ransomware as a service because

689
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,860
everybody could code you know amazing

690
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,840
you know C2 infrastructure with

691
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,700
ransomware ransomware components for

692
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,860
payments you know it takes time it takes

693
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,559
a lot of maturing you look at uh Conti

694
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,000
for example how they've matured over the

695
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,820
years uh you look at uh dark side how

696
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,440
they've how that group has matured over

697
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,340
the years you know all of these

698
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,200
different groups you know start off and

699
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,460
then eventually build up on their

700
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,760
capabilities but hacking is hard hacking

701
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,380
takes time you know reconnaissance the

702
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,460
ability to

703
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,320
find Initial access the ability to do

704
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,299
privilege escalation the ability to you

705
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,039
know gain access to specific systems and

706
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,720
from there you'll leapfrock to other

707
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,860
systems and get access to your

708
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,840
objectives all of these things take time

709
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,179
and effort for you to actually go and do

710
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,340
and so when you look at this from a

711
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,900
cyber warfare perspective you have to

712
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,240
say okay you know if it takes time and

713
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,980
effort to do unless we have a long

714
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,380
period of time of planning which a lot

715
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,020
of the reports from the Ukrainian

716
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,220
incursion was is that this decision to

717
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,780
invade Ukraine was really done in a

718
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,039
vacuum

719
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,539
um you probably didn't have a lot of

720
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,520
time to plan and execute and it really

721
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,400
can't be rushed so you know you have all

722
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,860
those different things really making up

723
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,380
cyber warfare and then on top of that

724
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,720
you know the industry is getting better

725
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,520
um and what I mean by that is you know

726
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,200
actually there was just a right before I

727
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,780
hopped on on uh to do this this uh

728
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,799
presentation

729
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,960
someone did a tweet for me saying I

730
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,340
remember when hacking Dave would come

731
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,320
into my organization and we were at such

732
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,020
a low maturity rate that day one he

733
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,159
would basically break into everything

734
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,840
and then he'd have access to everything

735
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,880
and then the next like four days he was

736
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,740
just coding you know magic unicorn or

737
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,820
the social engineer toolkit or doing

738
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,380
whatever he wanted to because it you

739
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,460
know at that point he'd already written

740
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,620
the report and it was all over with

741
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,500
um those days of hacking are are not not

742
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,460
necessarily over there are some

743
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,780
organizations obviously that are very

744
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,760
low maturity rate but those days of

745
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,900
hacking getting access to that

746
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,760
predominantly are over and it's a lot

747
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,260
harder to break into companies and

748
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,820
organizations we don't have as many

749
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,020
exploits

750
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,700
um that are only available especially

751
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,620
with the predominance of of purchasing

752
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,720
them you don't have you know you know

753
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,520
with with edrs and everything else out

754
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,679
there from a visibility perspective you

755
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,000
know organizations are taking more time

756
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,159
and effort to lock things down moving to

757
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,020
cloud-centric devices where you have to

758
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,280
focus very heavily on their

759
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,780
infrastructure side of the house and and

760
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,419
how you know middleware tier things work

761
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,120
um a lot of complexity and Technology a

762
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,159
lot of security and Technology um means

763
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,419
that we've gotten a lot better I think

764
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,059
in many ways so the hack of one day

765
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,820
doesn't happen all that often anymore it

766
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,740
takes a lot of time and effort to get

767
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,940
into an organization especially an

768
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,500
organization that has adopted security

769
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,000
into the principles of the foundation of

770
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,039
their organization those things continue

771
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,380
to get better over time so again I think

772
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,059
when we look at this and say

773
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,640
hacking is hard you know it's not easy

774
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,200
sometimes it's easy let's be honest

775
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,460
we've had those customers where you're

776
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,080
like or organizations that you go into

777
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,520
and it's just like

778
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,500
yeah we're done

779
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,780
um I had one this is a funny sources a

780
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,220
long time ago

781
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,780
um it was a previous company I was

782
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,179
working for and I was writing a tool

783
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,320
called

784
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,960
um automator it was an internal tool

785
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,299
only and it was to automate

786
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,340
um a lot of the manual tasks that we had

787
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,140
to do especially on internal pen tests

788
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,080
like uh look for weak SQL accounts

789
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,539
um you know look for you know net bios

790
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,820
shares you know try null sessions and

791
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,220
extracting user accounts enumeration of

792
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,780
subnet masks and being able to look at

793
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,039
where their server infrastructures are

794
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,500
like just automated a lot of our manual

795
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,880
tasks that we had to do during a

796
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,220
penetration test and

797
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,260
the one of the guys at the time was like

798
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,419
listen Dave please don't hack this one

799
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,159
just let me give me an hour Head Start

800
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,720
just because I know you're going to

801
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,940
break in the first hour or two and uh

802
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,799
you know just just chill and relax and I

803
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,460
remember

804
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,960
um I was like no problem I'll just code

805
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,179
my automated tool for a bit and I had

806
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:25,740
forgotten that um

807
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,600
there was a sort of testing things out

808
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,400
and I coded this additional step where

809
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,440
it would automatically you know once it

810
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
found a specific account that it could

811
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,320
use it would check to see if it had

812
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,700
administrative of access and report back

813
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,039
and I remember running the tool

814
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,240
internally just to kind of test it out

815
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,559
to make sure it was working you know uh

816
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,419
do any bugs and the other guys started

817
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,500
in hack and I think I was in there for

818
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,960
about six minutes and they had a blank

819
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,000
essay account uh SQL administrator

820
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,520
account on a domain controller

821
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,080
um so I was able to spawn the XP command

822
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,760
shell and I had domain admin rights

823
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,080
within six minutes of me plugging in

824
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,299
which made this individual super mad so

825
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,919
um you know though again those days very

826
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,020
differently but most of the time hacking

827
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,860
is hard

828
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,120
um and most of the time hacking takes

829
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,279
time and most the time hacking can't be

830
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,500
rushed um and so you know you look at

831
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,380
what happened with with Russia

832
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,179
you know we saw this you know

833
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,240
retaliation language we started to see

834
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,120
scans happening uh to start to rush

835
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,559
things but we really haven't seen much

836
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,000
of an impact and again I'm not saying

837
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,620
that's not going to happen I'm not

838
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,580
saying that we're not going to be

839
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,720
attacked I'm not saying that we're going

840
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,159
to have some big companies that are

841
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,200
hacked I'm saying that it takes time for

842
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,880
that to happen and we can absolutely

843
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,120
prevent it with good defensive measures

844
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,559
I want to hit on ransomware because

845
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,380
it plays a huge role uh in all of this

846
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,640
um you look at what happened with conti

847
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,440
and you know just to throw out the Conte

848
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,279
thing here

849
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,200
the Conte this is from from content

850
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,200
themselves this is uh February 25th the

851
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
Katy team is officially announcing a you

852
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,740
know a full support of the Russian

853
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,659
government if anybody will decide to

854
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,340
organize a Cyber attack or any War

855
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,440
activities against Russia we are going

856
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,179
to use all of our possible resources to

857
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:01,799
strike back at critical infrastructure

858
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,960
of the enemy and recently we just saw

859
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,419
March 21st 2022

860
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,880
um that uh ransomware was hit with our

861
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,159
third largest supply chain logistics

862
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,779
company or shut down their operations to

863
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,880
where they couldn't import or export

864
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,960
um specific things and obviously our

865
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,880
supply chain is already jacked up uh in

866
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,140
general

867
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,059
um and so you you hit that to where we

868
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,320
can't even do important exports of

869
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,760
things that starts to back things out

870
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,460
even more so why I bring up ransomware

871
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,380
is that you know ransomware in these

872
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,240
countries are often used

873
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,840
um as a mechanism for chaos and issues

874
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,980
that happen there and I'm not saying

875
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,059
that they're working on behalf of the

876
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,679
government I mean there hasn't been

877
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,299
direct statements from the US government

878
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,400
saying they have this information but if

879
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,720
you look at how they're able to operate

880
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,340
with impunity and you see you know

881
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,740
discussions like this obviously there

882
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,299
are things that are happening uh to

883
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,340
where these groups can operate be very

884
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,140
profitable I mean I think Conti's up in

885
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,120
the 160 million dollar range 190 million

886
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,340
dollar range last I heard from the FBI

887
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,779
um and so that's a lot of money that

888
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:58,860
that they've gotten over the past

889
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,419
several years from obviously they've

890
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:01,500
rebranded a few times for different

891
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,659
times in different groups but um what's

892
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,100
interesting to see with the Conti leaks

893
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,880
is that

894
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,919
you know they have everything from you

895
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,600
know research and development uh they're

896
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,159
purchasing third-party applications to

897
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,140
test their software against it uh they

898
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,520
have help desks I thought it was

899
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,980
freaking hilarious that uh one of their

900
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,960
other hackers couldn't get out of VI and

901
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,279
uh was like basically saying like this

902
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,620
thing is the spawn of Satan uh which I

903
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,539
fully agree with uh Nano is definitely

904
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,279
better than VI in every way shape or

905
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,539
form and there was no discussion there

906
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,679
at all

907
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,299
um so sorry for for everybody that

908
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,340
that's still using the Legacy VI side of

909
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,840
the house and probably Pearl at the same

910
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,480
time but anyways um what happened with

911
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,980
with the Conti Elise I thought was

912
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,880
really interesting and obviously I'm

913
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,340
just joking you folks um not not about

914
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,080
Pearl like seriously like not about

915
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,720
Pearl but VI Nano you're fine

916
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,880
um but with the Conti leaks uh what I

917
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,260
thought was was really interesting is we

918
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,179
got to see a good glimpse of how these

919
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,559
how these organizations operate and

920
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,720
really how methodical they were now I

921
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,860
wouldn't say that they're extremely

922
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,880
sophisticated they're using the same

923
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,740
type of techniques that we would use

924
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,419
from a penetration testing perspective

925
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,279
but you know they are launching attacks

926
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,600
against organizations United States

927
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,240
causing havoc and I think these groups

928
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,340
are more structured from a cyber warfare

929
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,620
perspective to inflict more damage than

930
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,360
what you would typically see from like a

931
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,640
GRU perspective so I think you'll see

932
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,740
more damage happening and more elevation

933
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,600
occurring from these different groups

934
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,399
just recently Conti restructured their

935
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,559
software since it was leaked so now

936
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,940
they're back back in

937
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,620
action again going after organizations

938
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,419
but again I think one of our biggest

939
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:28,440
areas that we're going to see from an

940
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,059
elevation perspective is more ransomware

941
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,820
less on the massive cyber warfare that

942
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,100
we saw from you know or that we thought

943
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,020
was going to happen from from the gru or

944
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,179
svr

945
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,240
and so I wanted to show an actual uh

946
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,340
slide of a

947
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,919
um hacker from the svr hacking you got

948
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,000
to have the

949
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,940
um black hoodie and gloves I love these

950
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,820
pictures because like who really wears

951
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,440
gloves like is it because you don't want

952
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,120
to get your fingerprints on the keyboard

953
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,880
that is your own computer anyways I just

954
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,320
wanted to show a picture of a hacker and

955
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,440
a black hoodie so why cyber War failed

956
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,240
in Ukraine it so far and and everything

957
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,880
else I I kind of kind of hit on this but

958
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,740
you know when you look at at the time

959
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,960
and effort it takes to go after a

960
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,340
country to go after critical

961
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,440
infrastructure to go after you know

962
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,299
Financial sectors to go after supply

963
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:21,419
chain and Logistics to go after XYZ you

964
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,279
know what's interesting with Kanti is um

965
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,740
and most ransomware groups is that they

966
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,860
predominantly Target manufacturing now

967
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,940
uh there's a couple of reasons for that

968
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,620
one manufacturing traditionally has

969
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,299
horrible security now I think that's

970
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,159
changing because manufacturing is one of

971
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:36,720
the largest hit but it also has

972
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,000
implications because Manufacturing

973
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,980
if you shut down production of actually

974
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,380
making the product it has probably the

975
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,840
largest Monumental impact in your

976
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,520
company and organization versus another

977
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,679
type of company so if you can't make

978
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,559
you know a specific widget or a specific

979
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,179
piece of equipment

980
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,620
um and you start to get backward and

981
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,000
you're probably already experiencing

982
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,500
supply chain issues of actually getting

983
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,960
the material material costs are high if

984
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,760
all of these different you know things

985
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,200
that are happening we go into these

986
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,279
types of Investigations all the time

987
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,080
where I mean it's absolutely crippling

988
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,080
this company or a company inside and out

989
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,520
because

990
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,360
um they're actually shutting down

991
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,520
production so when you look at at

992
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,840
manufacturing there's some of the

993
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,399
weakest and they're some of the most

994
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:18,600
impacted

995
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,580
um based off of what we see from from

996
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,100
various different ransomware groups

997
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,240
um I thought this was also interesting

998
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,880
the the Russian spy Chief so so the main

999
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,580
uh person in charge of the gru was put

1000
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,440
under house arrest because of the

1001
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,120
intelligence failures

1002
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,440
um of everything else so again you know

1003
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,320
we we see Russia's frustration on this

1004
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,700
and they haven't had a lot of impact

1005
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,860
especially on the cyber warfare side and

1006
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,840
the intelligence uh Gathering and and

1007
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,940
offensive capability side to shut down

1008
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,200
Communications and everything else I

1009
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,179
don't think they anticipated uh starlink

1010
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,320
I don't think they anticipated a lot of

1011
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,760
the other things out there

1012
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,559
um but it'll be interesting to see

1013
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,080
so you know again I go back into some of

1014
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,340
the planning and execution side of the

1015
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,840
house Ukraine's been under attack for

1016
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,460
for a number of years

1017
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,020
um they're far from impervious to

1018
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,240
attacks but they

1019
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,460
um you know uh I mean not to say that

1020
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,600
they're perfect in any way shape or form

1021
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,220
but they have the ability to withstand

1022
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,140
some of these traditional basic attacks

1023
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,460
and again starlink was a huge game

1024
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,140
changer for them and I don't think it's

1025
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,640
something that was anticipated by Russia

1026
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,960
from a command and control perspective

1027
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,820
or operations

1028
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,340
um when you look at svr versus uh Gru

1029
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,799
you know the svr is

1030
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,720
um more longer sustained intelligence

1031
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,000
gathering Gru more weaponization or

1032
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,980
offensive capabilities I don't see the

1033
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,380
svr really pulling or launching more

1034
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,880
offensive type of attacks because they

1035
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,260
don't want to burn all their sources now

1036
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,440
that could happen and when you hear

1037
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,020
um in a lot of cases like President

1038
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,020
Biden said um you know if we see a cyber

1039
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,940
warfare attack we have a number of

1040
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,679
offensive capabilities in the Cyber

1041
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,260
realm at our disposal as well and a lot

1042
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,539
of times he's discussing

1043
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:52,200
um

1044
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,539
capabilities of the NSA where we have

1045
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,880
entrenched footholds into certain parts

1046
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,380
of Russia's infrastructure I would

1047
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,200
assume not seeing that by knowing

1048
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,140
um and those types of footholds are

1049
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,820
great intelligence sources for us to get

1050
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,039
some information out of out of um the

1051
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,260
country and so if we launch offensive

1052
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,880
capabilities against those we burn the

1053
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,960
sources we start to lose those

1054
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,059
intelligence footholds as with svr as

1055
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,039
they start to go into those so unless

1056
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,679
the svr is planning on burning

1057
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,779
they're already established intelligence

1058
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,179
sources you know I don't see there being

1059
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,760
this massive again type of you know

1060
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,380
attack against us you know that's going

1061
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,419
to cause a cataclysmic outage or

1062
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:31,980
foothold into our infrastructure

1063
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,200
anything else that's out there

1064
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,159
um so some of the things we need to

1065
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,440
think about though uh we need to prepare

1066
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,000
you know attacks are coming there's no

1067
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,200
question

1068
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,399
um the sophistication levels I think

1069
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,019
will vary you know again if we go to the

1070
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,299
long-term sustained type of approach

1071
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,860
they look more methodical down the road

1072
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,140
you know we'll see the solar winds types

1073
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,000
of attacks we'll see the not yet types

1074
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,399
of attacks um but again those take some

1075
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,140
time to actually go about and you know

1076
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,279
you start to look at what Russia's been

1077
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,140
doing with a lot of their previous ttps

1078
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,899
or tactics techniques and procedures

1079
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,120
um they've been focusing very heavily on

1080
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,679
cloud um going after that as a mean

1081
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,360
mechanism and we have generally a lack

1082
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,520
of visibility into that so you know I

1083
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,960
think that's an important piece for us

1084
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,339
is that it's not just our on-prem

1085
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:12,839
infrastructure it's also our Cloud

1086
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,280
infrastructure that's also vulnerable in

1087
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,500
many cases I do want to do a quick recap

1088
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,899
on lapses because you know this turned

1089
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,339
out to be a couple teenagers out of out

1090
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,440
of the UK but they hacked in the

1091
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,760
Microsoft Bing source code they had

1092
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,859
access to T-Mobile uh they had access to

1093
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,619
OCTA uh allegedly you know third party

1094
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:29,760
on that one

1095
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,139
um but still had access to customer

1096
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,280
accounts

1097
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,918
Samsung LG and a whole bunch more you

1098
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:37,080
know if a bunch of uh 16 17 year old

1099
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,940
kids can can impact these larger

1100
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,099
organizations what I thought was really

1101
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,139
interesting about them

1102
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,480
that I obviously didn't like to see but

1103
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,940
I I like to see how they're hacking

1104
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,020
because the the techniques they were

1105
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,159
using were pretty interesting they

1106
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,899
focused very heavily on cloud-centric

1107
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,540
applications instead of going after like

1108
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,040
traditional on-premise infrastructure

1109
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,780
Now LG is very different they dump their

1110
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,580
domain controllers and usernames and

1111
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,380
password hashes and everything else if

1112
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,820
you look at OCTA you look at you look at

1113
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,660
everything else it was all through

1114
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,980
portals and going through our middleware

1115
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,240
tiers and going through our cloud

1116
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,859
services which you know we don't

1117
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,300
traditionally see from a lot of these

1118
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,680
ransomware groups that are out there

1119
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,820
which is where we see a lot of the noise

1120
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,920
coming from so you know I think you know

1121
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,900
from from a security perspective

1122
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,400
two of the biggest things that concern

1123
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,920
me uh one being supply chain attacks so

1124
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,660
getting access through a third party

1125
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,700
that's trusted pushing out source code

1126
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,619
then from there I'm having access to

1127
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,900
multiple customers um as you saw with

1128
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,880
caseya on that ransomware side

1129
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,280
and then you know um obviously our Cloud

1130
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,079
infrastructure which typically has a lot

1131
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,000
of lack of visibility so you know I'm

1132
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,980
I'm extremely concerned about Security

1133
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,660
in those two areas right now and as

1134
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,640
these groups again develop more and more

1135
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,020
sophistication levels that shift to

1136
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,180
those different types of realms

1137
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,980
so what can we do

1138
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,599
um again none of this is going to be

1139
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,940
groundbreaking but you know Shore up

1140
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,020
your ability for monitoring detection

1141
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,460
immediately you know what's normal

1142
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,920
what's not normal look at at you know

1143
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,320
unusual behavior do you use PS exec in

1144
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,180
your environment no okay in any time PS

1145
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,680
exec has ever used it should be uh oh

1146
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,940
hell or something in our environmental

1147
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,839
arm

1148
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,579
um segmentation I can't emphasize enough

1149
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,859
the ability to reduce ports and

1150
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:08,880
protocols and the ability for

1151
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,320
authentication especially on lower level

1152
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,380
protocols like SMB and RPC invaluable uh

1153
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,119
in many cases so especially workstation

1154
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,220
workstation communication like why do we

1155
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,180
still have workstation workstation

1156
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,260
communication and networks from a

1157
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,460
lateral movement perspective shut that

1158
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,500
down uh if you have users still running

1159
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,200
as administrators I I mean

1160
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,940
start there I guess you have a lot of

1161
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,619
work to do to catch up on and uh you

1162
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,660
have a lot of attack surface to go

1163
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,980
through geez

1164
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,320
um continue to see a test uh test your

1165
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,520
defensive capabilities you're running

1166
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,140
offensive testing so you know

1167
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,460
understanding your offense by building a

1168
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,300
really good defense and understanding

1169
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,400
your defenseman running a good offense

1170
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,480
being able to do those types of

1171
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,859
simulations are already purple teaming

1172
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,540
uh things that could really help out in

1173
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,000
many cases uh get cause visibility

1174
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,980
somehow that's most important I think

1175
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,720
right now is is trying to understand hey

1176
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,099
what is our Cloud infrastructure how

1177
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:54,540
does it have access to our our

1178
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,980
environment and how can that be used to

1179
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,900
piggyback or attack specific things so

1180
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,420
again visibility visibility visibility

1181
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,740
looking for things in our environment

1182
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,060
that we can do

1183
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,740
common high yield areas where we see

1184
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,599
from a detection perspective you know

1185
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,800
Powershell is still massively used

1186
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,680
living off the land binaries and scripts

1187
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,480
macros ps6 uses is used by most

1188
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,099
ransomware groups out there

1189
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,839
um anytime at wmic usage especially

1190
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,359
Russia loves to use wmic quite a bit

1191
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,859
um lsas methods for extracting

1192
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,300
credentials whether it's through vssam

1193
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,740
and process injection

1194
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,960
Etc ways of getting credentials

1195
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,400
um lateral movement on lower level

1196
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,160
protocols like SMB and RPC you know any

1197
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,599
type of like workstation workstation

1198
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,980
Communications that you traditionally

1199
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,680
see out there I think are important and

1200
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,760
then uh use of any type of

1201
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,680
reconnaissance tools for understanding

1202
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,480
who they are who am I net commands I

1203
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,520
have to config you know running commands

1204
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,460
in general through command.exe I got all

1205
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,500
quick hit items that you know you can

1206
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,660
Baseline in your environment say hey if

1207
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,220
we see any usage of this if that's

1208
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,960
normal okay cool put an exception in for

1209
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,619
that

1210
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:53,760
and then look for deviations and

1211
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,619
patterns of behavior as things go along

1212
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,240
I think those are all key things that

1213
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,220
kind of start to make things a little

1214
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,300
bit better

1215
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,640
um but wrapping things up uh again I

1216
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,500
think that the big takeaway here is that

1217
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,359
you're not going to see this massive

1218
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:07,740
cyber war between all of these different

1219
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,720
countries where it's this cataclysmic

1220
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,760
outage of everything that's going on

1221
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,020
um I think the capabilities are there

1222
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,180
from a Warfare perspective to shut down

1223
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,760
command and control signals intelligence

1224
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,900
all these different areas and that's

1225
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,160
what countries do

1226
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,599
but you know from a cyber warfare

1227
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,920
perspective this is still a very much

1228
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,720
evolving mature area I mean cyber

1229
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,579
command is still relatively new to be a

1230
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:27,839
direct extension of both offensive

1231
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,040
defensive capabilities in our military

1232
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,079
side of the house so it's still going to

1233
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,700
kind of pan out but we still really have

1234
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,220
not seen this massive impact that cyber

1235
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,599
has had from a Warfare perspective I

1236
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,740
think for most organizations and

1237
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,200
companies your real risk is really

1238
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,060
predominantly still on ransomware uh the

1239
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,680
ransomware side of the house not from an

1240
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,599
imminent attack against Russia I'm not

1241
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,920
going to say that you know other

1242
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,000
countries and their motives and

1243
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,920
demographics um don't have an impact in

1244
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,020
your in your in your field especially

1245
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,700
around peers if it's you know medical

1246
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,099
research you know intellectual property

1247
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,660
uh things like that can always be

1248
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,400
devastating if you're doing you know

1249
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,099
work for DOD Contracting or have you

1250
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,540
know ties to that those are always you

1251
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,339
know areas of opportunity so again I'm

1252
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,480
not saying that that every industry

1253
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,740
vertical is the same but you know

1254
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,180
manufacturing predominantly going to be

1255
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,200
ransomware

1256
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,160
um you know most organizations

1257
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,780
predominantly in ransomware as your

1258
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,280
greatest threat and probability and we

1259
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,960
can do a lot of things to Shore that up

1260
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,760
to identify as it happens make it

1261
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,320
stronger and hopefully protect against

1262
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,300
it but that's it for me I really

1263
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,579
appreciate everybody at Way West hacking

1264
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,480
Fest hopefully you're having a great

1265
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,940
time there I'm so jealous of everybody

1266
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,980
that's there uh today and again thanks

1267
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,020
again for everybody there uh for putting

1268
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,520
this on and for having me and for

1269
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,380
listening to me rant about cyber warfare

1270
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,820
that's something that I think is really

1271
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,800
fascinating interesting and again my

1272
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,060
heart goes out to all the Ukrainian

1273
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,680
people uh that are experiencing Warfare

1274
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,260
right now the women children uh men uh

1275
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,520
that are all over there

1276
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,260
um you know very saddened uh with

1277
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,040
everything that's happening over there

1278
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,200
and I hope uh it ends soon and uh the

1279
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,180
people of Ukraine Prevail um in many

1280
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,520
cases so or in all cases but uh thank

1281
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,720
you all very much for your time today

1282
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,680
and have a good one
