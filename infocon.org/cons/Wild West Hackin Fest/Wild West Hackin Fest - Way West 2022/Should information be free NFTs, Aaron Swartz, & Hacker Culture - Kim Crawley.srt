1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,960
okay so this is should information be

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,059
free nfts Aaron Schwartz and agriculture

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,680
so I'm just going to very quickly

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,900
introduce myself before we get into the

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,600
meat of the presentation so I'm Kim

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,380
Crawley uh I work for synac which has

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,680
pen testing technology and my job title

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,500
there is senior contributing writer so I

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,600
mainly contribute content to their blogs

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,700
and I write white papers and I do

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,360
research projects for them I've I my

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,780
resume just goes back like forever but

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,640
some of the more notable companies I've

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,860
worked for over the years include hack

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,039
the Box Blackberry silence at T cyber

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,879
security venify sofos and it just goes

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,559
on and on and on

18
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,140
so I co-authored the pen tester

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,480
blueprint with Philip Wiley a couple of

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,780
years ago last year I published my very

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,420
first solo work eight steps to better

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,520
security a simple cyber resilience guide

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,799
for business and I was featured in the

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,680
first volume of tribe knockers

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,720
I've had lots of very interesting side

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,780
gigs one of them from about a little

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,700
over a year ago was researching

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,740
blockchain cyber attacks for valid

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,640
Network

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,700
I am Kim underscore Crowley on Twitter

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,220
and I live on Twitter so if you want to

32
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,100
speak to me interact with me that's the

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,380
best way to reach me if you're into

34
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,500
astrology like I am uh my son is in

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,140
Capricorn Taurus Moon Scorpio Rising I

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,000
don't know if that then you care about

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,500
that I live in Toronto and this may be a

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,720
spoiler for what the ideology behind

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
this presentation is but would I right

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,960
click an nft I sure would

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,899
so let's get into it here's just a quick

42
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,520
sample of some of the research that I've

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,500
done for valid Network

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,540
so basically

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,780
this little bit is about how

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,800
authentication exploits are very easy to

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,819
do within blockchain based systems

48
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,920
and I did some more research on another

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,200
service attacks to blockchain which is

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,780
very possible there is block stuffing

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,700
attacks with lots of other ways to do it

52
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,940
so if any nft bro tries to tell you that

53
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,340
blockchain is like the best possible

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,440
security

55
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,220
and it's so secure and yada yada I find

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,680
more security problems with blockchain

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,900
than the vast majority of other

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,480
cryptographic implementations nothing is

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,620
100 secure but blockchain is in my

60
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,019
opinion less secure than a lot of other

61
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,480
Technologies

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,760
so I've got technical audience here many

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,140
of you may have an idea of what

64
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,540
blockchain is but just in case let's

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,920
just make sure that we're all on the

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,940
same page

67
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,220
so if blockchain is a public Ledger it's

68
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,840
an ever-growing series of transaction

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,300
markers that can be easily visible by

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,300
anyone and that's true uh all the

71
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,879
blockchains behind all the major

72
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,560
cryptocurrencies and the blockchains

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,220
that nfts and stuff like that run on are

74
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,340
all you can view those records publicly

75
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,739
uh crypto Bros love to post about how

76
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,599
the public accessibility of blockchain

77
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,519
is a great for transparency and

78
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,340
verification

79
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,620
yeah but it gets complicated there's so

80
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,379
many so many problems so the total

81
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,819
amount of data on the ethereum

82
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,680
blockchain used by the ethereum

83
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,260
cryptocurrency and nfts because most

84
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,700
nfts use the ethereum blockchain is over

85
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,760
a terabyte now and for just like a whole

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,819
bunch of texts that's pretty impressive

87
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,180
and huge the total amount of data on the

88
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,760
Bitcoin blockchain at this point is over

89
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,360
250 gigabytes the data capacity of a

90
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,280
single block on the ethereum blockchain

91
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,819
is about one megabyte and I'll just go

92
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,099
I'll show you in the next slide what the

93
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,860
ethereum blockchain looks like

94
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,000
blockchains were designed to store blogs

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,340
of ASCII text Data this and the one

96
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,199
megabyte limit of individual blocks

97
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,760
they're an important point to keep in

98
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,858
mind during my presentation

99
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,060
so records are created on the blockchain

100
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,360
most often through proof of work and

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,979
proof of work is a mechanism that

102
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,320
requires computers to solve very complex

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,419
math problems in order to record a red

104
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,460
block on the blockchain this is the

105
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,220
crypto and cryptocurrency this math is

106
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,020
informed every time cryptocurrency is

107
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,840
bought or sold or used to buy something

108
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,699
proof of work is also report required to

109
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,740
record a book on the ethereum blockchain

110
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,520
in order to create an nft and these

111
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,220
blockchains are constantly dependable

112
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,680
they just get appended to they just get

113
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,300
longer and longer and longer as time

114
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,120
goes on and they the data on the

115
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,840
blockchains cannot be altered aside from

116
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,060
appending so if you want to remove a

117
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,220
block from a blockchain basically you

118
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,020
can't do it and it just grows and just

119
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,020
goes on and on and on and as it grows

120
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,940
the amount of computation that's

121
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,919
required to record a new block just

122
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,440
keeps growing exponentially that's why

123
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,660
around 2009 2010 you could mine Bitcoin

124
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,020
with a Raspberry Pi and now in order to

125
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,720
mine Bitcoin Bitcoin or other major

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,300
cryptocurrencies you basically need a

127
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,120
massive Computing cluster which is part

128
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,220
of the reason why gpus are so expensive

129
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,539
these days

130
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,000
so each proof of work action consumes a

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,220
large amount of electricity in order for

132
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,620
very powerful Computing clusters to do

133
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,479
the math required in order to record a

134
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,759
block as the ethereum blockchain grows

135
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,800
each proof of work for each new block

136
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,740
requires increasingly complex math and

137
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,300
therefore more computing power and

138
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,699
electricity consumption and of course

139
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,060
our capacity for electricity is not

140
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,120
infinite nor is the planet's ability to

141
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,039
withstand all the pollution of all of

142
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,479
this causes

143
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,820
so as I told you I would show you what

144
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,259
the ethereum blockchain looks like

145
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,620
here's a very short sample so it's like

146
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,400
a bunch of hashes and a bunch of IDs

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,460
related to cryptocurrency wallets and

148
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,639
whatnot and it's all just very most of

149
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,280
these blocks are not even anywhere close

150
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,500
to the one megabyte limit for a single

151
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,319
block it's just a whole bunch of text

152
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,720
as I mentioned blockchain is killing our

153
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,940
planet the ethereum blockchain currently

154
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,160
produces as much electricity as an

155
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,500
entire country roughly equivalent to

156
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,660
live your the Netherlands this will

157
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,120
continue to grow as blockchain grows a

158
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,740
single block produced by proof of work

159
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,539
consumes more electricity than a

160
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,100
household in the developed World

161
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,440
consumes in a week and that's for a

162
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,720
single block that's for like someone

163
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,300
buys in cryptocurrency someone sells um

164
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,900
an nft is put on the blockchain each of

165
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,660
these actions consumes more electricity

166
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,880
than a household does in a week

167
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,180
the ethereum 2.0 is currently in

168
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,979
development which will use proof of

169
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,960
State blockchain instead of proof of

170
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,720
work proof of stake blocks require less

171
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,819
computing power electricity and proof of

172
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,120
work the crypto Pros advertises as being

173
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,639
environmentally friendly but I beg to

174
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,479
differ

175
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,819
proof of State requires about a third of

176
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,919
the energy of proof of work according to

177
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,039
a study by the University of London a

178
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,800
brief description from Wikipedia so for

179
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,180
a blockchain transaction to be

180
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,740
recognized it must be appended to the

181
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,780
blockchain validators carry out this

182
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,699
depending on most protocols they receive

183
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,460
a reward for doing so which is called

184
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,020
the gas

185
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,259
so that's it costs money it costs money

186
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,139
out of your wallet to

187
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,539
to undergoing these transactions that

188
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,520
doesn't get stored as money that you can

189
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,500
spend and that amount of money is called

190
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,819
gas

191
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,620
so for the blockchain to remain secure

192
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,539
it must have a mechanism to prevent a

193
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,340
malicious user or group from taking over

194
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,819
a majority of validation proof of

195
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,860
stake accomplishes this by requiring

196
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,720
that validators of some quality of

197
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,000
blockchain tokens requiring potential

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
attackers to acquire a large fraction of

199
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,379
the tokens on the blockchains about an

200
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,280
attack

201
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,860
proof of work and other commonly used

202
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,020
consensus mechanism is a validation of

203
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,759
computational pro is to verify

204
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,440
transactions

205
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,260
so proof of work is a little more robust

206
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,659
to prove a stake proof of work is a lot

207
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,500
more commonly implemented in blockchains

208
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,700
produces a lot more pollution too

209
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,380
because it requires a lot more

210
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,440
electricity but Provost stake is not

211
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,600
environmentally friendly either

212
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,160
and what we have here uh the our

213
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,019
environment is rapidly disintegrating

214
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,300
the temperatures of the globe just keep

215
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,000
going up and up and here's an example

216
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
from a news story here basically the the

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,060
Arctic and the Antarctic or rapidly

218
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,540
getting more and more remote team and

219
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,760
our Earth is going to be in a really

220
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,180
hellish State sooner than you think and

221
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,820
this can't keep going on

222
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,160
so here's a chart that I found that

223
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,560
basically describes the about pollution

224
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,019
generated by a bunch of nft related

225
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,380
transactions on a blockchain

226
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,980
and that's not very that's pretty scary

227
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,920
I think so at even a third of the power

228
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,839
consumption approved work proof of stake

229
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,279
still requires a hell of a lot of

230
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,380
electricity and it's an amount that will

231
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,880
grow it's a number of transactions in

232
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,980
the validated crows blockchains are

233
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,899
killing the planet because the vast

234
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,640
majority of electrical power generation

235
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,060
produces air pollution

236
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,620
nuclear wind hydroelectric infusion

237
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,779
power will not be the majority of

238
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,060
sources of power generation in the next

239
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,260
few decades

240
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,240
basically we're doomed

241
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,100
so the amount of pollution caused by

242
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,720
power generation would be significantly

243
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,040
less without the existence of

244
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,560
cryptocurrency and nft blockchains to

245
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,839
produce lots of money for nothing money

246
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,820
that isn't generated by the value of

247
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,519
Labor or physical resources

248
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,620
so the money lust to these greedy crypto

249
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,660
bro Fat Cats is contributing to climate

250
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,580
change and killing the planet

251
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,580
I mentioned Antarctica has been ordered

252
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,240
to be melting rapidly as we speak

253
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,940
so what is an nft and I'm glad to see

254
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,920
that interest in them is waiting by the

255
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,339
way so an nft is a non-fungible token

256
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,260
it's when a block of the blockchain is

257
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,600
used to store the address of an Internet

258
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,660
resource now you'll hear people say that

259
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,839
buying nft is buying a JPEG but you're

260
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,620
not buying a JPEG you're buying a URL to

261
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,740
a JPEG that I could easily find with

262
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,240
Google image search

263
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,579
saying take you get a URL of a

264
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:57,959
particular image from Google image

265
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,420
search or from any other means that you

266
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,220
want on the web

267
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,260
and that is no different from the

268
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,620
content in an nft so you're not even

269
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,779
buying a JPEG you're buying a URL

270
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,959
actually you're not buying a URL you're

271
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,420
buying a receipt that says that you own

272
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,360
the URL but you actually don't

273
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,480
the absolute best description of what an

274
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,459
nft is was posted on Tumblr a while back

275
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,680
by quercing this I'll just quickly read

276
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,740
this out so imagine if you went up to

277
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,079
the Mona Lisa and you were like I'd like

278
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,120
to own this and somebody nearby went

279
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,240
give me 65 million dollars and I'll burn

280
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
down an unspecified amount of the Amazon

281
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,560
rainforest in order to give you this

282
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,779
receipt of purchase so you paid them and

283
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,760
they went here's your receipt thank you

284
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,800
for your purchase and you went to an

285
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,260
unmarked Supply Closet in the back of

286
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,660
the museum and posted a handmade label

287
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,200
inside of it that said mobile Visa

288
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,839
currently owned by Jacob Galapagos so if

289
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,519
anybody wants to know who owns it

290
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,260
they'll have to find this is in the

291
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,480
closet in this specific hallway and look

292
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,220
behind the correct rooms that's

293
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,339
basically how blockchain interests faces

294
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,860
with it and so you went can I take the

295
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,380
Mona Lisa home now and they went oh God

296
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,360
no are you stupid you only bought the

297
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,640
receipt that says you own it you didn't

298
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,980
actually buy the Mona Lisa itself you

299
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,660
can't take the real moment we see you

300
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,880
idiot you can't take this though and

301
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,860
gave you a replica print in a cardboard

302
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,560
tube that sold in the gift shop and

303
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,600
basically we could get that for anything

304
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,060
just by right clicking on an image and

305
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,320
saving it

306
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,300
so also the person selling you their

307
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,339
seat approaches has at no point in any

308
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,700
time ever owned the Mona Lisa now if

309
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,500
this doesn't make any sense or seems

310
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,240
like any logical person would be happy

311
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
with this exchange then you've

312
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
understood it perfectly thank you

313
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,660
Christmas there's a reason why this post

314
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,260
has been shared a few times

315
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,600
so Adel Dash was the guy or one of the

316
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
guys who came up with the original

317
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,000
concept of nfts and in the Atlantic a

318
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,420
while back he discussed his regrets for

319
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,100
inventing this

320
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,779
I'm not going to read the whole thing

321
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,779
but I'll skim through it for you so if

322
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,579
you liked an artwork would you pay more

323
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,200
for it just because somebody included

324
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,360
its name in the spreadsheet I probably

325
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,339
wouldn't but once you leave aside the

326
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,320
technical details of nfts putting

327
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,420
artworks in the blockchain is listening

328
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,579
to an option catalog it adds a measure

329
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,019
of certainty about the work being

330
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,019
considered by default a digital image or

331
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,339
video or perfect replicas

332
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,200
indistinguishable from the original down

333
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,660
to its bits and bytes

334
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,060
so you couldn't store the actual artwork

335
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,040
in the blockchain because of technical

336
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,019
limits as I said

337
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,800
the capacity for a block on the ethereum

338
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,040
blockchain is has a maximum capacity of

339
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,620
one megabyte so a lot of images are a

340
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,899
lot larger than one megabyte

341
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,779
so records in most blockchains are too

342
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,880
small to hold an entire image many

343
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,500
people suggested that rather than trying

344
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,420
to shoehorn the wall artwork into the

345
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,220
blockchain you could just include the

346
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,500
web address of an image or perhaps a

347
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,779
mathematical compression of the work and

348
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,100
use it to reference the artwork

349
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,680
elsewhere we took that shortcut because

350
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,779
we were running out of time seven years

351
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,700
later all of today's popular nft

352
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,459
platforms to use the same shortcut that

353
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,320
means when someone else buys an NFC

354
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,240
they're not buying the actual digital

355
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,760
artwork they're buying a link to it and

356
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,320
worse they're buying a link that in many

357
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,300
cases lives on the website of a new

358
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,399
startup that's likely to fail in a few

359
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,260
years

360
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,199
so here's how the ownership of a digital

361
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,120
graphic works so according to

362
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,399
intellectual property law the creator of

363
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,899
the original graphic has the

364
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,240
intellectual property rights according

365
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,920
to computer networking access control

366
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,440
the administrator of a web server which

367
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,839
is hosting the image as access control

368
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,420
the web server administrator May delete

369
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,300
the image at any time so in no way

370
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,000
either intellectual property law or your

371
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,459
ability to control the image on that web

372
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,639
server does nft Grant any sort of

373
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,079
ownership

374
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,779
so it's basically like those Moon Deeds

375
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,300
that used to be sold where there's no

376
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,339
legal framework to establish the

377
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,860
ownership of land on the Moon

378
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,139
so meanwhile loads of nft brokes have

379
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,519
been stealing the artwork of original

380
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,399
creators who saw a sign of teas it's so

381
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,620
bad that deviantART as a feature to help

382
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,540
artists discover if their art is being

383
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,600
stolen for nfts artists have been loud

384
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,120
and clear about this don't buy nfts pay

385
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,100
us commission for our work we can even

386
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,320
create something original for you

387
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,660
so of course the administrator of a web

388
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,699
server can delete an image on their web

389
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,699
server anytime but if you want a copy of

390
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,519
that image and you right click saved it

391
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,399
onto your hard drive then the

392
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,500
administrator can delete the image from

393
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,540
their web server but they can't delete

394
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,120
it from your hard drive so it's the one

395
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,199
way to have a copy of the jpeg

396
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,079
so this is why nft boats hate the whole

397
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,959
right click save thing so much

398
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,800
and this just illustrates how confused

399
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,380
the love nft Bros about are about what

400
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,740
how ownership of digital media works so

401
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,800
here's a story from web series going to

402
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,560
spray which I have a lot of uh images

403
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,800
for this presentation

404
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,120
so basically this uh group spice Diego

405
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,019
thought that by buying a a printed media

406
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,240
related to Dune that they owned the

407
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,699
intellectual property therein

408
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,860
like you know if you buy one of my books

409
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,959
you don't have the intellectual property

410
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,620
to my book if you buy a DVD of Star Wars

411
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,019
you don't own the intellectual property

412
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,240
of Star Wars obviously

413
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,959
so yeah this just illustrates how

414
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,120
confused a lot of these nft Bros are

415
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,220
about what image ownership of the

416
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,339
intellectual property really is

417
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,380
and this illustrates you know all these

418
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,679
nft Bros talking about oh but we're

419
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,959
developing more uh environmentally

420
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,140
friendly Technologies well you

421
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,020
developers have been working on ethereum

422
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,559
2.0 which uses proof of stake instead of

423
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,959
proof of work and therefore consuming

424
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,599
less electricity for a while and they

425
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,640
still haven't been able to Launch

426
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,360
the 30 energy consumption proof of stake

427
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
version yet and it might never come out

428
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,760
and even then proof of stake still

429
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,860
consumes an awful lot of electricity so

430
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,860
it's just lose lose kill the planet all

431
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,480
the way down

432
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,780
yeah Wikipedia community

433
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,000
requests for the Wikipedia Foundation to

434
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,380
no longer accept cryptocurrency

435
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,480
donations

436
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,799
it is so easy to steal money from nft

437
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,179
Bros

438
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,940
and here's an example of that uh the

439
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,720
Open Sea Marketplace all the time has

440
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,660
attackers intercepting it

441
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,280
and yeah

442
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
I mean

443
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,780
all the time cryptocurrency and nfts get

444
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,940
stolen and it's a millions and millions

445
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,380
and millions probably billions of

446
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,000
dollars where it's been stolen at this

447
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,740
point

448
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,960
another example of a very expensive

449
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,179
these stuffs like this story go on

450
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,299
multiple times every single day

451
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,059
and you know a lot of nft Bros and

452
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,580
crypto Bros they think well we can't be

453
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,799
traced if we use cryptocurrency and

454
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,500
that's wrong because Federal authorities

455
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,220
obviously were able to seize Bitcoin

456
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,860
that they believed was involved in a

457
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,820
crime

458
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,220
so it's not true that law enforcement

459
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,020
can't trace your cryptocurrency

460
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,200
transactions they can and they can get

461
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,140
their money back sometimes too

462
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,039
and here's another loser example so the

463
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,740
guy who spent almost three million

464
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,860
dollars buying an nft of the very first

465
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,799
tweet could even get three hundred

466
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,220
dollars for it recently

467
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,080
so now let's get into agriculture very

468
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,679
briefly agriculture is not spend a [ __ ]

469
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,740
ton of money for this information or

470
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,140
this digital entity or whatever or

471
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,660
Digital Image it's knowledge should be

472
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,140
free the free exchange of information

473
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,220
the free software movement is

474
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,760
agriculture it existed since the 1970s

475
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,039
so Tim berners-lead banks in the world

476
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,679
wide web in 1990 in order to share his

477
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,660
documentation sure the internet while he

478
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,539
was working at CERN all open source

479
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,120
public accessible Open Standards like

480
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,780
HTTP and HTML the dream of hackers is to

481
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,700
share information and art freely with

482
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,280
everyone free to access free to use free

483
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,500
of charge humanity and the Sciences

484
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,480
could Advance much faster if everyone

485
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,120
shares what they know nfts are

486
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,340
identifical to the spirit of Agriculture

487
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,520
nft Bros want what is free such as

488
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,520
hugeographic on the web to be monetized

489
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,520
if lft Bros could monetize the oxygen we

490
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,799
breathe they would it's a scary

491
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,620
implications of course nfts Grant no

492
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,440
ownership or access to images grm that

493
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,299
corporations use to make us pay for

494
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,700
video games movies music books and so on

495
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,840
at least Grant access to its media nfts

496
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,940
Grant access to nothing you're paying

497
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,980
for nothing nfts have been correctly

498
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,760
called DRM without content DRM for

499
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,260
nothing

500
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,080
so this has really I'm glad that more

501
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,820
and more people are waking up to the

502
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,600
idea that nfts are total [ __ ] so my

503
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,179
concern at this point is the next big

504
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,280
crypto growth scan everyone falls

505
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,520
through it again so look out for the

506
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,980
next version of nfts they might call it

507
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,440
something completely different but I

508
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,140
guarantee you it's a scam and probably

509
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,299
killing our planet as well

510
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,280
so we're just going to briefly get into

511
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,880
Aaron Swartz who is rightfully a hero of

512
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,580
hacker culture and he died in his quest

513
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,799
to make knowledge free

514
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,020
so I'm not going to read his entire

515
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,620
Wikipedia biography here

516
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,679
but you know he was a young man just

517
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,440
slightly younger than I was he was

518
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,020
involved in the development of a lot of

519
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,419
really important open technologies that

520
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,120
we benefit from to this day including

521
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,679
RSS

522
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,780
he was involved in the invention of that

523
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,179
the markdown publishing format the

524
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,179
organization Creative Commons which

525
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,000
gives a framework for sharing media

526
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,020
freely the website framework web.pi and

527
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,240
he joined Reddit six months after his

528
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,120
founding notice these are all entities

529
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,780
about the free free of charge and freely

530
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,240
available exchange for information

531
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,539
so in 2011 Swartz was arrested by

532
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,340
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

533
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,400
police basically because he was using

534
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,820
his access to the MIT Network to make

535
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,059
jstor probably accessible to everyone

536
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:21,720
jstor is a massive database of academic

537
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,179
journals keep in mind the academics that

538
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,220
do the academic research that end up in

539
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,100
these academic journals do not get paid

540
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,559
for their work being a jstor and other

541
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,320
systems like that and he wanted to make

542
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,659
all the science and knowledge freely

543
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,340
accessible to everyone

544
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,100
and that's what he was arrested for and

545
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,799
primitively tried for and eventually

546
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,780
years of this criminal prosecution were

547
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,260
so stressful for Mr Swartz that he

548
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,240
committed suicide

549
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,720
and then a little after he when he

550
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,299
committed suicide he was posthumously

551
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,400
entered into the internet Hall of Fame

552
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,419
and rightfully so so this man died to

553
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,480
make knowledge freely accessible

554
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,760
here's a new story in the guardian about

555
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,140
him

556
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,380
rest in peace Aaron Swartz by the way

557
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,679
and if anyone doubts how Aaron Swartz

558
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,799
would think about nfts and any other

559
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,840
scan that these crypto boats come up

560
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,240
with here's some quotes from him so

561
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,100
information is power but like all power

562
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,600
there are those who want to keep it to

563
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,940
themselves with enough of us around the

564
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,679
world we'll not just send a strong

565
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,360
message approach opposing the

566
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,460
privatization of knowledge will make a

567
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,740
thing of the past but all this action

568
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,020
goes on the dark in underground it's

569
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,480
called stealing or piracy as if sharing

570
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,980
a wealth of knowledge where the moral

571
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,419
equivalent of plundering the ship and

572
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,240
murdering it's occupants but sharing

573
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,280
isn't immoral it's a moral imperative

574
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,860
only those blinded by read would refuse

575
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,440
to let a friend make a copy and you can

576
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,740
make a copy by right clicking on an

577
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,179
image by the way

578
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,760
so we need to take information wherever

579
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,860
it's stored maker copies and share them

580
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,200
with the world we need to make stuff

581
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,940
that's out of copyright and add it to

582
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,400
the archive we need to buy secret

583
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,980
databases and put them on the web we

584
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,840
need to download scientific journals and

585
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,640
upload them to file sharing networks

586
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,919
with enough of us around the world we'll

587
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,780
not just send a strong message opposing

588
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,000
a privatization of knowledge we'll make

589
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,340
it a thing of the past will you join us

590
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,760
and this is all antifical to nfts and

591
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,400
anything similar like that

592
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,100
again you can just say right click on

593
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,380
images and you have a permanent copy on

594
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,059
your hard drive

595
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:42,659
so I'm gonna I'm sorry about the fire

596
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,520
alarm my building but we're just gonna

597
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,460
tie up this presentation so I say right

598
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,220
click on nfts right click on as many

599
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,020
things on the web as you possibly can

600
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,600
share knowledge code and data freely

601
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,940
know it should be free that's the hacker

602
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,640
ethos hack the planet because nfts

603
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,380
cryptocurrency and blockchain are

604
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,020
killing the planet honor Aaron Schwartz

605
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,840
by not succumbing to nft broker crypto

606
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,539
