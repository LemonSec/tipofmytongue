1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,899
so thank you all for peeling yourselves

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,620
out of uh perfectly warm beds to uh come

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,559
here about this it is a topic near and

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,560
dear to my heart and it's a follow-on as

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,779
many of my talks are it's a follow-on to

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,960
things that I've said before so I was in

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,539
Reno and I talked a little bit about

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,699
some of this stuff

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,060
but you know the game keeps moving and

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,120
and yet it's the same players with the

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,520
same goals

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,760
so this is kind of a mid-span update as

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,260
all of them will be

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,700
and

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,700
um what it amounts to just you know the

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,660
give away the the punchline is that to

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,700
the extent that we are torturing malware

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,460
to find out what it does uh that's about

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,059
to become a whole lot less useful and to

20
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,820
the extent that we are using firewalls

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,280
or network traces to find out sort of

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,659
what all of the Internet of Things uh is

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,780
doing inside of our homes that is about

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,659
to become a whole lot less useful and

25
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,360
for that matter having a firewall in any

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,119
form is about to become much harder

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,159
this is

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,159
deliberate but we are not the targets

29
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,180
let me explain

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,960
it's a long abstract here

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
um I could have just printed that handed

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,220
it all to you and we could be drinking

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,659
coffee

34
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,579
so

35
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,040
um we are already in a situation where

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,000
the network of networks that was the

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,100
original concept for the internet has

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,799
kind of gone away and the idea that we

39
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,259
each have a network that we pay for that

40
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,200
we then connect to something that then

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,180
causes the aggregate of all those

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,100
connected networks to be able to reach

43
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,960
various parts of each other and creates

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,939
this this huge Global thing that we all

45
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,659
uh I guess love

46
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,940
that has kind of

47
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,340
um we've gone all the way around we've

48
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,500
gone a full lap around the track and the

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,640
idea that we're going to build a network

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,160
for us that has resources that we care

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,700
about like file servers or whatever

52
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,980
and that we're going to be very careful

53
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,099
about who can connect to those and we

54
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,040
will also have desktops Wi-Fi that kind

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,680
of thing but that our network will be

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,680
separately useful than the internet the

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,000
network of networks that's kind of gone

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
we are all treated as yeah thank you for

59
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,819
adding more connectivity for the rest of

60
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,340
the world to be accessed from but you

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,000
know in general uh we can't get a darn

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,800
thing done if we don't have an internet

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,120
connection because there's nothing

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,540
useful on our side of our Gateway

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,099
um that's not the way this thing started

66
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,440
right there were networks that were not

67
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,180
connected to the internet that were

68
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,560
nevertheless useful as recently as 1995.

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,480
I know that seems like a long time ago

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,760
but I was there and it does not seem so

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
long to me

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
anyway what this means is if you want

73
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,459
effective security you're going to have

74
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,159
to go back in time uh if you're going to

75
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,860
have a modern Network you're probably

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,980
not going to have very much security and

77
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,459
you know we're already in the the mode

78
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,260
where we have uh no hope of really

79
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,480
examining something that we bought you

80
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
know if you have a smart TV for example

81
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,519
and you plug it in

82
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,560
you can't really evaluate the source

83
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,780
code or even look at reports written by

84
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,940
people who have

85
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,459
um you you don't know what vendors

86
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,720
you're trusting you don't know what

87
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,700
their supply chain is in fact if

88
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,159
anything you know that the maker of your

89
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,080
smart TV doesn't know what their supply

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
chain is and so you know something like

91
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
shell shock will come along and you have

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,799
no idea if your refrigerator is

93
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,200
vulnerable or not nor does the company

94
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,840
who makes it and so what we're doing now

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,420
is watching the Network to get some

96
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,978
sense of whether bad things are

97
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,660
happening we can no longer do anything

98
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,478
by looking at an endpoint we're looking

99
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,320
at a user right as we know users could

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,780
be the good kind that we are there to

101
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,880
serve but they could also be malicious

102
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,259
insiders they could be Intruders

103
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:36,000
there's a lot of users that we don't

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,060
want to provide services to and you know

105
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,620
there are a lot of folks out there if

106
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,780
you look at the Beyond Corp zero trust

107
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,419
model they'll say firewalls aren't

108
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,340
helping you you need to secure every

109
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,139
endpoint to make sure that it's

110
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,780
somebody's credentials rather than their

111
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,520
IP address that is what gives them

112
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,620
access to your stuff and that's not

113
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,560
entirely wrong uh just mostly wrong

114
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,100
because I can't secure my endpoints you

115
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
know I have a friend who works at Google

116
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,300
and they make a thing called a

117
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,180
Chromecast and that's used to make a lot

118
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,720
of TVs smart

119
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,639
and so I simply asked the question would

120
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,280
you be willing to swap out your

121
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,100
Chromecast for a cheaper chinese-made

122
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,919
equivalent of the Chromecast and put all

123
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,500
of your conference rooms in the hands of

124
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,240
such a vendor and I will know we would

125
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,160
never do that well that's what you're

126
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,139
asking us to do with your Chromecast how

127
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,759
come you're not willing to do it well

128
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,340
we're big you're small mic makes right

129
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,780
Etc

130
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,880
um so anyway it's Behavior it's what

131
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,020
they do and what that means is Network

132
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,660
Behavior packets and flows coming from

133
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,419
devices that's how we decide whether a

134
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,220
device is good or evil that's how we

135
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,919
decide whether a user is good or evil by

136
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,660
what it does because that's what we can

137
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,100
still see

138
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,800
and um you know when you think about

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,320
breaking rules which you know a lot of

140
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,060
us break rules I've gotten a couple of

141
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,699
speeding tickets in my life

142
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,320
um you'd like to know which rule you're

143
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,639
breaking

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,979
um but on the internet you know you're

145
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,259
not going to going to observe every rule

146
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,479
in the universe just because you might

147
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,400
send packets there you'll be worried

148
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,800
about the rules where you are your

149
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,419
attacker is not worried about the rules

150
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,759
where you are or the laws what that

151
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,759
means is that behavioral security is not

152
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,160
a good thing it is not a goal that we

153
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,560
sought it was a refuge that we sought

154
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,259
because nothing else was working and we

155
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,780
still had to secure what we could how we

156
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,699
could and so we were doing this thing

157
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,860
it's pretty cheesy and pretty

158
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,680
ineffective and

159
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
um what I worry about the reason I keep

160
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,880
getting on airplanes and coming to talk

161
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,479
to folks is that it's going away and I

162
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,460
don't know what the last Refuge is going

163
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,560
to be after this one goes away

164
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,360
but I want everybody to be thinking

165
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,819
about this it's amazing how much

166
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,460
change is in the air and it's coming

167
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,639
right at us that nobody who is outside

168
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,240
the ietf is even aware of and there's a

169
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,940
little bit of a big lie problem here

170
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,440
um the truth is so outrageous that uh a

171
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,300
lot of people when they hear somebody

172
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,580
say yeah the ietf is doing this that and

173
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,099
the other thing are you crazy there's no

174
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,840
way they could be doing that this must

175
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,419
you're joking no I'm not joking so you

176
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,400
have to find a way to put some

177
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,680
credibility in front of my words here

178
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,919
even though they sound insane uh you'll

179
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,180
see what I mean

180
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,199
now to review how we got here

181
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,259
um it was complexity

182
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,840
um that's it we can't we keep adding

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,900
more stuff more transistors to our chips

184
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,780
more chips to our designs uh more

185
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,840
suppliers for those chips

186
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,680
um it's now at the point where uh you

187
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,940
know if you want to build military

188
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,639
hardware for military purposes the

189
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,680
military has its own Fab because they

190
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,660
can't just go buy a memory chip from

191
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,460
somebody because they have no idea what

192
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,380
other circuits will be on the particular

193
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,860
box of chips that they got that's I

194
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,419
think one of the big reasons why Apple

195
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,940
has its own Fabs they don't make every

196
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,620
chip that they that they make but the

197
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,539
ones that are important Apple makes they

198
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,639
don't buy those because if you're buying

199
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,759
a chip yeah a lot of things get sort of

200
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,259
swapped around you know same chip same

201
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,299
same pin out the same capabilities or

202
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,799
whatever sold by a lot of different

203
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,419
companies under different names you

204
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,399
there's a book somewhere you find the

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,200
equivalent you buy the cheapest one yeah

206
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,219
that's cheapest one could easily have a

207
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,000
an extra 16 bit microprocessor hiding

208
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,320
under one of the Vias things are small

209
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,760
and that's just Hardware think about

210
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
software yeah you know you've got

211
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,440
whatever the BIOS is that came with

212
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,480
whatever

213
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,860
CPU chip you have you know you've got an

214
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,180
extra 32-bit sort of 386 class CPU in

215
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,380
every modern 64-bit Intel

216
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,019
or AMD chip that you buy and that's got

217
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,940
a version of Linux that was old enough

218
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,839
that we were still using floppy disks uh

219
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,820
when when it was crafted right because

220
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,240
Intel does not say Gee let's let's track

221
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,459
all the all the bugs let's try to track

222
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,320
all the fixes and just keep shipping

223
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,800
whatever is is working so as we add all

224
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,660
this stuff it means that the

225
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,300
combinations and permutations of all the

226
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
different state variables in the

227
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,700
distributed system are unbounded

228
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,800
um nobody knows everything like nobody

229
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,740
knows enough uh very few people know

230
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,740
very much at all and you're in this room

231
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,839
but most people who are doing this have

232
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,600
no hope of understanding yeah you bought

233
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
a smart TV that's fine don't put it on

234
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,940
your network right connect it to even a

235
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,860
Chromecast for crying out loud or a fire

236
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,860
stick which is I work at Amazon now uh

237
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,800
you would be safer with that than with a

238
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,500
TV whose software is of unknown Origins

239
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,000
you're not going to get the average

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,800
person walking into an electronic store

241
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,080
to understand those risks or to take

242
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,880
seriously what you could say if you

243
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,760
could reach them so what we have is just

244
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,360
this amazing increase in complexity that

245
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
is why site security is kind of

246
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,860
impossible in the modern world

247
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,480
so

248
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,019
you know doing this right is expensive

249
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,760
and the people who know what doing it

250
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,600
right means are expensive and probably

251
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,140
hard to get along with because they've

252
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,720
been under stress for a long time

253
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,380
um

254
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,180
and it what this comes out to is that

255
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,640
you you don't even take this seriously

256
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,100
anymore you know you're breached you you

257
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,560
don't know exactly by whom or how many

258
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,680
times or since when but you assume that

259
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,620
you are breached and you know a few

260
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,000
years ago the office of personnel

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,120
management who is responsible for uh

262
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,880
security clearances for pretty much the

263
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
federal government of this country

264
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,260
uh was breached and they knew it and

265
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,079
they couldn't do anything about it they

266
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,360
continued to operate for an additional

267
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,459
five months after they learned about it

268
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,519
because the alternative would be to shut

269
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,740
down the method by which security

270
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,100
clearances are created until we could

271
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,079
sort of rebuild it all from known good

272
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,820
software which by the way known good

273
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,620
software is a little hard to hard to

274
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,120
come by

275
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,120
um so yeah there were attackers from

276
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,279
China that were in that Network work for

277
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,440
at least five months that we know about

278
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,019
and they knew it and they had to

279
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,000
continue operating that's how

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,519
complicated things are literally only

281
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,279
our attackers truly understand what we

282
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,959
are running on our networks and our

283
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,640
servers

284
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,300
um

285
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,420
we ought to worry about that some of us

286
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,180
do and we've got to take some action and

287
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,720
most of you are but again this is the

288
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,060
this is how things got as bad as they

289
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,839
are after telling you how bad they are I

290
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,180
do want to remind us that to attack

291
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,240
someone means that you are at risk of

292
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,399
profit if you attack them successfully

293
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,079
you might get information you could sell

294
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,040
or whatever to defend you are only at

295
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,380
risk of cost

296
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,800
so the incentive structure is wildly

297
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,420
different between those of us who are

298
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,120
trying to get some Assurance about our

299
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,040
information

300
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,680
versus those of us the none of us those

301
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,839
of them who are trying to reduce that

302
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,639
Assurance

303
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,680
um that has always been the case it

304
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
probably will always be the case I can't

305
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,180
imagine any of us are going to get an

306
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,700
incentive contract somewhere where we

307
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,000
get paid more if we are unsuccessfully

308
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,820
attacked

309
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,459
so short of that

310
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:13,019
these are the the conditions this is

311
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,680
what will be true going forward

312
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,820
so the last 10 years or so has been

313
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,680
interesting

314
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,779
um in 2013 there was a lot of news

315
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,320
stories about a contractor for the NSA

316
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,839
who

317
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,180
made some disclosures he flew to Hong

318
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,040
Kong he said look I stole all this stuff

319
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,500
from the government and here's what it

320
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,180
is and this is what it means and I'm

321
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,459
angry about it and you should be too I'm

322
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,920
an activist

323
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,860
Etc as far as I know he is still in

324
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,260
Russia living I don't know what he does

325
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,480
for a living but you know he's in the

326
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,060
Moscow area because that's where he is

327
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,060
safe from extradition by this country so

328
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,060
not everybody thinks that this guy was a

329
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,040
hero

330
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,040
um but the ietf responded in a positive

331
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,899
way they said thank you for these

332
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,920
disclosures uh we are 20-somethings we

333
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,660
had no idea how the world worked we

334
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,040
didn't know that this kind of dirty

335
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,399
tricks is what every government has

336
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,860
always done throughout history

337
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,100
uh we the 20-somethings of the ietf at

338
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,100
that time are outraged that any part of

339
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,079
the world has ever worked this way and

340
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,880
we're going to put a stop to it

341
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,839
and um and they are that's why I'm here

342
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,180
there are two rfcs that's a request for

343
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,920
comments that is an internet standards

344
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,760
document uh one is 7258 which explains

345
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,740
the pervasive monitoring is an attack

346
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,660
and that we have to resist that attack

347
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,260
and 8890 was written by the internet

348
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,660
activities board that's kind of as high

349
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,540
as you can go in the legislature there

350
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,940
where it simply said the internet is for

351
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,760
the end users

352
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,500
bypassing the fact that some of us who

353
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,600
pay to build our portions of the

354
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,360
internet might not even have users might

355
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,959
just be sensors or we might really want

356
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,300
to serve some users but not others not

357
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,279
The Intruders not the malicious insiders

358
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,860
and that we The Operators of these

359
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,500
secure private networks at the edge need

360
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,720
the tools by which we can determine

361
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,880
which users we wish to serve and which

362
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,100
ones we do not

363
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,279
um none of none of that matters uh we

364
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,120
are the baby and the NSA disclosures are

365
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,459
the bathwater and we are going out with

366
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,980
that with them

367
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,240
um again I encourage you to study these

368
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,699
read these uh comment on these get

369
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,920
involved here is the fact that the

370
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,899
people in this room by and large have

371
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,360
more important things to do that has

372
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,420
allowed such progress to be made in such

373
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,820
a horrible Direction

374
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,399
um we need more voices who can say wait

375
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,500
wait I'm trying to secure something I

376
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,100
won't be able to do that anymore

377
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,860
if this particular feature gets added to

378
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,779
this particular protocol that voice is

379
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,139
absent I'm aware of these medians but

380
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,760
there are too many of them for me I mean

381
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,399
even if I if I had no other thing to do

382
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,440
in life I could not be everywhere I need

383
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,959
to be so I need you guys read these

384
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,240
things find out where they came from go

385
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,360
there be part of the next next round of

386
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,220
discussions

387
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,880
[Music]

388
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,720
um

389
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
oh I should mention that surveillance

390
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,360
capitalism uh

391
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,860
uh is

392
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,440
alive and well still driving the digital

393
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,639
economy and benefits obscenely from the

394
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,180
changes the ietf is making that make it

395
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,399
possible it make it harder for the NSA

396
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,560
to do the sorts of pervasive monitoring

397
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,740
the NSA is doing right uh

398
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,639
Comcast famously sued Google during the

399
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,880
first year of the DNS over HTTP struggle

400
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,839
and in their lawsuit Comcast said and

401
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,980
you know this is something everybody

402
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,599
knew and I thought it was pretty bold

403
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,480
for Comcast to be willing to say it in

404
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,579
you know in a court document they said

405
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,500
is Google and Comcast are both in the

406
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,319
advertising business we compete and we

407
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,220
both need to see what users are doing

408
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,559
and Google is acting in an

409
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,620
anti-competitive Way by encrypting the

410
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,179
DNS traffic that is coming from

411
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,179
Comcast's customers so that only Google

412
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,820
for 8.8.8.8 will know what those

413
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,700
questions were and we Comcast since we

414
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,320
no longer know what those questions were

415
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,179
will be at a disadvantage when it comes

416
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,500
to selling ads to our own customers

417
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,179
wow everybody knew that was happening

418
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,640
but that's pretty bold

419
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,400
um because yes isps are in a thin margin

420
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,140
environment they have got to do every

421
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,539
little thing they can and anything you

422
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,400
don't encrypt will be used against you

423
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,000
uh in by the surveillance capitalists of

424
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,520
the world

425
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,360
and this stuff that I'm describing today

426
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,280
plays right into that particular game

427
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,919
because there are plenty of companies

428
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,440
out there who either run DNS servers or

429
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,780
they have browsers or they have clouds

430
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,780
or they have all three and they'll be

431
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,679
very happy if no one in between their

432
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,980
smartphone and their service can tell

433
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,600
what is happening there because then

434
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,460
they will be the only ones who are aware

435
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,460
of the activity of that class of users

436
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,679
and you know I remind you this is the

437
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,120
information Age and information

438
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,240
power is greater than all other power

439
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,780
hours right if you're gonna impose terms

440
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,660
on someone information is better than

441
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,640
kinetics you will do better with

442
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,500
surveillance capitalism than you would

443
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,660
do with bombs in the long run right

444
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,539
obviously as we see in Ukraine right now

445
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,100
bombs are very powerful in the short

446
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,620
term but it's only if you know sort of

447
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,020
uh who you're bombing and what their

448
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,460
options are and if you can constrain

449
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,160
those options that's when the long-term

450
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,600
Advantage comes and so you have to

451
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,539
dominate in the information sphere this

452
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,280
is how that is playing out everybody

453
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,380
knows they got to dominate in the

454
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,120
information sphere

455
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,860
and a lot of people don't want to be

456
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,600
dominated or they don't want the NSA to

457
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,340
be able to dominate and they're kind of

458
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,080
doing the wrong thing

459
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,660
now uh the internet beat OSI stuff like

460
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,760
x dot 400 and x dot 500 and

461
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,919
x.29 and all the other itu protocols

462
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,720
that we're about to take over the world

463
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,460
when the internet woke up and said wait

464
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,039
we don't want that so all these internet

465
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,500
based protocols they got to Market

466
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,740
quickly because they were more or less

467
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,160
thrown over the wall they were the

468
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,740
minimum viable protocols although we

469
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,120
didn't have that terminology at that

470
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,539
time and they got shipped in open source

471
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,480
software to everybody who wanted that

472
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,020
and so we simply outgrew the competition

473
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,660
but that Simplicity although it helped

474
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,020
us get to Market first is not serving us

475
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,720
very well now in particular if you think

476
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,179
about email a lot of spam goes on there

477
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,820
a lot of unwanted traffic of various

478
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,200
kinds

479
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,480
um it used to be that there was just one

480
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,820
port that you would reach an SMTP server

481
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,059
on it would be Port 25 and now there are

482
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,760
several some that are encrypted and

483
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,080
there's one the submission Port 465

484
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,059
which is

485
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,179
um it's treated differently the

486
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,500
expectation is you're going to have a

487
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,660
firewall so that only your internal

488
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,320
users can reach the submission server

489
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,059
and the submission server demands

490
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,340
authentication you have to send it a

491
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,559
some kind of a login password or saml or

492
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,900
oauth or something or it won't let you

493
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,900
send email that could not impose that

494
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,940
authentication constraint on Port 25

495
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,860
because it was getting traffic from the

496
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,380
whole rest of the internet and they the

497
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,880
rest of the internet was not going to

498
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,679
know what password to use so we had to

499
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,140
split the system so that the server to

500
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,840
server traffic was on one port using one

501
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,820
set of protocol options and then the

502
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,559
user to server was on a different board

503
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,940
with a different kind of protocol

504
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,960
options

505
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,299
everything needs that every single

506
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,000
protocol we speak has to has to

507
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,220
bifurcate in that way we need that for

508
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,640
the web we need that for DNS we need

509
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,500
that for protocol of your choice

510
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,480
otherwise we're going to continue to get

511
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,320
ddosed by DNS or ntp servers that are

512
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,120
accessible to the world because they

513
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,280
have to be and are willing to answer

514
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,200
every question that they receive because

515
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,240
they have to do

516
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,620
um but if you start to say that then it

517
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,740
starts to look as though the network

518
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,539
that is at the edge of the internet you

519
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,100
know the internet is a network of

520
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,080
networks and it starts to look as though

521
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,380
the network has a place in the world and

522
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,600
that the user is not what it's all about

523
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
in other words RFC 8890 would say the

524
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,980
network is just a conduit

525
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,419
and you should not treat users

526
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,240
differently okay well if I can't treat

527
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,620
them differently then I'm going to have

528
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,220
gonna have a harsh life now

529
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,100
one of the other things that um

530
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,299
that made things harder to fix was

531
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:37,740
the lack of uh seriousness right Nat was

532
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,220
invented outside the ietf and as you

533
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,880
know most homes and many businesses are

534
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,039
using that

535
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,380
but at first the first five years that

536
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,640
that was happening the internet

537
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,860
activities board said that the internet

538
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,340
is an end-to-end device Nat is not an

539
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,140
end-to-end technology and has no place

540
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,240
here and they actually denied the

541
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,220
ability to even publish an RFC

542
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,320
explaining how that worked it was

543
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,640
something the world had to figure out

544
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,500
for for itself

545
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,140
and the same is largely true of uh

546
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,659
application layer gateways which you can

547
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,539
think of as a reverse proxy

548
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,299
um that's the the art the architecture

549
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,700
of this thing did not admit to the

550
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,500
existence of firewalls or any of the

551
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,480
other stuff that we actually had to have

552
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,120
in order to build the thing but then one

553
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,539
in the marketplace over OSI so

554
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:34,380
in fact the Simplicity was a lie so not

555
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,880
only does it not serve us well now it

556
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,799
never really existed it was just words

557
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,780
that were spoken

558
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,799
now you know I'm uh I'm obviously

559
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,539
complaining about this I don't like it

560
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,240
uh it makes things harder but I have to

561
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,340
admit that there was no other way to get

562
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,799
here than this if we had had to have a

563
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,100
plan before we could build

564
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,539
OSI would have won because they had a

565
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,640
plan before we could have had a plan

566
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,700
so we are here it's uncomfortable there

567
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,440
was no other way to get here it would be

568
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,200
worse if we were not here so hell

569
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,419
okay so if you're going to defend now

570
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,400
you are going to break rules doing it

571
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,100
there are not a bunch of things in the

572
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,539
Internet Protocol Suite that says yeah

573
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,299
Defenders can can do this here and

574
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,820
that'll help in the following ways uh

575
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,620
generally speaking if you want to do

576
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,980
something you're going to be breaking

577
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,780
the purity of the internet architecture

578
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,799
to do so firewalls would be an example

579
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,039
um but monitoring is also an example I

580
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,320
like to know what is going out of my

581
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,960
network in case it is like the source

582
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
code to the product you could imagine

583
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,980
that when Microsoft was in the process

584
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,140
of losing a copy of the windows source

585
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,520
code that they would have liked to know

586
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,740
what the payloads of all those packets

587
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,320
were of the camp is uh that's been

588
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,059
shrouded for a long time but what was

589
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:58,799
not shrouded at that time but what's

590
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,799
about to be is information about where

591
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,720
those packets are going I'll explain

592
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,140
that in a moment but let me give a

593
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,120
little bit of credit to the people who

594
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,820
are building all of this uh stuff that

595
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,740
makes it impossible to see what's going

596
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,080
on with your own network uh they're not

597
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,340
bad guys or bad people they are uh

598
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,559
they're technically excellent and their

599
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,059
heart is in the right place and they're

600
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,279
angry about the right things and they

601
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,020
should be doing something their passion

602
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,240
happens to be misplaced in this case but

603
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,740
that does not mean they are not our

604
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,640
fellow Travelers

605
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,880
what they're doing is maximizing signal

606
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,880
entropy uh and I don't want to get into

607
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,419
a long discussion of everything Shannon

608
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,000
talked about in terms of of entropy but

609
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,360
just realize that if you transform some

610
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,159
information for example by compressing

611
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,520
it or encrypting it you are increasing

612
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,980
the number of permutations of

613
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,559
microstates which could have given rise

614
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,659
to that macro State the macro state is

615
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,760
the output of encryption or compression

616
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,059
or something like that and you know with

617
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,640
low entropy the number of things that

618
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,620
could have given rise to this encrypted

619
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,020
blob is so small that you can guess what

620
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,380
it was with high entropy not so and

621
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,960
there's a theoretical maximum of that

622
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,200
type of information entropy and the

623
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,240
people who are doing this which were 20

624
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,880
somethings in in the the 10 years ago

625
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,700
they're 30 somethings Now understand all

626
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,140
of this this is this is uh this is old

627
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,580
hat to them

628
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,620
um

629
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,320
so the first place we saw this was DNS

630
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,980
over HTTP and the italics are mine

631
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,460
the RFC that describes it claims that we

632
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,220
want to prevent on-pass devices from

633
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,620
interfering with DNS operations

634
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,140
well guess what my firewall is it's an

635
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,700
on path device

636
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,740
guess what it does it interferes with

637
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,559
DNS operations

638
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,179
um I pointed this out to them because I

639
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,980
thought gee this is absurd do you

640
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,840
realize what you're saying and they said

641
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,480
we know exactly what we're saying

642
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,820
and they just said you know Paul of the

643
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,559
the 90s called they want your firewall

644
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,340
back

645
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,179
um

646
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,520
okay well you can have my firewall when

647
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,320
you pry it out of my cold dead hands

648
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,840
because there's a lot of stuff out there

649
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,000
but you know people can't believe that

650
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,340
they're bad people in the world trying

651
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,500
to do bad things who aren't the NSA

652
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,200
right it just it doesn't occur to them

653
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,400
that they're also criminals

654
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,220
so I tried to get a change made to the

655
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,159
RFC that this was quoted from uh quick

656
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,840
is a UDP based replacement for tcpip and

657
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,700
it's already in your browser no matter

658
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,980
what open source browser you're using it

659
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,039
has this ability in it in some prototype

660
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,840
form and this is the way the world is

661
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,980
going

662
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,820
um they're we're gonna replace TCP which

663
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,679
you can see what's happening with

664
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,500
something in UDP that you cannot see

665
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,720
what is happening and so there is a

666
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,760
manageability draft trying to explain

667
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,039
well if you're a network manager this is

668
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,400
how you manage this type of traffic and

669
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,919
it's like 34 pages of no

670
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,559
Jesus

671
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,500
and this sentence just called out to me

672
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,740
screamed out to me in in pain in agony

673
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,320
and I said I think what you mean is that

674
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,720
the quick wire image that's what TCP

675
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,120
would show the quick wire image is

676
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,419
specifically designed to be

677
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:41,580
indistinguishable from other UDP traffic

678
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,840
right that's what RFC 7258 and RFC 8890

679
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,020
told you to do why will you not admit

680
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,940
that that is what you're doing and that

681
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,340
is why you're doing it and there's a

682
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,320
interminable discussion on a mailing

683
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,779
list that I would have to stay awake 26

684
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,720
hours a day to follow and the ultimate

685
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,820
decision was that the sentence will

686
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,640
stand as written so we're not seeing

687
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,059
quite as much uh I don't know uh

688
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,700
boldness as I'd like to see I'd like

689
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,440
people to admit what they're doing and

690
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,240
that they're having an impact on

691
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,360
manageability and it's not an accident

692
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,860
this makes it sound like it's an

693
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,840
accident that your network is now

694
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,640
impossible to manage it's not an

695
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,100
accident but I can't find somebody who

696
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,320
wants to be an owner of that

697
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,399
so here is a TCP dump showing the first

698
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,740
two packets of an SSH session I

699
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,880
apologize for the IPv6 gibberish

700
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,039
um it's just what I got and there are

701
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,659
some things that you can see here that

702
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,120
are important in particular you look at

703
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,620
that Flags

704
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,559
on the first packet the flag is an s in

705
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,539
Brackets that's a sin

706
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,539
and on the second packet the flags is an

707
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:58,200
s dot in Brackets that is a syn ack

708
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,039
okay so you never see sin and act

709
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,640
together except in this one case and you

710
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,279
never see sin by itself except in this

711
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,919
one case and what that means is a lot of

712
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,200
us for the last 30 years have been

713
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,179
creating stateless firewalls that means

714
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,320
the firewall doesn't have to remember

715
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,020
what's going on it just looks at each

716
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,179
packet makes a decision and then forgets

717
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,399
all about that decision and stateless is

718
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,899
where you want to be it's because if

719
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:26,399
you're trying to hold State on every

720
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,399
open TCP session on your network your

721
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,200
firewall is going to run out of CPU it's

722
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,700
going to run out of ram it's going to

723
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,980
generate too much heat or it's going to

724
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,899
get attacked on that basis somebody will

725
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,940
say ah it becomes fragile if you give it

726
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,500
too much state to hold I think they'll

727
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,480
give it too much state to hold you do

728
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,340
not want a stateful firewall you should

729
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,720
go home and find out if you have one

730
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,360
because if you do you should worry about

731
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,399
it anyway

732
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,419
what you can do here is to Simply say

733
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,880
if the sin bit is set if it's TCP and

734
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,760
the sin flag is set uh and it's outbound

735
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,460
coming from my network going through my

736
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,399
gateway to the world that's a good thing

737
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,080
and it should go go forward and then you

738
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,480
don't need to remember anything else if

739
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,399
the same thing tries to happen coming

740
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,700
inward ah we have rules it has to be on

741
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,320
this port number or this set of port

742
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,640
number is going to this particular

743
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,679
server because that's my email server

744
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,659
and I want it to be able to receive this

745
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,399
type of sin packet from the rest of the

746
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,380
world because without this sin packet

747
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,600
TCP can't start up

748
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,399
but again it's stateless once you've

749
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,440
made your decision pass or fail you're

750
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,159
done

751
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,080
Okay so

752
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,919
everything that you see is hidden in

753
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,140
quick well I guess not the IP addresses

754
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,059
and the port numbers but everything else

755
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,000
in quick which will replace TCP is

756
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
replacing TCP as we sit here it's all

757
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,399
going to be gone you will not know that

758
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,980
this packet is an attempt to create a

759
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,279
new session or a new flow now you might

760
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,080
be able to make some decisions say well

761
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,179
it's a new flow I'm going to do flow

762
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:01,679
accounting I'm going to have state on my

763
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,779
flows and it's a new flow that was

764
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,760
initiated from the inside so that's okay

765
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,640
but that won't work

766
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,960
talk to me afterward if you want to know

767
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,659
why it won't work

768
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:15,899
so all of the stuff that we use and

769
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:17,460
sometimes I just want to know what the

770
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,220
window size was so that I can debug like

771
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,760
a path MTU Discovery bug that is on some

772
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,279
Microsoft server latest greatest patch

773
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,440
level they broke something I need to see

774
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,360
what it is seeing so that I can

775
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,220
determine whether what it is doing is

776
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,059
correct well me seeing that is not a

777
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,020
priority for the Post Snowden generation

778
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,340
so let's talk a little bit about

779
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,799
transport layer security this is what

780
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,820
makes everything secure for https smtps

781
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,100
and so on there was an older standard

782
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,159
called SSL but it's uh phased out if

783
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,419
you're still using it you just turn it

784
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:55,919
off

785
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:56,580
um

786
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,000
but TLS 1.2 is what almost everything

787
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,279
uses and by the way if you want to get

788
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,520
less spam just turn off TLS 1.1 and 1.0

789
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,000
and all SSL turns out spammers and the

790
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,179
botnets they relay through don't update

791
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:13,740
their software very often they won't

792
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,500
they don't speak TLS 1.2 so this is a

793
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,799
huge huge difference maker

794
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,940
um anyway

795
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,820
um it's possible if you run a Next

796
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,320
Generation firewall

797
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,080
to be able to have a policy that says

798
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,519
all right I see that there is a uh

799
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,220
SSL session that is starting up from you

800
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,019
know is initiated inside the network so

801
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,360
it's somebody's laptop and it's going

802
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,340
outside the network I need to know where

803
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,380
that's going well you you're in luck

804
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,559
because that data is not encrypted that

805
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,240
is part of the TLs headers in 1.2

806
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,580
part of What's called the client hello

807
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,679
and so you could have a rule that says

808
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,500
you know if where you're going is

809
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,059
pornhub.com then we're going to disallow

810
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,159
it and where you're going is you know

811
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,640
whatever uh not on the the deny list or

812
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,919
it is on the allow list depending on on

813
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,760
philosophy you can make a decision

814
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,119
um your ability to make that decision

815
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,339
corresponds to an ability for NSA to be

816
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:20,879
able to pervasively monitor so that that

817
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,320
ability is going away

818
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,440
uh baby plus bath water

819
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,780
um all they're doing is encrypting the

820
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,639
client hello

821
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,280
um because they have enough state in TLS

822
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,960
at this stage of the conversation that

823
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,339
they didn't need that to be in clear

824
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,679
text no one couldn't remember why it was

825
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,839
in clear text but what this in turn

826
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,580
means is that your next Generation

827
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,440
firewall is no longer going to be able

828
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,899
to make a policy decision about allowing

829
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:49,080
a TLS session to start up based on where

830
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,159
it's going and I think we all know that

831
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,199
whether it's cloudflare or Amazon or

832
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,920
whatever there are a lot of

833
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,420
cdns in the world and they have a small

834
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,000
number of IP addresses and a very large

835
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,520
number like in the tens or hundreds of

836
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,339
millions of different things that they

837
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,740
can answer for and what they need to see

838
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,900
is the host keyword in HTTPS

839
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,119
but they're not going to be able to even

840
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,040
start up the encryption if they don't

841
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,339
know which service you are trying to to

842
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,160
reach because it could be

843
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,380
www.food.com or www.bar.com they both

844
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,020
use the same IP address so this was a

845
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,880
way to let the encryption library on the

846
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,859
far end know who you were attempting to

847
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,480
talk to so it would know which key to

848
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,260
answer

849
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,320
okay well that's going away because it

850
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,380
was misused by the National Security

851
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,020
Administration agency

852
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,000
um

853
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,940
this is going to be a problem I'm told

854
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,420
by my friends in the UK that uh if

855
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,640
somebody wants to use company equipment

856
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,280
you know laptop Network Etc to re to do

857
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,740
their banking from their desk like

858
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,020
during a break

859
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,599
that is not only permitted and required

860
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,760
to be permitted and supported by the

861
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,839
company it is illegal to surveil it

862
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,880
so you've already got companies in the

863
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,400
UK who are trying to decide whether or

864
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,640
not to do deep packet inspection or

865
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,400
record things based on whether this is a

866
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,200
bank

867
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,160
because they don't want to be in trouble

868
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,780
with their regulator I don't blame them

869
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,980
I don't want to be in trouble with the

870
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,140
regulator either but this that will not

871
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,359
be possible you won't know when that

872
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,520
employee is talking to their bank and

873
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,060
when that employee is uh thinking about

874
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,560
changing jobs and going to your

875
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,760
competitor and bring in a lot of

876
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,040
intellectual property with them now

877
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,320
obviously that employee would be foolish

878
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,240
to do that from their company desktop

879
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,099
but it will now work

880
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,900
so

881
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,760
um go us

882
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,500
um

883
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,280
so we don't have good choices uh we've

884
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,560
been put in a bad position and we were

885
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,359
not the target of this we just happened

886
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,099
to be going where the rest of the

887
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,000
authoritarians of the world are going

888
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,400
right I am an authoritarian when it

889
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,680
comes to my managed private network if

890
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,079
it's my company's Network that I am

891
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,599
paying for

892
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,280
um I got an answer to my shareholders

893
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,520
about what I'm doing with their money

894
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,099
that means it's my network and I need to

895
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,660
be able to make decisions about what it

896
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,560
does

897
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,140
same thing if I'm at home and I want to

898
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,079
deny certain things from working because

899
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,640
whatever the kid hasn't done his

900
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,380
homework and we need to need to break

901
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,020
the that video game for a while I need

902
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,540
to be able to do that is my network but

903
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,060
that sort of freedom is I guess the

904
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,760
wrong kind of freedom because uh you

905
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,800
know when I mentioned TLS and encrypted

906
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,560
clients hello when that spec was

907
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,800
announced uh two years ago there's a

908
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,380
press release uh no it's a bunch of

909
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,320
press stories corresponding to the

910
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,000
Russian government saying yeah the the

911
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,220
TLs 1.3 thing you want to do with the

912
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,480
encrypted clients although we're going

913
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,099
to break that we're going to we're going

914
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,680
to stop that traffic at the border of

915
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,200
Russia because anything that the Russian

916
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,619
government cannot monitor is probably

917
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,720
illegal that's the way we do things here

918
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,520
so we're not going to let a bunch of

919
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,920
Plucky 20-somethings in Silicon Valley

920
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,780
tell us how we're going to run the

921
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,180
Russian economy and should I mention

922
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,880
that China didn't not have a similar

923
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,460
press release but encrypted client hello

924
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,740
also does not work through the great

925
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,320
firewall of China so there's going to be

926
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,359
a fallback right and all these different

927
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,400
smartphones and so forth maybe they'll

928
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,140
have a pop-up they'll say yeah you live

929
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,359
in a bad place you should move I am not

930
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,700
going to back off and use TCP and

931
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,099
whatever

932
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:51,720
because you should not have to live this

933
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,400
way there might be something like that

934
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,040
but those companies will not Prosper the

935
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,079
companies that Prosper will say oh well

936
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,640
that didn't work let's try the old thing

937
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,820
ah that works fine so we have an option

938
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,579
we can simply Force the fallback it'll

939
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,260
be a little bit of a performance problem

940
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,180
for us but we can do that we can simply

941
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,020
break I don't allow UDP through my

942
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,300
gateways unless it is on a well-known

943
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,180
Port going to a well-known place because

944
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,980
I've been worried about people doing

945
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,020
things like this

946
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,200
um and you know people have built full

947
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,380
transport layers on like the ntp port

948
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,380
where the DNS Port before us I'm you

949
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,880
know I've been worried about this for a

950
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,800
long time so I can tell you blocking all

951
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,619
UDP is only a problem if you play video

952
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,740
games and you can find what net blocks

953
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,839
to permit in order to allow video games

954
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,060
to to work so that's one thing you can

955
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,839
do Force the fallback

956
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,200
there will be some companies or some

957
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,020
whatever government networks who will go

958
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,700
further they won't just force a fallback

959
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,800
they will force the use of a proxy

960
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,500
they'll say okay we used to just let you

961
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,780
talk outside and we'd inspect it and

962
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,099
decide whether to break the connection

963
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,740
whatever that isn't working anymore the

964
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,380
ietf has taken that off the table so now

965
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,500
you need to set a proxy in your laptop

966
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,680
or your wristwatch or whatever it is so

967
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,359
if you want to get through the Gateway

968
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,800
you're going to have to talk to the

969
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,599
Gateway using a key that you have to

970
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,420
trust it is going to strip search all of

971
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,359
your data as clear text before then

972
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,220
regenerating the session toward the

973
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,420
outside world

974
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,720
because frankly that will be although

975
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,119
very painful it will be the least cost

976
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,260
option remaining I don't know why people

977
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,300
the people who write this stuff don't

978
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,980
realize that if we have choices we're

979
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,020
going to be rational about how we make

980
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,579
them

981
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,320
so

982
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,380
um

983
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,400
there's there's nothing easy here

984
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,920
whatever you do next is going to be

985
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,560
painful living with it painful doing

986
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,420
something about it variously painful

987
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,540
depending on how much you intend to do

988
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,720
um there's no non-painful option for you

989
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,339
now there is something that could have

990
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,859
been done differently uh which is to

991
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:12,900
just say you know the network is the

992
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,460
thing the internet is a network of

993
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,680
networks not a network of human eyeballs

994
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,140
meant to sell ads to them let's let

995
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,020
every Network have its own policy and if

996
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,540
the policy is you can't do that then the

997
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,800
user will know they're on a bad Network

998
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,960
you know it's why I don't try to get

999
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,640
work done when I'm in China and now I

1000
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,619
can't get it get work done by going to

1001
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,240
Hong Kong on the weekends either because

1002
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,520
they've they've they've started doing

1003
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,560
the bad thing there as well and that

1004
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,780
hurts the Chinese economy but that's up

1005
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,520
to them to do it's you know they have

1006
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,400
data sovereignty I wouldn't want anybody

1007
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,800
telling me what I have to do with my

1008
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,240
network I'm not going to tell China what

1009
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,460
they have to do with theirs

1010
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,480
um

1011
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,260
but anyway uh the idea would be uh

1012
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,760
negotiate

1013
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,240
because if you negotiate and you let's

1014
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,160
say the endpoint agrees to do certain

1015
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,339
things and then doesn't do them then the

1016
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,440
CSO knows to come after that endpoint

1017
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,079
with a fire ax if on the other hand they

1018
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,579
negotiate and they just refuse to

1019
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,680
participate I don't like the terms that

1020
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,079
you're offering me then that's fine no

1021
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,400
harm no foul but the 20-somethings who

1022
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,079
came up with all of this in the post

1023
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,200
Snowden era are in no mood to negotiate

1024
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,920
now this has some effects on what we do

1025
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,800
some of us in this room I've been known

1026
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,900
to try to reverse engineer some malware

1027
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,400
and one of the ways that we do that is

1028
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,060
we stick it in a VM and fight the Battle

1029
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,859
of trying to keep the malware from being

1030
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,560
able to detect that it's in a VM and

1031
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,780
eventually figure out what it tries to

1032
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,480
connect to and what it tries to say to

1033
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,700
those places and you know maybe it will

1034
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,260
have been encrypted but you know once

1035
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,940
you know it's doing that you can sort of

1036
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,220
single step it and find out what was in

1037
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,079
that buffer before we increased its

1038
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,520
entropy with the encryption Library

1039
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,260
um that is not going to be possible

1040
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,760
anymore you're not going to be able to

1041
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,460
figure out what a piece of malware is

1042
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,700
doing by watching the packet traces

1043
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,280
and if you could it wouldn't help you

1044
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,060
because all you would know is what a

1045
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,099
very high energy expenditure on your

1046
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,560
part would reveal about that but that

1047
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,240
will not give you a signature that you

1048
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,800
can put into your firewall and say hey

1049
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,780
if you see this it's the bad thing stop

1050
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,560
it

1051
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,300
so even if you knew what if you could

1052
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,920
tell what it is which you're designed

1053
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,780
not to be able to do you wouldn't be

1054
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,280
able to use it for anything

1055
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,400
but there's a bright side which is

1056
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,579
um if you block this then the malware

1057
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,500
that does make it into your network and

1058
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,780
there will be some always

1059
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,880
um is going to think that it's running

1060
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,720
in a VM because quick isn't working and

1061
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,300
so you know that malware has rights and

1062
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,500
it will insist on the right to not be

1063
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,839
surveilled no on path interference in

1064
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,180
that malware's activities and so if you

1065
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,280
deny it the ability to bypass that with

1066
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,520
quick it will not fall back to TCP so

1067
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,859
the whole malware universe is about to

1068
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,140
tune itself for an environment that you

1069
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,560
can artificially avoid so if you decide

1070
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,599
you're going to avoid this for perfectly

1071
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,060
other reasons you will get this benefit

1072
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,700
so

1073
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:30,960
um

1074
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,260
the M5 computer in this episode of the

1075
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,780
original Star Trek has just vaporized a

1076
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,640
crewman who is trying to fix a power

1077
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,960
conduit and has just created a uh direct

1078
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,819
connection to the ship's energy core

1079
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:50,460
because it's an end point and it did not

1080
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,200
like being threatened about what it

1081
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,319
could and could not do

1082
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,660
and I have not found a better way to

1083
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,960
explain what's happening with quick and

1084
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,700
TLS 1.3 with ech and Doh then this our

1085
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,980
endpoints have demands

1086
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,960
and perhaps you have questions

1087
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,400
his hand went up first

1088
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,500
the courage to kind of make clear is it

1089
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,280
courageously

1090
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,800
wind up obfuscate they don't want the

1091
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,660
clarity Clarity of the enemy

1092
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,380
I don't think it's collusion and you

1093
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,200
know we are warned and rightly so not to

1094
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,880
psychologize others you don't know what

1095
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,819
their motives are but I do when I have

1096
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:47,520
and I believe that

1097
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,599
um

1098
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:52,140
the absurdity needs to be one step back

1099
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,520
from the front line

1100
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,599
you can't I mean where they've said uh

1101
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,540
in the Doh RFC but they're trying to

1102
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,240
prevent uh on path interference with

1103
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,000
Dana's operations that's been widely

1104
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,819
quoted that's been made fun of and I

1105
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,160
think that the quick people saw that and

1106
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,599
they just don't want to have the

1107
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,300
spotlight on them

1108
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,720
and they're in no mood to negotiate so

1109
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,359
being a reliable negotiating partner is

1110
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:26,400
not a priority

1111
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,200
yes sir

1112
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,839
um what about the client-side about

1113
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:34,619
proxies like Fiddler or pure cropsy for

1114
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,960
doing malware analysis is that all going

1115
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,420
to be dead with quick two or

1116
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,859
no

1117
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:43,380
um some of those things uh do what I was

1118
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,119
talking about which is single stepping

1119
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,400
the malware inside the VM

1120
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,260
so that you get a chance to see what the

1121
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,119
clear text was before it was encrypted

1122
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,400
right so to to the extent that we

1123
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,099
already have the ability to see what is

1124
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:00,300
about or it if we watch it with TCP Dump

1125
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,780
It is incomprehensible TLS 1.2 with

1126
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,819
whatever crypto and so forth so we

1127
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:08,339
already had to go into the end point and

1128
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,740
say I want to know what that was before

1129
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,839
you encrypted it

1130
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,240
um and that's already possible and it

1131
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,940
will remain possible but in a narrow

1132
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,599
sense you consider for example that TLS

1133
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,020
is moving into the kernel modern Linux

1134
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,960
and FreeBSD servers have been enhanced

1135
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,300
by Netflix who needed to send a lot of

1136
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,520
movies to a lot of places and they

1137
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,619
couldn't just m map a file and use a

1138
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,660
single system call to transmit that file

1139
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,300
so they had to teach the kernel how to

1140
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,660
do encryption in the kernel and so to

1141
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,520
the extent that windows will eventually

1142
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,740
follow and Mac OS will eventually follow

1143
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,400
you your ability to find the unencrypted

1144
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,380
data is going to be made more difficult

1145
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,500
and you know if you think about how

1146
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,839
amazingly obfuscated the configure

1147
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:05,300
malware was back in 2008 2009

1148
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,220
they were doing scatter gathers so that

1149
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,560
the entire unencrypted buffer was never

1150
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,260
in one place

1151
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,180
and so you could still do it but it took

1152
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,700
hours of human Blood Sweat and Tears

1153
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,460
there was no way to say hey ai go find

1154
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,220
the unencrypted data so it'll always be

1155
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,319
possible to do that to the extent that

1156
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,640
you can but if it is a nest thermostat

1157
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,160
with a uh

1158
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,040
some kind of a supply chain poisoning

1159
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,819
that Google or whoever owns Nest now is

1160
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:42,420
unaware of uh I think it'll be a

1161
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,760
challenge to get that software into a

1162
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,980
simulator where you can do that thing

1163
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,740
so really we have kind of been pushed

1164
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,480
into the middle where we're looking at

1165
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,020
the packets and

1166
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,520
sometimes the the encrypted or the

1167
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,380
unencrypted clients hello that server

1168
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,560
name indicator was all we needed to say

1169
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,420
ah it's too in the bad thing nothing

1170
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,460
should ever connect to whatever that is

1171
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,300
I'm not going to permit it well uh or

1172
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,740
I'm going to use that as a hint that

1173
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,079
that particular thing needs to come off

1174
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,800
the wall and go into the test lab so

1175
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,380
um no it will not completely disappear

1176
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,020
it will effectively disappear most of us

1177
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,660
don't have the budget in dollars or

1178
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,480
people to be able to follow where it is

1179
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,960
going next

1180
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,119
Network

1181
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,040
why

1182
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,160
but if those protocols

1183
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,160
um

1184
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,960
will block and you have the thoughts

1185
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,680
about this or

1186
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,859
sure

1187
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,960
um a new device coming into this

1188
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,599
environment that is a new class of

1189
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,839
device like whatever uh Internet

1190
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,680
connected uh Cuisinart is going to be

1191
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,780
speaking six low pan or you know some

1192
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,800
other variety of really simple protocol

1193
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,200
and it is expecting to talk to a proxy

1194
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,079
to be able to get out to the internet

1195
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:22,260
um and so it won't have any fallbacks

1196
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,220
um

1197
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,220
but with respect to my particular set of

1198
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,160
rules uh what I do with UDP is I say

1199
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,780
look I've got some name servers that

1200
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,380
need to be able to answer UDP questions

1201
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,760
that come in from the outside so I

1202
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,040
permit that so if it's going to that

1203
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,740
Port that server on 453 or coming from

1204
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,280
that on Port 53 it's permitted then I

1205
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,800
have some recursive servers who don't

1206
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,480
get questions from the outside but they

1207
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,339
have to ask questions so they also are

1208
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,500
allowed if they're talking from that

1209
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,319
server to remote Port 53 or getting an

1210
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:57,960
answer that's allowed so if what you

1211
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,119
want to do is bypass all of that for

1212
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:02,099
example if you have a Chromecast it will

1213
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:05,460
use 8888 for its DNS no matter what it

1214
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,619
got from DHCP

1215
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:08,280
um

1216
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,680
so my solution was to Simply give it an

1217
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,660
888 to talk to so that it would continue

1218
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,599
to work ask me afterward after after

1219
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,980
this is over if you want to hear what

1220
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,079
what happened next

1221
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,619
but um

1222
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:25,200
the uh pretty much anything that tries

1223
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,300
to talk UDP

1224
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,460
Port 53 that is not one of the two

1225
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,339
things I just said I allow is default

1226
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,920
deny so if you want to get DNS work done

1227
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,480
you're going to talk to a DNS server

1228
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,480
that I told you you could reach and so

1229
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,280
that that avoids the problem that you

1230
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,559
were just worried about

1231
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,280
in the back

1232
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:55,559
the like the Etsy hosts or whatever

1233
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,500
hosts file in in some directory and the

1234
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,660
Deep directory in Windows

1235
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,180
um that is stateless because what you're

1236
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,400
doing there is you're causing the name

1237
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,500
to address lookup which is a library

1238
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,540
function that's present in some form

1239
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,819
everywhere you're causing that to return

1240
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:14,339
a value which is different from the

1241
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,800
truth for example you might say yeah if

1242
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,480
you're trying to get doubleclick.net

1243
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,660
their address is

1244
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,540
127002 which is completely unreachable

1245
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,520
and so you're just saying that's a poor

1246
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,440
man's ad blocker so what you're saying

1247
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,780
in that case is there shall be no TCP

1248
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,280
session or any other kind of session

1249
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,140
because you will not be able to find the

1250
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,140
right address and that is fundamentally

1251
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,960
stateless because to be stateful in this

1252
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,420
context means that the Gateway the

1253
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,760
firewall is aware of what flows are

1254
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,440
currently active and it's permitting

1255
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,500
things to be part of those flows but if

1256
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,359
if it's a new flow then it has different

1257
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,339
rules and so that statefulness

1258
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:59,220
is a recipe for for failure it's a

1259
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,400
recipe for pain and lost weekends so

1260
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,980
it's much better if you don't have to

1261
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,780
remember what you're currently allowing

1262
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,839
and why because you're able to stop it

1263
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,460
from happening in the first place and

1264
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,559
then anything that you didn't stop from

1265
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:15,900
happening is by default allowed to

1266
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,079
continue

1267
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,200
preparing and

1268
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,399
we're here to help you

1269
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,420
yes

1270
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,160
um and to that extent we should be

1271
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,040
thankful to the IAB for publishing RFC

1272
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,420
8890 and so I would say look this got

1273
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,540
published about eight years after Edward

1274
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,079
Snowden flew to Hong Kong it has it's

1275
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:57,420
starting to get traction uh you should

1276
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,579
go to your next-gen firewall vendor and

1277
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:01,500
say look what are you going to do about

1278
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,740
this and wave that RFC you will not be

1279
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,960
the first time that RFC has been waived

1280
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,760
at them but they need to hear it

1281
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,500
they need to hear that they're about to

1282
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,960
lose some of what made them

1283
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,000
competitively unique

1284
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,180
which is the ability to look into a TLS

1285
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,040
session and decide whether it should or

1286
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,220
should not be allowed to start up

1287
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,880
visibility being passe and all

1288
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,680
am I out of time

1289
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,099
very close

1290
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:35,960
yes thank you all for coming
