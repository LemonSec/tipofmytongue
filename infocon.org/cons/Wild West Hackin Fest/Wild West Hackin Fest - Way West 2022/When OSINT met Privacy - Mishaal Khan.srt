1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,040
welcome to 11 A.M in track 2 with

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,039
Michelle Khan When Oceans met privacy

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,760
sounds like a strange meeting

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,960
uses his cyber security background and

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,880
ocean skills to spread awareness educate

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,520
folks and provide actionable next steps

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,199
to help protect people and organizations

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,820
from threats they may not be aware of

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,800
he's a virtual CSO which is something I

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,420
just learned about today he's he

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,060
provides see so like services and

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,859
perspective to smaller organizations

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,720
that can't afford a full-time CSO so

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
he's helping small groups or smaller

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,100
companies with those kind of skills and

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,200
perspectives uh before they can afford

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,000
their own thing which is pretty cool I

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,879
think uh certified ethical hacker social

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,160
engineer the first Intel technique

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,379
certified ocean professional privacy

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,120
consultant coder and a general problem

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,260
solver

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,000
so Michelle thank you so much for making

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,920
this together for us today uh take it

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,379
away thank you

26
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,420
so today's stock is going to be slightly

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,120
different than what you would usually

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,460
expect at a hacker conference but it's

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,920
relevant uh I assure you I do a lot of

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,140
osun I've talked a lot about open source

31
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,180
intelligence and I've talked a lot about

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,520
privacy as well in the past today I kind

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,740
of fuse the two topics together and kind

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,100
of show you how they are related to our

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,759
community and as individuals

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,500
specifically so this is not corporate

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,140
related intelligence or privacy this is

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,000
more on the personal level and how we

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,759
can protect ourselves as Security

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,500
Professionals and people in the field

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,880
and not expose our data in advertently

42
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,299
so the agenda is simple you know I talk

43
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,060
about open source intelligence not the

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,939
kind hackers do more on the side of what

45
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,259
uh a pi would do or uh somebody tasked

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,540
with digging up data about you personal

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,899
information I do that for a living I'm

48
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,780
hired by many organizations individuals

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,600
to kind of solve their problems through

50
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,939
also through intelligence and I will be

51
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,700
sharing some of those uh tips and tricks

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,940
and what I actually see and then how to

53
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,560
protect yourself from some of those

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,379
things so privacy is a field not well

55
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,140
explored and not talked about a lot in

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,360
general we may talk about stuff like

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,940
CCPA gdpr but that's not the type of

58
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,239
privacy I'm going to talk about so

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,760
at the end of the day let's keep this

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,900
interactive if you have any questions

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,959
just raise your hand and um we'll we'll

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,480
talk through those but I'll I will

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,760
provide you a lot of proactive steps and

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,120
this is not theoretical

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,920
it's a bit about me

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,140
um Bibi mentioned uh a bit about my

67
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,660
background but I but I've started my

68
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,239
career as a network engineer

69
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,220
um I've done a lot of coding in the past

70
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,140
but I'm not a coder

71
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,480
um I've done a lot of pen testing and

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,459
social engineering gigs

73
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,099
um so I've I've dabbled in many things

74
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,379
in the past and the combination of all

75
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,260
of them kind of gives me that one up for

76
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,959
investigations when I'm looking for for

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,500
people or companies or whatever my

78
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,620
mission may be all of this helps in in

79
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,459
the process

80
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,200
so let's talk about

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,019
awesome it is not stocking a lot of the

82
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,580
times I tell people I do also in open

83
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,319
source systems or what is it I explain

84
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,700
it to them they're like oh so you Google

85
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,060
stuff I'm like not really it's it starts

86
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,159
with Google sure or Bing or doctor go

87
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,920
whatever or all three but it's not

88
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,980
simply stalking uh people do use it for

89
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,580
nefarious purposes but um Professionals

90
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,620
in my field use it for a whole bunch of

91
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,000
other things

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,720
um

93
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,940
typical information that people think of

94
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,680
when they think of ocean is you know

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,659
going to a people search website and

96
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,159
looking up someone's name or phone

97
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,319
number or email any seed information we

98
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,860
call it you know seed data seed info and

99
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,420
you'll get pretty much everything about

100
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,280
the person you know basic stuff where

101
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,980
they live what their relatives look like

102
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,860
um different addresses past addresses

103
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,599
history and this is easy anyone can do

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,599
this this is open source intelligence

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,220
intelligence that or data that anyone

106
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,680
can obtain without paying any

107
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,180
information or without going through

108
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,579
hoops or calling law enforcement this is

109
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,160
data that we need to make sure it's

110
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,380
repeatable so it's there's hundreds of

111
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,940
websites like this one shuts down

112
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,919
another one comes up there used to be a

113
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,680
famous one called people pipl.com it's

114
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
behind a paywall now so these come and

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,540
go but this is the essence of where you

116
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,240
start but this is definitely not where

117
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,220
it ends and this is what separates a

118
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,979
stalker from an intelligence expert that

119
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,620
is data at the end of the day this is my

120
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,500
goal I start in the in the center there

121
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,440
with a Target and I will go through

122
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,280
every single aspect of their lives

123
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,780
um which is not just their basic

124
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,880
information but it's stuff like you know

125
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,800
their social media profiles hidden

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,840
social media profiles how do I find

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
those I start connecting the dots I find

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,740
an email address maybe I've reached

129
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,800
password that password is maybe used

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,500
um in some other email address which I

131
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,120
didn't know before now I have a new

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,639
piece of information I can kind of

133
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,860
spring off of now that unknown email

134
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,080
address leads to new social media

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,620
profiles hidden for whatever purposes

136
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,000
um and then their background their

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,240
education a lot of these help in Social

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,620
Engineering so if you're doing social

139
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,479
engineering gigs stuff like this will

140
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,900
definitely help for companies and a lot

141
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,000
of the things are for background checks

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,780
like cases uh voting records

143
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,360
um there's even a boat registry out

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,900
there or vehicle information so you can

145
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,880
find all of these things all of these

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,919
things for free essentially it is you

147
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,600
don't have to go to any special

148
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,380
resources or law enforcement or Freedom

149
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,780
of Information acts foia requests this

150
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,820
can be obtained all you need to know is

151
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,919
where to find it essentially so this is

152
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,620
what I do when I'm tasked with digging

153
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,080
up information about an individual

154
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,660
there's a lot more and I simply tell

155
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,220
people the more time you give me the

156
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,720
more patience you have the more I will

157
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,240
find out about a person and at the end

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
of the day I find out so much

159
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,919
information that even the individual

160
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,560
does not know that that much exists and

161
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,300
something to be careful here is not

162
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,699
everything is accurate obviously which I

163
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,620
will share with towards the end of this

164
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,500
presentation and this information but

165
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,180
you have to verify everything you have

166
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,220
to be mature about it and not just say

167
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,960
hey I found this information online you

168
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,880
were in the Ashley Madison breach you

169
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,039
must be a cheater or whatever no you

170
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,500
that information can be in started the

171
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,900
Ashley Madison specifically that breach

172
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,060
people could sign up with an email

173
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,460
anyone's email and they didn't give you

174
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,680
like a confirmation email back so

175
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,539
someone can frame you and stuff like

176
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,880
that so you have to be careful how you

177
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,500
use this information there's a lot of

178
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,020
Ethics involved in this and that's what

179
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,020
separates the professionals from the

180
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,740
stalkers

181
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,819
so there's a lot of use cases I

182
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,680
mentioned a few but you can read down

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,500
this list I do a lot of Trace Labs

184
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,080
competitions which is a CTF for missing

185
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,259
persons so that awesome skills can be

186
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,599
used for that there's a lot of

187
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,520
Executives who contact me they're like

188
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,560
we have multi-million dollar deals

189
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,060
between this company and we don't know

190
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,699
enough information about this broker or

191
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,259
this person can you run a background

192
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,880
check and see where else they're dealing

193
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,460
or is this person person Shady do they

194
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,080
have a criminal record or whatnot

195
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,360
whatever is in the public so I provide

196
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,780
that information there's personal threat

197
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,979
assessments

198
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,020
um you know important individuals when

199
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,599
they're going out they need to know what

200
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,400
others can find out about them before

201
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,860
it's too late so it's a matter of safety

202
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,620
and obviously pen testing adversarial

203
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,440
emulation it helps there as well but it

204
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,539
also helps journalists a lot journalists

205
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,539
do this a lot to verify fake information

206
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,960
fake news which is pretty rampant in

207
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,620
these is

208
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,900
you can find out people often ask me how

209
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,340
do you get Social Security numbers off

210
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,139
the darknet or clarinet or some

211
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,960
databases I'm like this was actually

212
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,060
taken I dug this up a few days ago

213
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,220
before the presentation this was from a

214
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,039
court record on one of the public

215
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,960
websites uh of I believe this is New

216
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,719
York New York or New Jersey and this

217
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,820
court record had I've circled actual

218
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,679
Social Security numbers in clear text

219
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,620
for anyone to see I had to redact so

220
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,659
much information this was full of pii

221
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,440
family members names

222
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,779
addresses signatures uh you know this is

223
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,560
ideal for identity theft and fraud so

224
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,540
the government has all these things

225
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,220
posted up you don't need to look any

226
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,560
further into the dark net or some breach

227
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,839
databases for Social Security numbers

228
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,700
specifically I was actually surprised

229
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,160
they didn't redact this

230
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,220
and you know if you collect data

231
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,980
breaches like I do you will find stuff

232
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,019
like passport copies you know entire

233
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,959
directories HR directories of companies

234
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,760
um that didn't want to pay the ransom

235
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,519
and so the ransomware

236
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,480
um individuals or whatever you call them

237
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,399
they posted the data up there for

238
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,019
everyone to download there's like

239
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,240
cannabis companies with checks of ten

240
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,060
thousand dollars to someone there's a

241
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,600
University of California Market their

242
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,000
data was leaked with all the students

243
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,560
Social Security numbers you see the

244
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,700
first two columns are social security

245
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,240
numbers so a big thing people ask me is

246
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,160
like Social Security numbers we need to

247
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,300
protect them hide them I'm like you

248
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,000
don't almost everyone's SSN is now

249
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,040
pretty much public record at this point

250
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,380
so don't even worry about protecting

251
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,080
that

252
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,820
and then there's like these records uh

253
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,279
you can find online uh birth certificate

254
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,140
applications or actual birth

255
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,220
certificates if you know enough

256
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,040
information where to find it this I dug

257
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,260
up a couple of days ago as well so I

258
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,180
literally just Googled it

259
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,459
um and I found New York and Texas birth

260
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,040
certificates so a lot of personal data

261
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,980
is out there how you use it is what

262
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,019
differentiates you

263
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,700
but

264
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,459
what do we do about this

265
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,680
um there's so many other breaches which

266
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,360
I won't get into but here's some of the

267
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,220
not so common ones or maybe you've heard

268
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,920
of these but all this information is out

269
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,540
there and it can be used in different

270
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,399
ways you know whether you're a gun owner

271
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,760
or you own a Bitcoin account somewhere

272
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,620
you can reverse search email addresses

273
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,680
and you will find people in different

274
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,880
um you know through have I've

275
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,279
beenporn.com you can you can check where

276
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,720
those breaches are or where that

277
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,360
individual is in a breach and you can

278
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,339
decipher a lot of things one of my

279
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,620
favorite reaches is the part mobile data

280
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,480
breach and this was an app used for

281
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,260
parking your car and I didn't know much

282
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,000
about this I'm like yeah I've never used

283
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,440
it apparently I was in the breach as

284
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,339
well

285
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,560
um and I found out when I searched the

286
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,540
bridge my own email address and my email

287
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,700
address popped up my name was there my

288
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,500
license plate was there this is good

289
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,940
because you can reverse search license

290
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,279
plate numbers so if you see a plate

291
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,920
number anywhere you can hope that

292
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,600
they're probably in the this data breach

293
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,760
and if they are which most likely they

294
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,339
will be if they've ever used the app and

295
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,740
you'll find who owns the plate because

296
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,140
it's kind of crowdsourced in a way that

297
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,899
that information people entered it and

298
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,060
you don't need to go to law enforcement

299
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,700
for plate searches and stuff stuff like

300
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,680
this exists there's also websites uh

301
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,540
other websites to do that but people

302
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,220
think that this type of information is

303
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,019
not available there's actual bank

304
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,000
records I've pulled from breaches with

305
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,899
account numbers and stuff so there's

306
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,100
definitely a lot of information out

307
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,300
there that can be compiled about you

308
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,540
it's a great question Mark mobile do you

309
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,180
have to be authenticated not for the

310
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,040
data breach I mean you can download it

311
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,399
and

312
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,440
so I was in that data breach I didn't

313
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,300
realize that once I went to a different

314
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,339
state and I parked my car there and the

315
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,399
only form of payment they they accepted

316
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,700
was download the park mobile app and pay

317
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,800
based on that so I had no choice so I

318
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,200
did it I deleted the app you know but I

319
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,140
had my email address in there so

320
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,980
inadvertently a lot of people are in

321
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,920
breaches which they don't even realize

322
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,839
so what can you do with a lot of this

323
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,880
information I showed you a lot of random

324
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,399
stuff all over the place for the sake of

325
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,940
time but my number one concern here is

326
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,519
this information can be used against you

327
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,300
for leverage now if if I know all this

328
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,220
information about an individual before I

329
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,180
meet them

330
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,399
I know everything about the person now I

331
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,500
can use it as leverage let's say I've

332
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,700
looked through your social media

333
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,079
profiles and everything and I know

334
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,139
you're a basketball fan you're

335
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,380
um let's say Chicago Bulls fan I don't

336
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,899
watch basketball or other sports as much

337
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,180
but if I know this information about you

338
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,279
I can start telling you hey you know I

339
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,380
love Michael Jordan he's my big he's my

340
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,880
hero and stuff like that suddenly you'll

341
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,279
start liking me because that's what you

342
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,500
like as well so social engineering works

343
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,360
very well with open source intelligence

344
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,240
but then if I know your past information

345
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
about uh your criminal record or voting

346
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
records or other breaches you've been a

347
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,500
part of there are many ways that

348
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,920
information can be used against you and

349
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,980
so the number one basically threat

350
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,959
against you is leverage people can use

351
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,079
this as leverage companies do contact me

352
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,120
for digging up information like a

353
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,160
dossier about individuals they're

354
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,019
dealing with because they want to use it

355
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,100
as leverage so keep an eye out for this

356
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,540
type of thread

357
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,459
I'll go straight into

358
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,940
privacy so we we we're all aware of the

359
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,920
threats that are out there uh on the

360
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,680
open internet but what do we do about it

361
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,500
so privacy is not just about

362
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,079
disappearing it's not about deleting all

363
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,700
your data online scrubbing yourself from

364
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,440
the internet that's easy you can

365
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,600
disappear and it'll take a little bit of

366
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,120
time but that's not hard to do what is

367
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,180
hard to do is hiding in plain sight a

368
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,459
person like me who gives a lot of talks

369
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,639
online and I have a very light social

370
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,700
media presence on LinkedIn I have to for

371
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,700
sales for promoting myself for educating

372
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,980
people for for so many other things I

373
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,199
have to have an online presence

374
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,139
people like me have a higher level of

375
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,279
threat if I'm catching bad guys if I'm

376
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,560
catching uh stalkers or I did a live

377
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,639
demo

378
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,060
um on Defcon where I got a fugitive I

379
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,920
went to the top 10 fugitive list I did

380
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,440
you know my awesome thing on the person

381
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,600
and I figured out where he was and I

382
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,100
reported that person if that person

383
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,320
finds out that I'm the guy who actually

384
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,240
did this or other more dangerous people

385
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,680
out there they're going to come after me

386
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,600
so everyone has a different level of

387
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,579
threat so privacy is different for

388
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:18,600
everyone so what's difficult is how to

389
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,820
keep myself safe so have some

390
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,199
information out there but not enough

391
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,420
that they can get to me so what I

392
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,699
protect with my life is my home address

393
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,740
I don't want anyone coming knocking on

394
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,980
my door all the assets that I own are

395
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,019
not under my name so I'll get into that

396
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,079
in a bit my wife's name my kids names

397
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,019
whether they exist or not all of this

398
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,120
information is to protect me that's what

399
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,860
I'm trying to protect now not I'm not

400
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,320
trying to disappear from the internet so

401
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,839
there's a process to this

402
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,120
and you know for everyone like I said

403
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
there's there's different use cases you

404
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,180
know majority of the people there's

405
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,680
identity theft that they're trying to

406
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,720
protect themselves from that's easy

407
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,240
there's so many other things and I'll

408
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,519
take you through a few examples just to

409
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,639
kind of broaden your perspective on why

410
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,699
privacy why why should I really care and

411
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,199
you can be in the wrong place at the

412
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,300
wrong time stuff like this is called mob

413
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,940
Justice one people think that they found

414
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,000
someone and they're like uh this is the

415
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,100
person we got him on video you know a

416
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,500
retired Chicago firefighter was wrongly

417
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,740
accused of killing someone and what

418
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,500
happens is eventually the record is set

419
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,660
straight but it's too late you know this

420
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,699
guy was like he was a murderer a

421
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,139
terrorist it changed everything

422
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,880
according to his words his life turned

423
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,500
upside down because he was wrong

424
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,540
wrongfully accused of something because

425
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,519
some people who thought they knew oh

426
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,860
send identified the person his home

427
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,240
address and stuff and they had to

428
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,120
relocate or whatnot so lives can change

429
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,240
the because of

430
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,620
unintentional doxing so we all know

431
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,320
about doxing which is intentional but it

432
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,680
can happen if it's unintentional

433
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,860
and then there's all these swatting

434
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,020
stories you hear of people dying because

435
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,140
somebody called the SWAT team on them in

436
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,520
this particular scenario I think it was

437
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,720
a game

438
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,179
um kids were playing and uh

439
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,839
somebody called uh the call 9-1-1 and

440
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
said hey I just shot my parents I'm

441
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,740
about to kill myself

442
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,959
um here's my home address the SWAT team

443
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,520
approached their house and the kid

444
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,439
opened the door and the SWAT team opened

445
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,919
fired and he died on the spot so stuff

446
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,600
like this is real this is why I protect

447
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,760
my home address it's and the way they

448
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,679
did it they checked his home address on

449
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,660
these people search websites and it was

450
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,120
supposed to be a prank but it went you

451
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
know it didn't end up very well for the

452
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,840
family

453
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,320
so stuff like this is real

454
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,419
unfortunately the mindset today of

455
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:49,919
people is

456
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,860
either I don't care

457
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,059
ignorance is bliss don't tell don't

458
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,140
don't tell me about it don't talk about

459
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,539
it I'm much safer same thing insecurity

460
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,640
you you tell any security any

461
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,620
organization that you're insecure we we

462
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,840
did a pen test here's all your flaws

463
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,700
they don't want to hear they go in

464
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,400
denial same thing with privacy

465
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,260
um you know the the other thing I hear

466
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,940
is it hasn't happened to me you talk

467
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,539
about these things so I'm probably safe

468
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,919
when it does happen to you it's too late

469
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,140
people come to me after the fact a lot

470
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,419
they're like you know all uh all hell

471
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,160
broke loose what do we do I'm like

472
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,720
there's not much you can do damage

473
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,179
control is much more difficult so this

474
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,100
is why I talk about privacy and try to

475
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,500
educate people and saying take proactive

476
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,059
actions before it's too late

477
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,620
large companies spy on you as early on

478
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,660
or Google spies on you but they also

479
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,299
give data to law enforcement quite

480
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,919
frequently with something called a

481
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,799
geofence warrant where everyone in one

482
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,960
area let's say there's a crime in a

483
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,700
certain area and you have your GPS on

484
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,380
with Google services and everything

485
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,720
guess what you're suspect now because

486
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,320
you were in the wrong place

487
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,240
at the wrong time but then there's also

488
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
something called

489
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,700
um

490
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,919
keyword warrant so if you're searching

491
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,200
for stuff online and you happen to

492
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,360
search for an individual that's on let's

493
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,580
say the terrorist list or the watch list

494
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,360
for the law enforcement in that area

495
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,220
they will issue a keyword warrant and

496
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,600
said who are the people who search for

497
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
this person or this address because this

498
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,260
address this is a known person of

499
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,580
interest and now suddenly you're a

500
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,679
suspect for doing your research on

501
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,299
something I won't even go to the level

502
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,580
of searching for keywords like bomb or

503
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,679
terrorists and stuff we all know not to

504
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,140
do that without a VPN on but even simple

505
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,780
things inadvertently you can fall a

506
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,220
victim to

507
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,840
um search warrants

508
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,059
and then there's dangers of Technology

509
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,480
itself don't trust technology in this

510
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,299
particular case the cops pulled over

511
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,179
um this family because their license

512
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,360
spread reader uh misidentified the car

513
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
as a stolen vehicle but you know this

514
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,700
picture speaks a thousand words uh this

515
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,220
family was terrorized by the cops

516
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,400
because technology made a mistake

517
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,460
so in my personal guess my my cars are

518
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,380
not under my name they're under an LLC

519
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,440
or a trust so if anyone looks those up

520
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,179
law enforcement or something they don't

521
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,520
get my name at least they they get some

522
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,740
you know other name which I won't say

523
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:28,679
and then you hear about all these

524
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,539
stories

525
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:34,260
about hackers targeting people with OG

526
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,020
handles I personally didn't know what OG

527
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,000
handles were but you know Original

528
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,780
Gangster uh so this person it was on

529
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,240
darknet Diaries the podcast this person

530
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,320
had a

531
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
name which was like an animal or

532
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,940
something a short name and um

533
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,280
pizzas were sent to his house his wife

534
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,160
his girlfriend's house is uh

535
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,760
um

536
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,799
parents house in another state in

537
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,020
Colorado or somewhere just to pressurize

538
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,039
this poor person to giving up his

539
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,480
OG handle I believe it was Instagram or

540
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,559
Twitter

541
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,780
um so stuff like this happens this

542
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,520
person would have never thought that I

543
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,039
own a perfect name a short name and

544
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,840
someone's going to come after me for it

545
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,520
and find out all this information about

546
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,440
me and then not just terrorize me but

547
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,660
everyone else around me so sometimes I

548
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,220
think you know I tell my wife all the

549
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,100
time that I'm well protected my privacy

550
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,500
is to a level that I'm comfortable but

551
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,659
you're not my kids are not my you know

552
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,520
brothers-in-law's assistant law nieces

553
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,440
nephews they're not so if someone wants

554
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,320
to come after me I'm comfortable but

555
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,299
they are going to use people around me

556
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,940
just like in in this case so not only do

557
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,620
I need to protect myself I need to

558
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,960
protect everyone around me as well so it

559
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,340
becomes exponentially harder

560
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,200
another episode was about four upset so

561
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,940
I talk about opsec as well as ethical

562
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,059
hackers we need to have very good opsecs

563
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,280
in another episode of darknet Diaries

564
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,159
there was a person who sent uh he was a

565
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,020
hacker who just to start off he wasn't

566
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,200
doing anything good but another hacker

567
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,659
kind of uh

568
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,860
exposed this person because he was doing

569
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,780
a screen share and he exposed some of

570
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,640
his information so that other hacker

571
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,640
tried to threaten him and say ask him

572
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,620
for money and when he didn't pay he sent

573
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,980
10 000 boxes of USPS

574
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,159
to his doorstep crates came to his house

575
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,539
um so I don't know if you guys know but

576
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,679
if you go to usps.com you can deliver

577
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,460
those USPS boxes priority boxes to your

578
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,500
home for free I mean I've done this and

579
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,299
I've I always knew there was a chance

580
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,280
somebody would do this until I kind of

581
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,799
heard it on the podcast so this hacker

582
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,960
kind of he delivered 10 000 of those

583
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,840
boxes there's no limit so it's hopefully

584
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,780
USB yes we'll fix that soon but as

585
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,659
hikers we know there's always a way so I

586
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:55,799
don't want something like that ever

587
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,919
happening to me and it's it's a nuisance

588
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,460
at the end of the day

589
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,539
so security and privacy kind of go hand

590
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,580
in hand you can't have one without the

591
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,720
other

592
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,940
um so before we talk about how do I make

593
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,100
myself private you have to have the

594
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,919
basics in place most of us hopefully do

595
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,039
all of these things in the list but you

596
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,360
have to set up that secure

597
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,820
infrastructure with VPN stock puppet

598
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,820
accounts and you know burner phones and

599
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,539
Alias emails Alias accounts without this

600
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,640
you know I never do any investigations

601
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,000
without having all of this done properly

602
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,039
and for my own sake so it's a lot of

603
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,919
vendors here and around us who ask for

604
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,780
phone numbers email addresses and and

605
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,539
everything else be careful what you give

606
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,299
them because for their purposes they

607
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,559
just want you know more sales

608
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,659
Communications and stuff be careful so I

609
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,419
I hand out my Instagram my sorry my my

610
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:52,919
LinkedIn profile because I want to be

611
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,780
connected but when they ask for a phone

612
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,820
number no a random phone number is put

613
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,500
in the field because it's useless

614
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,240
arguing with people I don't want to get

615
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,100
my phone number because you you're going

616
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,360
to abuse that no we're not we're going

617
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,740
to send it to our you know online

618
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,960
database they may abuse it we won't so

619
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,600
it's it's a long trail so I just don't

620
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,220
argue I just give them something random

621
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,440
I have Alias email accounts which if

622
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,020
anyone asks uh they're tied to me but

623
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,700
not directly there'll be some random

624
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,260
Alias account

625
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,840
um which I will still get the email but

626
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,100
they won't kind of find me in any breach

627
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,900
so you have to have these minimum things

628
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,940
in place like device encryption and we

629
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,000
talk about it in security a lot but a

630
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,159
person like me who has a laptop with a

631
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,200
lot of Juicy information in it or hard

632
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,000
drives that I store breached databases

633
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,600
on if that falls in the wrong hands it

634
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,760
you know that information can be taken

635
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,500
in the wrong context why do you have

636
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,000
people's passport copies in your hard

637
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
drive uh I do Olson for a living I'm a

638
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
security person I won't probably have

639
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,419
the time to even explain myself so

640
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,039
device encryption kind of helps me with

641
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,480
that sure go ahead take my hard drive

642
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,720
you won't be able to decrypt it so you

643
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,700
have to take all these questions some of

644
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,200
these things you may think oh there's a

645
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,340
one in a million chance of this

646
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,439
happening but we don't take chances

647
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,340
so let's talk about something more

648
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,980
practical scrubbing how I did scrubbing

649
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,039
there's I'll give my own examples I had

650
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,960
a lot of information online before I was

651
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,140
like this before I was private but I

652
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,940
started on this journey to kind of clean

653
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,679
myself from the internet and that's what

654
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,360
I want to share with you guys it can be

655
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,140
done

656
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,659
I had some videos online which I didn't

657
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,700
want online there were me young videos

658
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,100
embarrassing videos or whatnot I just

659
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,240
didn't want them online for whatever

660
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,299
reason so you know I went to YouTube had

661
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,039
a few copyright complaints against the

662
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,179
person because the person wouldn't take

663
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,760
him down for the sake of marketing or

664
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,039
whatever so YouTube complied so I got

665
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,620
that so that's one success I had some

666
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,720
online government records I believe this

667
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,000
is opengov.us

668
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
um they collect data from llc's and and

669
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
all organizations I have a few llc's out

670
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,360
there but some of the old llc's had my

671
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,760
personal information like my old home

672
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,440
address and maybe a phone number and

673
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,940
stuff so I went there they wouldn't

674
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,640
change it either so I spread some

675
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,440
misinformation I edited the information

676
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,000
so you can see on the left it says

677
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,640
Mikhail Khan and the Han is a misspelled

678
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,740
so I figured that out I'm like okay

679
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,980
success but then on Google cache since I

680
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,020
do ocean as well I went and looked at

681
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,580
the cached version of that page and it

682
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,200
had my real information it actually said

683
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,880
Michelle Khan on the right and then

684
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,799
everything below that I've redacted was

685
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,720
the old information that I had spent so

686
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,400
much time to remove and it was still

687
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,460
there then I went on Google they have a

688
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,340
method of removing cached content I went

689
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,779
through that method and then I removed

690
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,419
that content so sometimes it takes many

691
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,820
steps to remove simple pieces of

692
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,679
information but when I went through the

693
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,480
process I'm like okay good success was

694
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,340
to take screenshots share it with people

695
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,320
so that you know people know it can be

696
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,840
done it's it's not hard it's just a

697
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,820
lengthy process

698
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,220
so that's you know step two let's say on

699
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,380
Step One is removing information opt

700
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,020
outs step two is kind of modifying that

701
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,000
information if you can't remove it edit

702
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,880
it you know let's kind of spend spread

703
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,760
some misinformation out there or this

704
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,740
information but then you can go even

705
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,080
further and just spread fake

706
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,820
disinformation out there so this is just

707
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,039
a test that I did so for those of you

708
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,159
who know what weigel.net is

709
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,900
um for searching ssids it's a

710
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,640
crowdsourced website

711
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,919
in this particular case I upload it

712
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,539
since it's crowdsource you can upload

713
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,760
stuff and they don't really verify it as

714
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,059
much I uploaded an SSID in the middle of

715
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,279
the ocean and I called it uh

716
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,159
Wi-Fi for mermaids and just this for fun

717
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,559
and it accepted it so now if you search

718
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,120
for Wi-Fi for mermaids you'll find that

719
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,080
it's in the middle of the ocean

720
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,460
somewhere it's an access point that

721
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,039
mermaids can use

722
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,600
so taking this into account you can do

723
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,360
it with your own on home SSID and spread

724
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,039
some misinformation around that because

725
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,159
your cell phones are beaconing out all

726
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,260
these probes about where you live so

727
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,659
those who do wi-fi hacking know that if

728
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,460
your Wi-Fi is on it's trying to connect

729
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,860
to your home address uh desperately and

730
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,299
it's sending out these probes so your

731
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,460
home SSID is being advertised right now

732
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,260
and if I'm capturing it I can kind of

733
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,940
pinpoint where you live based on

734
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,700
weigel.net so what I've done is spread

735
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,260
more disinformation went with my own

736
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,179
SSID and said no this is not really here

737
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,240
it's somewhere else I relocated that

738
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,279
SSID and the MAC address so you can do a

739
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,100
lot of stuff there so that's more

740
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,500
detailed this information

741
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,740
but then you can go on official

742
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,659
government records so in this case

743
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,720
Transunion and Equifax and stuff and

744
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,279
they had my information as well so I

745
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,900
don't recommend everyone do this because

746
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,580
you will have problems

747
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,400
um with um

748
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,840
not only background checks but applying

749
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,960
for credit but I didn't give a I

750
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,020
don't apply for credit for anything so I

751
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,419
had these entries which I've redacted

752
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:01,980
um they're they're not real entries

753
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,360
anyways but I just don't want you to see

754
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
what they are but there's other entries

755
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,919
so I I got so pissed everywhere you go

756
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,200
you apply for anything they it kind of

757
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,840
shows up in in Transunion and Equifax

758
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,720
and and Experian so I started doing this

759
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,400
information I went in some of those

760
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,080
credit card accounts and I said hey my

761
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,059
real address is this the two addresses

762
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,799
you see there are actually the credit

763
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,200
card authorizers

764
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,240
um headquarters addresses so I'm like

765
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,679
let's put your own address in there so

766
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,059
that you get the spam and I don't I

767
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,919
don't want Discovery or whatever is I

768
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,360
never applied for it but I keep getting

769
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,240
that spam so I said let's spam the CEOs

770
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,700
and your headquarters there so that's

771
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,340
what shows up um in that so you can do

772
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,740
that as well so there's no limit to how

773
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,899
extreme you want to go with your privacy

774
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,179
antics

775
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,159
but you know at the end of the day the

776
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,960
reality is

777
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,940
companies will not stop collecting your

778
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,340
data they won't stop abusing your data

779
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,399
you will always be tracked because it is

780
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,080
a billion dollar industry they make

781
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,720
money from your information you may

782
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,700
think my email address my name is

783
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,340
insignificant but it's not it's valuable

784
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,559
to companies and and this is all proof

785
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,820
and the surveillance Capital

786
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,860
will increase there's a hunger for power

787
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,020
and control and you're providing that

788
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,880
you're feeding that information to these

789
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,539
companies for their purposes I mean all

790
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,279
the social media platforms are proof of

791
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,299
that

792
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,740
um you've all heard that saying if it's

793
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,000
free you are the product

794
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,740
so what is my method of kind of

795
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,860
educating the Next Generation

796
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,320
my message here to you know my kids and

797
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,659
other people who don't take privacy

798
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,179
seriously is it's okay to be private you

799
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,860
know it's I'm not crazy I'm not paranoid

800
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,899
it's okay to be private and how do I

801
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,520
kind of um

802
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,799
demonstrate that so with my kids when I

803
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,240
take them out for ice cream through a

804
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,559
drive-through

805
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,059
um the drive-through asks what's your

806
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,700
name I usually give an alias name a fake

807
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,159
name just for fun and and I don't make

808
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,460
it like I can't pull off a John or a mic

809
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,080
or whatever but so I give it something

810
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,179
close to my own name I'll say maybe

811
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,700
close to my ethnicity I'll say Ali or

812
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,539
Akbar or Adam or Adam whatever and I say

813
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,039
that and my kids are listening to me

814
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,899
that's my purpose and they're being

815
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,960
educated and my my daughters ask me all

816
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,159
the time they're like but that's not

817
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,080
your name they immediately say I'm like

818
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,260
stay quiet I'm like okay and when I go

819
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,480
further they're like uh I tell them do

820
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,220
they really need to know my name do I

821
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,559
know this person they just needed to put

822
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,720
it on the box or whatever and they're

823
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,919
like yeah I'm like you know what they're

824
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,360
gonna do with my name and address and

825
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,440
stuff they're like what are they gonna

826
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,480
hack me so they're young they're under

827
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,860
10 so they don't know but they know what

828
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,600
hacking is right you don't want to be

829
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,100
hacked do you no no we don't want to be

830
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,020
hacked like okay good so the next time

831
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,059
we go around you know they play play

832
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,700
along so I went for this covert test the

833
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,559
other day and it's a drive through

834
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,899
covert test and I had the whole family

835
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,940
tested and in the drive-through there

836
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,740
they have this little QR code or

837
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,179
whatever you go on the website and you

838
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,679
fill out the information

839
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,659
so I asked my kids I'm like so who do

840
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:07,799
you want to be today

841
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,600
let's make a game out of this and and

842
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,120
they started you know giving me names I

843
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,380
want to be this or that I'm like cool

844
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,059
you're this today and you're that and

845
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,159
their date of births I changed uh so

846
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:18,779
their names are false the date of births

847
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,760
were incorrect very close to the real

848
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,080
ones because I still wanted the

849
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,940
statistical data for their purposes to

850
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,220
be whatever from a year perspective but

851
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,440
the month and day was different and then

852
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,080
the address obviously wasn't correct a

853
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,640
phone number was random because they

854
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,260
don't need this information I just want

855
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,080
to know if I'm positive or negative what

856
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,020
will all this other information do so I

857
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,840
I did all that the kids had fun and they

858
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,760
pretended to be someone else and they

859
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,059
they knew that it's okay to give out

860
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,760
Alias names it's okay not to give out

861
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,500
your personal information it's okay to

862
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,779
say no

863
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,399
So eventually what happened after I do

864
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,159
some of these games is I I saw my

865
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:02,220
daughter playing that silly game on our

866
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,419
iPad

867
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,659
what's it called uh Roblox

868
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:07,860
and I've heard a lot of stories about

869
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,799
Roblox that um

870
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:12,779
pedophiles are on the

871
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,360
programming team and it's uh there's a

872
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,100
lot of shady stuff that goes on there on

873
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,899
the chatting groups and stuff so I

874
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,059
didn't want her on that game but I

875
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,580
didn't say much I I sat an extra and

876
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,760
observed what she was doing and to my

877
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,500
surprise I saw a screen name I'm like

878
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,419
that's not your name who's who's that

879
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:32,340
and she's like oh that is my name that's

880
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,380
my screen name and it was a totally

881
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,299
different person's name and with some

882
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,159
numbers around it I was so proud of her

883
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,159
I'm like yes you used an alias name so

884
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,279
it worked so these techniques work so

885
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:47,340
apply them with the people around you I

886
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,080
do it with my wife all the time she has

887
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,240
packages delivered to the house with her

888
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,860
real name I'm like listen if you're

889
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,500
afraid to give out a fake name so so

890
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,240
practices that come to my house are

891
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,039
always in someone else's name you know

892
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,740
Tony Stark or John Doe or Brad Pitt or

893
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,600
whatever I just have fun with it but my

894
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,580
wife can't do the same she's kind of she

895
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,040
feels awkward or scared or whatever so I

896
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,540
say okay just misspell your name a

897
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,980
little bit because people searching when

898
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,080
I do when I do awesome I do exact

899
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,480
searches of names with quotes and stuff

900
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,820
so if somebody's misspelled their name I

901
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,339
probably won't catch it unless I know uh

902
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,560
to use uh you know variable names so

903
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,780
there's many ways you can misspell it so

904
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,460
then she does that so I'm like okay one

905
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,859
step towards um you know a more private

906
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,080
life so those are the techniques I

907
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,879
encourage you to play around with if

908
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,800
you're if you don't want to dive that

909
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,540
deep into it

910
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,219
another documentary you know you should

911
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,800
watch is the social dilemma and the gist

912
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,320
of it is you will learn eventually that

913
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,940
uh

914
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,099
all that information collection at the

915
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,020
end of the day undermines free thought

916
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,699
we talk about free speech freedom of

917
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,320
this freedom of that so what about

918
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,899
freedom of thought with all these ads

919
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,300
targeted ads bombarded to you

920
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,400
um you know I I see on YouTube when my

921
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,200
kids are watching I I get cyber security

922
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,839
ads I'm like how is my TV connected to

923
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,119
what I do on my laptop and and stuff it

924
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,099
is they just know and I've got such

925
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,079
targeted ads some of them are useful and

926
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,640
stuff but at the end of the day they

927
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,520
know so much about your habits so I have

928
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,920
a Alias Instagram account it's a funny

929
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,920
story uh it's so accurate on how they

930
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,720
know me none of my information is true

931
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,820
on that account but I get

932
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,420
um ads about beard oil apparently I have

933
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,500
a little bit of beard but I'm getting

934
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,900
ISO so they know I'm male at least I get

935
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,599
ads about security I'm like how do they

936
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,160
know are they going through my cash as

937
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,380
I've said I'm on a VPN I do so many

938
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,180
other things at the end of the day they

939
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,500
will find out their algorithms are

940
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,960
getting smarter and smarter so be

941
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,460
cognizant of that this is an entire

942
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,380
billion dollar industry they just want

943
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,780
your attention and at the end of the day

944
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,660
what bothers me is my mind's my mindset

945
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,540
is is changing because of stuff like

946
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,400
this they undermine free thought if I'm

947
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,280
Pro this Pro that they will give me more

948
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,560
content based on what I'm Pro versus

949
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,320
what I'm against so my bias is becoming

950
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,720
stronger and stronger instead of giving

951
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,720
me a wider scope of a thought process so

952
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,640
this is actually quite dangerous so I

953
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,400
encourage you watch this

954
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,040
and this is I would say the next Big

955
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,920
Field out there we talk a lot about

956
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,079
security and ocean and stuff but get

957
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,240
into privacy because there's actual jobs

958
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,820
around privacy there's stuff that I do

959
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,740
privacy Consulting

960
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,500
it's you know my area field is mostly

961
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,140
victim protection from stalkers and

962
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,520
stuff

963
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,220
um but it's also you know safeguarding

964
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,619
organizations their Trade Secrets the

965
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,780
intellectual property and stuff that

966
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,300
falls under you know the same thing cpos

967
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,540
and new uh role that's out there for a

968
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,240
few years now Chief privacy officer

969
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,940
and then there's reputation managers a

970
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,780
lot of the things I talked about

971
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,940
scrubbing your data having your

972
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,640
reputation uh cleaned up celebrities

973
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,920
often want that or politicians or anyone

974
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,900
for that matter that falls under the

975
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,540
category of SEO hacking so search engine

976
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,420
optimization hiking so one of the things

977
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,940
that you cannot kind of scrub from the

978
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,500
internet are government records so

979
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,720
anything on a gov website will stay

980
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,400
there pretty much forever so if you have

981
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,160
a criminal record that's public uh it

982
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,320
it's really hard to take that off you

983
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,599
need court orders and stuff so if you

984
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,240
can't take it off you do SEO hacking you

985
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,859
put in so much positive information

986
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,020
about yourself you create 50 accounts

987
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,240
blogs uh you know Alias accounts and

988
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,579
stuff so that page one of Google is now

989
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,380
all that stuff that you've put in and

990
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,359
then the negative stuff is on page two

991
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,599
or three which no one ever checks so

992
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,339
that's where you hide a dead body I've

993
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:47,579
heard page two

994
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,160
so just like we have uh what is it the

995
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,200
security in that or defense in-depth

996
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,540
concept we have the same concept in

997
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,760
privacy so have a layered approach in

998
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,839
privacy

999
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,500
that's how you kind of get to that level

1000
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,420
and you must set up a private

1001
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,940
infrastructure for everything you do so

1002
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,640
depending on what your threat is you

1003
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,619
know you must have all these things set

1004
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,820
up and a better visual of this is the

1005
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,339
next slide where it starts with data

1006
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:20,339
removal you start that process slowly

1007
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,500
and surely you have credit freezes to

1008
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,420
protect yourself from you know someone

1009
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,160
else having access to your social

1010
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,720
security number and opening Credit in

1011
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,119
your name then you have private

1012
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,920
infrastructure you know your car should

1013
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,660
be in an LLC your house should be in a

1014
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,339
trust or an LLC

1015
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,560
um all my utility bills five six of them

1016
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,540
none of them are in my name they're all

1017
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,859
part of some LLC or some trust for that

1018
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,500
matter so all these private databases

1019
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,420
that you pay for they actually take

1020
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,760
information from you know your your

1021
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,099
service provider or your electricity

1022
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,900
provider and stuff

1023
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,880
um so you don't want that information

1024
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,880
populating as well and then home privacy

1025
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,680
you know basic stuff about your home how

1026
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,119
to protect your home

1027
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,180
um you know blind Shades uh Google

1028
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,400
um street view so I took my house off of

1029
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,020
Google Street View because anyone can

1030
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,000
kind of see because I use that technique

1031
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,760
so again also in privacy go hand in hand

1032
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,079
um I always look at a person's house

1033
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,000
what it looks like you see yard signs

1034
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,740
you see their security system ADT

1035
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,079
protected by this or the political party

1036
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,880
affiliation is there or the sports team

1037
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,160
sign is on the window or something so I

1038
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,260
blurred out my stuff but then what

1039
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,420
people don't realize is there's Bing's

1040
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,040
version of street view as well you got

1041
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,140
to blur that out as well there's Apple's

1042
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,880
version of street view whatever they

1043
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,619
call it so there's at least three of

1044
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,420
those then there's a bunch of outs uh

1045
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,060
the crowdsourced versions of those so

1046
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,160
you have to do it thoroughly because of

1047
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,380
a person like me is searching for

1048
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,000
someone I'm not gonna stop at Google

1049
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,400
Street View so there's a lot of things

1050
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,320
so you need to create sort of like an

1051
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,599
infrastructure for privacy and then

1052
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,760
proactively alert I have Google alerts

1053
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,440
set and I have custom alerts at if my

1054
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,960
name pops up in Google and new entry I

1055
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,820
get an email so I can take action on it

1056
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,980
directly

1057
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,960
and finally I've created kind of

1058
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,480
a free tool a free website for everyone

1059
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,420
who everything I mentioned the whole

1060
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,160
infrastructure is on this operation

1061
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,440
privacy.com that's a website I created

1062
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,619
for the masses because I realized what I

1063
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:25,380
do for executives and high net worth

1064
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,660
clients most of the people in this

1065
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,940
planet cannot afford it the point one

1066
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,859
percent can afford what I do but what

1067
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,920
about the 99.9 this is for the rest of

1068
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,160
uh the people it's the same techniques I

1069
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,740
use if I were to scrub someone or put

1070
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,260
them on a privacy plan and you can use

1071
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,380
them as well it takes months to get on

1072
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,980
this but you can get nice tracking

1073
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,960
results how far are you along the

1074
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,119
Privacy Journey what's your privacy

1075
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,359
score and arbitrary number so this is

1076
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,000
quite useful to kind of manage your

1077
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,079
privacy presence

1078
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,740
and I have a lot of opt-out options in

1079
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,079
here so you can basically track when I

1080
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,500
opted out is it done uh does it apply to

1081
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,720
me or not and this way you know you

1082
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,400
won't be overwhelmed with the hundreds

1083
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,200
and hundreds of resources that are out

1084
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,880
there so it's a process

1085
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,680
um you know as people say it's a it's a

1086
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,780
marathon it's not a Sprint so take your

1087
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,480
time but at least be aware of the

1088
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,540
dangers and get on that Journey

1089
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,760
and eventually you need to demand

1090
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,619
control of this No One's Gonna Do It For

1091
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,960
You companies are gonna continue doing

1092
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,480
what they do so my message is you have

1093
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,339
to be in charge of your own data your

1094
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,800
own privacy

1095
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,380
and again as as closing thoughts I would

1096
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,099
say

1097
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:48,540
you know promote

1098
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,460
I won't say zero trust that's a buzzword

1099
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,400
and security another buzzword in privacy

1100
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,280
is zero knowledge so be careful with

1101
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,839
that so zero knowledge is basically any

1102
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,359
organization that does not keep any

1103
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,940
unnecessary information about you so I

1104
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,280
always say data that's that's not stored

1105
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,160
cannot be breached so just don't store

1106
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,140
any data anywhere

1107
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,000
um for companies at least and it's not

1108
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,500
going to be British so zero knowledge

1109
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,839
providers like you know proton VPN they

1110
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,200
don't store logs or mega.nz they destroy

1111
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,280
your data but they don't try anything

1112
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,619
else about you there's no logs of of

1113
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,900
when you log in what IP address you're

1114
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,700
at you know they store it for like 24

1115
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,740
hours for login purposes but after that

1116
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,900
they Purge it so if there's a law

1117
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,700
enforcement uh subpoena against it

1118
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,440
they're not going to find anything and

1119
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,140
there's actual proof of that so promote

1120
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,540
open source inquire about you know where

1121
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,400
do they get their money when I asked a

1122
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,660
lot of these vendors if they had some

1123
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,160
free tools I'm like okay you have this

1124
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,900
free tool how do you make money that's

1125
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,940
an important question to ask because if

1126
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,040
the answer is we don't what's your

1127
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,380
agenda what's your alter your objective

1128
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,339
here

1129
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:55,560
um so on my own website it was a free

1130
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,720
tool for everyone to use but then a lot

1131
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,740
of people convinced me they're like no

1132
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,060
you should put a donate button because

1133
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,740
people are going to question what you're

1134
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,660
doing with this data with this platform

1135
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,020
I didn't want to but I I had to so I put

1136
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,579
that in there so people are like you

1137
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,920
know okay we'll donate something but I

1138
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,359
told you I don't want anyone's money I

1139
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,579
just want to educate people and give

1140
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:16,920
them a platform but apparently you know

1141
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,200
you're supposed to know objectives of

1142
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,119
the company and question you know

1143
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,160
question everything and have better

1144
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,339
privacy practices and you know check out

1145
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:29,040
the website the dashboard if it's

1146
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,140
um it suits your needs it's a nice

1147
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,420
platform to get on to I also demoed

1148
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,920
another tool which is part of this

1149
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,660
platform which is a self-hosted

1150
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,420
Voiceover IP application

1151
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,640
um instead of relying on other providers

1152
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,260
with your data and stuff you can

1153
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,440
self-host it so check that out as well

1154
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,099
questions

1155
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,500
go ahead when you put that

1156
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,500
misinformation on the covet board is

1157
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,359
that not fraud no

1158
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,140
I'll just leave it to that the thing is

1159
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,420
that information was not being used for

1160
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,099
anything government purposes so it

1161
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,960
wasn't for my kids school it wasn't for

1162
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,000
travel it was for nothing they didn't

1163
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,300
know who I was what I was there for they

1164
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,500
were just going to email me results

1165
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,440
positive or negative so once I did give

1166
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,660
them sort of correct information like my

1167
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,520
real name at least because I needed it

1168
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,099
for my kids school and I had the real

1169
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,240
name but then they had everything else

1170
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,579
that was false so

1171
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:30,119
legal or not I don't care

1172
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,140
I'll say it I know I know uh some of the

1173
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,098
housing sites like

1174
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,200
like zero if you purchased it because

1175
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,880
you're okay you can kind of you can

1176
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,140
struggle with them do you know if any

1177
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,720
others like that there are quite a few

1178
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,000
yeah you you mentioned a few but um

1179
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,300
there's a whole list of sites similar to

1180
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,819
the housing and they keep growing so I

1181
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,500
don't want to name a few and then the

1182
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,560
the top ones are Redfin and Zillow and

1183
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,819
um there's there's a few more I have

1184
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:02,520
listed in my bookmarks but uh best thing

1185
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,480
is to Google search your home address

1186
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,119
and find out where these pictures of

1187
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,619
your home are you know previous pictures

1188
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,359
I've actually used this technique many

1189
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,099
times and awesome where there was a

1190
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:15,300
political candidate and they're like

1191
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,980
okay do ocean on me before my

1192
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,319
competitors do it and I found his home

1193
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:22,200
that was posted on Zillow and it had

1194
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,500
pictures of certain things on the wall

1195
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,020
and certain text his refrigerator had

1196
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,780
magnets on it with places of countries

1197
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,359
that said turkey and

1198
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,700
um Malaysia and stuff like that so I I

1199
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,079
asked them like so you've been to Turkey

1200
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,240
and you've been to Malaysia and uh you

1201
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,740
love Texas somehow you're not in Texas

1202
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,599
but you are the Texas uh whatever the

1203
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,640
the map and so how do you know all that

1204
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,900
information I was like it was on your

1205
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,579
fridge magnets like how do you have

1206
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,500
access to my house like I don't Zillow

1207
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,859
does so I advise them to log into Zillow

1208
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:55,079
claim that as your own uh account and

1209
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:56,339
house and just remove that information

1210
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,500
so at some point he put it up for sale

1211
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,119
but he didn't but those pictures were

1212
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,020
out there

1213
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,880
so yeah that's that's a good source of

1214
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,119
information

1215
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,260
resources I use are pretty targeted is

1216
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:23,720
there any kind of placent correlation

1217
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,480
yeah I often deal with people with a

1218
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,000
very common name in the U.S you know

1219
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,160
Mike's John Smith and stuff like that

1220
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,640
and they seem to be hard at first but

1221
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,380
once you know so I talked about seed

1222
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,480
information the more I have the better

1223
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,220
I'm at my job so if you just have a name

1224
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,020
and it's too common but then I ask for

1225
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,760
something else like a location and I

1226
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,140
kind of tie it down and then I know

1227
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,180
other information age group where they

1228
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,980
went to school or college then social

1229
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,900
media will kind of give me a better idea

1230
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,000
and then very quickly you kind of just

1231
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,460
hone into one person and now you know

1232
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,560
who your target is so it's not hard to

1233
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,000
do it just takes a little bit of

1234
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,140
thinking outside the box

1235
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,079
that question from online uh any top

1236
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,480
three use cases for VPN providers and

1237
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,579
then recommendations for VPN providers

1238
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,000
that fit those use cases yeah I mean I

1239
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,260
personally use

1240
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,579
um

1241
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,460
proton VPN

1242
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:22,859
I there's Pia that's also zero knowledge

1243
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:25,980
and then there's windscribe that's also

1244
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,619
a good zero knowledge provider

1245
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,420
um there's a few others there's probably

1246
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,359
five or six in that list that I would

1247
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,079
recommend as proper VPN providers legit

1248
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:39,300
who you know have a history you know

1249
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,640
their CEOs you know what they do they

1250
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,760
have a paid tier or a free tier but

1251
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,680
those are the vetted ones you should use

1252
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,619
everything else is kind of junk if if

1253
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,480
there's something fishy about a VPN

1254
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,280
provider if it's free and they have ads

1255
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,980
on it you know run away from those I

1256
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,839
think I heard previous presentations

1257
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,359
um where they said some VPN providers

1258
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:04,500
use are used as proxies so bright data

1259
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,319
is one that uses that so there's a lot

1260
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,540
that push ads and have proxies and they

1261
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,579
log your data don't use those it's not

1262
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:15,200
worth the privacy

1263
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,060
I have to so Pia got acquired by a

1264
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,060
company that was selling data and so far

1265
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,060
they're still legit their head uh the

1266
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,220
the company that acquired them was a

1267
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,599
little shady so now the recommendation

1268
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:39,660
is kind of moving away from CIA but

1269
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,579
again you can throw dirt on an

1270
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,020
organization just because they have

1271
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,060
affiliations with another parent company

1272
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,560
that bought it their policies still

1273
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,660
remain the same when law enforcement

1274
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,880
still does subpoenas against them they

1275
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,160
still don't find any data so the proof

1276
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,079
is in the pudding we've seen it in

1277
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,060
action that they still don't keep data

1278
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,119
but they have some advantages over

1279
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,460
others so it's good to have choice you

1280
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,200
know if you're already on a plan keep on

1281
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,000
that plan no need to like scramble

1282
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,680
around and and waste money here and

1283
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,900
there but there's still a legitimate

1284
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,180
provider I personally don't use them I

1285
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,460
stick with proton but it doesn't mean

1286
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,619
you don't you have to do the same

1287
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,960
like you're at the next question you're

1288
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,619
talking about um

1289
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,560
uh factual information about yourself

1290
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,260
being captured by data Brokers for

1291
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,160
example so uh have you gone after eight

1292
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,079
programs directly

1293
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,880
the question is have I gone after him

1294
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,400
so how do I recommend with dealing with

1295
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,020
data Brokers if I've gone after them

1296
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,540
they're in the industry of getting your

1297
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,599
data and they will not listen to you so

1298
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:51,900
a lot of the smaller data Brokers and by

1299
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,819
the way one data broker owns maybe 50

1300
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:55,680
companies with different names and stuff

1301
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,980
they're all part of a group they will

1302
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,660
have an opt-out process for legal

1303
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,819
reasons some of them will not comply

1304
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:05,819
some of them will so most of them in the

1305
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,980
opt out list that are published by

1306
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,960
Michael basil as well on Intel

1307
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,839
techniques they're all legit they have a

1308
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,700
process but then there's other data

1309
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,079
Brokers that just won't listen to you

1310
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,240
they don't have a process in place so

1311
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,220
don't rely on data Brokers to actually

1312
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,099
you know do their to to do their job

1313
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:25,140
because their job is collecting data and

1314
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,819
selling it for money and when you come

1315
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,319
in and say remove my data they don't

1316
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,200
like it so you will get resistance but I

1317
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,660
wouldn't rely on that alone right it's

1318
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,819
really endless as if today's society

1319
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:37,440
becoming like privacy is in this network

1320
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,240
because companies

1321
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,119
consumers as a product and they openly

1322
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:43,980
and freely share anything and everything

1323
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,900
that they've collect about you yeah and

1324
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,700
they sell it for a profit then they sell

1325
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,920
it to data they do and those data

1326
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,720
Brokers May remove your data today but

1327
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,059
then a few weeks down the line your

1328
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,800
information will repopulate because they

1329
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,839
got it from other sources so there's no

1330
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,480
guarantee so it's a constant process and

1331
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,400
once you're done with that's why there's

1332
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,380
a flow you have to follow before this

1333
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,960
information comes information removal so

1334
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,760
scraping yourself off the internet and

1335
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,099
getting off all your personal data out

1336
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:13,200
and then this information so that when

1337
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,000
they do get repopulated they don't get

1338
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,140
the right data about you

1339
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,400
email passwords that we're doing a

1340
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,140
bridgeless we're approaching out on it

1341
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,760
is an employee showing up on a breach

1342
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,200
list of the network of officers

1343
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,880
right and they'll tell you hey yeah we

1344
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,500
have a tool mentioned earlier

1345
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,119
to multiple more accounts

1346
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,040
as a question is to map a certain email

1347
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,660
address to multiple accounts where

1348
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,220
they're using it what they're not

1349
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,920
telling you employees so the source is

1350
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,099
usually public data like um have been

1351
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,020
pawn.com we'll show you a list of data

1352
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,700
breaches uh they won't show you

1353
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,559
passwords so you must have that data

1354
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,359
with you you have to download password

1355
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:08,760
breaches to get the passwords there then

1356
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,559
you can search based on passwords if the

1357
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,140
password is unique enough uh you know

1358
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,540
human password's not password manager

1359
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,660
generated passwords which is 99.9 of the

1360
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,700
time people do it with themselves so if

1361
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,559
it's Unique enough you can reverse

1362
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,540
search that entire breach database with

1363
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,339
just that unique password and then

1364
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:28,260
hopefully you'll find other places that

1365
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,000
they've used the same password or a

1366
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,680
version of the password with you know

1367
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,599
wildcard searching and stuff if that

1368
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,280
doesn't work you take a hash of that

1369
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,680
password an md5 hash or show one hash

1370
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,200
because some breaches don't have the

1371
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,540
password cracked yet or they destroyed

1372
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,280
in a certain hash so then if it's a

1373
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,260
weekend of hash search based on that if

1374
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,020
it's a strong hash like a big tests you

1375
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,059
can't because the hash changes every

1376
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:52,819
time you encrypt it

1377
00:52:52,819 --> 00:52:55,920
yes there are online tools do it

1378
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,700
dhash.com does it for you it's a paid

1379
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,380
service though so I don't promote it as

1380
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,540
much I just do it everything offline I

1381
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,040
just download all the beaches myself I

1382
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,839
don't rely on any other resources

1383
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:08,819
because tomorrow that site may not exist

1384
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,680
then my whole business model has gone to

1385
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,900
crap basically and today that site is

1386
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,700
free tomorrow it may not be so I tried

1387
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,780
not to rely on public websites for them

1388
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,579
another question

1389
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,940
so you said you used llc's a lot but the

1390
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,619
ownership of the llc's public

1391
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,960
information

1392
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,339
director or how do you get around that

1393
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,839
I'm glad somebody asked that question so

1394
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:32,940
the question was I use LLCs a lot and

1395
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,920
LLC shows information because a lot of

1396
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,280
the LLCs are public for the agent or the

1397
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,700
owner correct yeah so some of the times

1398
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,020
it doesn't matter

1399
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,440
but uh I don't use a little season that

1400
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,839
way so there's anonymized LLCs there are

1401
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,760
certain states that you can open llc's

1402
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,440
in that don't share the data publicly

1403
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,980
there's very few in New Mexico LLC is a

1404
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,599
popular example but there are other

1405
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,819
states as well you can nominate someone

1406
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:03,420
else like an agent a legal a law office

1407
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,540
so no one you know but hire a lawyer to

1408
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,700
do it for you they'll charge 99 to

1409
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,859
create an LLC for you their name will be

1410
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:12,960
on it all the other articles of

1411
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,579
organization will be private it will be

1412
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:16,020
only between you and the lawyer so

1413
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,880
that's one way but I've gone away from

1414
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,380
llc's because it's still public

1415
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,980
government data I switched to trusts

1416
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,480
more because the trust is a document

1417
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,119
that is not submitted anywhere it's just

1418
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,920
a name you can have any random name and

1419
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,660
the actual trust document stays with you

1420
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,119
at home at all times so it's it's not

1421
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,400
stored anywhere online so I've switched

1422
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,079
to that method there's home trust

1423
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:38,880
there's business trust there's a

1424
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,740
revocable living process so many types

1425
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,900
of trust it's a whole different you know

1426
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,760
game there

1427
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,540
foreign

1428
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,599
privacy

1429
00:54:56,579 --> 00:55:01,460
uh secure browsing along with VPN is uh

1430
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,920
ideas back uh if you're going to use

1431
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,220
torque use EPN and then log in control

1432
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,559
yeah for Tor correct that's a minimum

1433
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,119
requirement for me at least because the

1434
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:14,099
ISP knows what you're doing so there

1435
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:15,839
your use cases you want to hide your

1436
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,880
traffic from the ISP not from data

1437
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,020
Brokers or anything else but I don't

1438
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,059
want the ISP knowing where that I've

1439
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,800
opened up a Tor Browser because it has

1440
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,720
unique traffic so yes first be on a VPN

1441
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,240
now the ISP is blinded by everything and

1442
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,859
anything that you do I'll do whatever

1443
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:31,319
you want so vpns a lot of people are

1444
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:32,760
against VPN so like no my traffic's

1445
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,680
already encrypted the https and stuff

1446
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,900
yeah but the DNS is not encrypted or

1447
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,940
even if you have DNS SEC there's so much

1448
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,859
other traffic and anomalies and and

1449
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:43,559
heuristics that can kind of uh deep back

1450
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,079
an inspection can decipher it so yeah

1451
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,660
good advice

1452
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,260
all right are we up on time or

1453
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,660
almost yeah

1454
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,520
about out of time here anyone one last

1455
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,119
question anybody

1456
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,200
officially it's Michelle

1457
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,740
[Music]

1458
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,579
all right well thank you very much

1459
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:10,080
Michelle for the talk that was great

1460
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,330
[Applause]
