1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,400
so I would I'm uh pleased to present

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,139
actually I am very interested in this

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,019
talk uh Caitlin Eubanks whose

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,179
information security architect for the

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,880
city of Sioux Falls and you can explain

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,340
why you got drafted to give this talk

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,460
but this is this follows on to the last

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,000
talk and I'm concerned about it because

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,820
I work for the government and I'm not

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,560
even here to help you

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,500
so Caitlyn

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,140
thank you thank you yes I'm here to talk

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,239
about communication and security how to

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,399
gain understanding and Rapport and a

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,100
seemingly perplexing field so that might

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,079
be kind of funny seeing how we have such

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,719
a short and obvious presentation on how

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,000
to simplify communication when it comes

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,039
to your infrastructure but we'll go

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,719
ahead and give it a try shall we so

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,680
again

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,020
um see here

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,180
you know who I am so first I want to

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,680
give a little introduction about the

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,619
city of Sioux Falls so Sioux Falls South

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,619
Dakota we have about 200 000 residents

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,119
that live within our city our department

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,000
contains about 12 different departments

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,500
so fire libraries police public parking

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,180
we have obviously the technology

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,400
department we have

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,920
gosh Water Reclamation we have skate

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,460
environments and with that we have about

34
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,619
1500 employees that the technology

35
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,680
department needs to help and manage so

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,900
with that a variety of different

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,600
departments we have hundreds and

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,820
hundreds of software applications that

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,619
we have to take care of right so this

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,420
Probably sounds familiar to lots of

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,880
different environments nothing new

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
obviously there are multiple needs per

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,899
Department as far as technology is

44
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,820
concerned I mean if you think about all

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,619
the way from the library serving public

46
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,899
with you know checking out books you

47
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,659
know story times to our police and fire

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,420
that are 24 7 to our scada environments

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,640
that provide City Water city electricity

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,699
okay so like I said quite a wide variety

51
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,979
that we need to protect in our little

52
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,900
infrastructure we have about 2 000

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,400
endpoint devices

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
that's about 1700 endpoints laptops

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,440
desktops things like that and we

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,580
actually have 450 servers not 350. uh we

57
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,140
recently just increased our security

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,540
team so it's not just me we now have two

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,239
people so that's just awesome we also

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,099
have a Security administrator that helps

61
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,080
uh do all the security things that we

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,420
need to do so this is my little team

63
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,580
this is uh obviously you can tell right

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,560
in the middle of the covet era we all

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,780
had to wear a mask but uh hopefully you

66
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,660
get it it says uh we RIT

67
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,060
we've grown since then we have about 28

68
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,400
people on our team so a lot of these

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
faces are no longer with us but you get

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,700
the point we're a pretty cool team

71
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,480
pretty close right

72
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,180
so as a security architect and spreading

73
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,280
communication and security what are the

74
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,739
most common questions that I'm asked you

75
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,959
know on a daily basis right one of my

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
favorite ones is are we protected from

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,940
ransomware so if anyone knows how to

78
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,920
answer that question please let me know

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,200
it's a hard one and the reason for that

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,180
is because we have so many layers in

81
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,400
security right so how do you answer to

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
someone who has no idea what security is

83
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,360
how are we protected from ransomware

84
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,739
okay so generally I say sure okay why is

85
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,900
our endpoint protection so invasive

86
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,819
right we all have moved past the days of

87
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,920
ESET hopefully and you've gone into

88
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,480
these next Generation endpoint

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,280
Protection Systems you know ones that

90
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,959
deal with ransomware protection you know

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,480
malware you know Cloud analysis things

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,860
like that

93
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,440
and our end users love it they love

94
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,239
waiting for their items to be downloaded

95
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,340
from their emails they love the username

96
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,799
and password field scanned right no no

97
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,900
one likes that so I get the question a

98
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,299
lot can you just whitelist it right on

99
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,620
the endpoint like why do you have to

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,420
scan every download every field that we

101
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,400
do so that's always one of my favorite

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,860
ones for the network is out there can we

103
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,659
just open up the whole slash 24 or

104
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,760
subnet on the firewall for a vendor and

105
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,099
just let them in

106
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,980
we've all heard that one too right next

107
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,440
why do we have security awareness

108
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,100
training I don't even use a computer now

109
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,699
that's ironic right there there we go

110
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,440
why do we have to do security awareness

111
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,820
training I don't even use the internet

112
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,440
that's one of my favorite ones so we do

113
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,479
have a street department love them they

114
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,040
do take care of the snow and ice on our

115
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,080
roads again South Dakota it's pretty

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,160
snowy

117
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,900
um and so we always have to sell our

118
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,240
security awareness training platform can

119
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,460
we stop making password complexity a

120
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,020
requirement I'm sure everyone remembers

121
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,460
about two years ago they put out some

122
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,080
articles that said

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,000
um you don't need passwords anymore in

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,380
fact if you just have multi-factor

125
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,320
authentication we don't need passwords I

126
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,540
did attend a speech earlier today or a

127
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,759
presentation on passwordless security so

128
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,040
that was interesting but it takes a lot

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,460
of effort to get there right

130
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,620
why do security applications cost so

131
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,540
much anyone make that walk of shame down

132
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,280
to finance and ask for half a million

133
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,500
dollars for the next manage defense

134
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,940
solution you want to purchase or

135
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,639
anything similar yeah we always have to

136
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,780
decide

137
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,560
how to balance you know cost and benefit

138
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,419
return on investment of applications

139
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,820
right and then my favorite that I always

140
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,660
get is what do you do are you the uh no

141
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,479
before person do you send me phishing

142
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,800
emails monthly because I don't

143
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
appreciate that I've also been called in

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,280
internal terrorist that goes with I.T so

145
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,719
security it's fun

146
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,940
along with that with communication you

147
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,340
have to consider all the stakeholders in

148
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,080
your environment right you have to

149
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,520
consider your audience when you're

150
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,380
trying to spread your word and your

151
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,300
awareness and what you can provide with

152
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,460
the benefits that you get from the

153
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,680
applications that you purchase okay so

154
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,479
the first ones that you need to talk to

155
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,820
are your executive teams right they're

156
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,680
the ones at the very top who have no

157
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,060
idea what you're talking about when you

158
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,400
say firewall or endpoint protection but

159
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,580
they know you're expensive and is it

160
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,259
really worth it right we have cyber

161
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,820
Insurance why do we need all of this

162
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,680
right we get ransomware we'll just pay

163
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,020
it you know things like that next we

164
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,300
have our directors and managers they

165
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,740
know a little bit more about what you're

166
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,940
talking about and they're usually the

167
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,220
ones telling you to slow down take a

168
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,900
breath look at the infrastructure

169
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,759
because everyone needs money right it's

170
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,620
not just security okay

171
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,720
next you have the employees with little

172
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,400
I.T knowledge I kind of spoke on this

173
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,319
before the guys who never log in right

174
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,539
the guys who hardly ever get on the

175
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:40,919
computers and now you're asking them to

176
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,539
use multi-factor authentication and

177
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:43,860
they're going

178
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,199
why why are you making this so difficult

179
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,180
I just won't I won't log in anymore I

180
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,699
won't check my email anymore right uh

181
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,919
employees who are technology experts

182
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,620
these are my favorite I love these in

183
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,120
fact we empowered them in our

184
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,500
organization and we picked one per

185
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,479
department and we said you're obviously

186
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,860
good with computers guess what your job

187
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,720
is to Train everybody else to be good on

188
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,380
computers so ha joke's on you and then

189
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,539
the hardest seller you're going to have

190
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,360
is your own it Department

191
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,199
oh they're a tough sell for sure so

192
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,880
I'm going to go into a little story time

193
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,280
so I've worked for the city now for

194
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,460
about four and a half almost five years

195
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,860
when I first started about four months

196
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,280
in we changed our endpoint protection so

197
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,720
like I mentioned earlier the little

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,580
check box right the one that just does

199
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,979
what it does and it's good for you know

200
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,380
like I said check in the box okay we

201
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,120
went to one of these next generation

202
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,419
super endpoint protections you know it

203
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,759
does everything malware analysis you

204
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,740
know zero day protection you know all

205
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,840
this stuff and whatnot well what we

206
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,160
didn't consider is what it was going to

207
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
do to our end users in fact we rolled

208
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
out this security platform uh with

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,020
endpoint protection

210
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,180
literally in about probably three months

211
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,160
didn't do any educational Awareness on

212
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,740
it didn't do any kind of training or

213
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,020
anything with our staff and guess what

214
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,199
they hated it and I heard about it every

215
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,680
single day how slow it was to get your

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,479
applique you know to get your documents

217
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,800
that you're downloading from your email

218
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,740
how awful it was that it was scanning

219
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,240
you know websites that you were trying

220
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,940
to go to how it was blocking people from

221
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,620
attempting to download malicious things

222
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,500
I mean it was terrible it was terrible

223
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,180
and like I said that was about four

224
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,919
months in so it kind of gives you a

225
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,360
little bit of a feeling that this is

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,219
going to be rough this is I'm a failure

227
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,679
like they already hate me right

228
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,039
and so it really took some time to step

229
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,799
back after that and and learn a couple

230
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,660
lessons Okay and I think this is

231
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,640
important and like I said none of this

232
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,440
that I'm giving you today should be

233
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,060
anything new right this should just be

234
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,560
something that always sticks in the back

235
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,680
of your mind no matter what you're doing

236
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,440
if it impacts all of the users in your

237
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,839
organization you need awareness and

238
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,580
training when deploying out new software

239
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,580
it is what it is I know we're not always

240
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,740
the outgoing personalities and we like

241
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,420
to hide in the you know the server room

242
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,040
with the Blinky lights and not really

243
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,660
before front when people see security

244
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,480
coming down the hallway they go oh crap

245
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,019
but we need to train our end users on

246
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,660
the technology we expect them to use for

247
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,600
it to be successful okay you also need

248
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,640
to make sure you have the support of all

249
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,839
the leaders in your organization

250
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,420
starting from top to bottom and you will

251
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,100
get challenges and you will get leaders

252
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,480
that don't agree with you but if you can

253
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,100
get the majority on your side and

254
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,660
understand what advancements you're

255
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,620
trying to make for an infrastructure

256
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,500
structure the benefit is all for you

257
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,440
then using your favor okay and end users

258
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,540
need to understand why the changes are

259
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,540
necessary not just how to use the new

260
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,480
software technology but why they need to

261
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,820
use it right you know you're protecting

262
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,399
your downloads from ransomware right

263
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,140
everyone knows you know in the last

264
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,660
couple years ransomware has exploded

265
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,839
right and not just ransomware malware

266
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,120
we have all kinds of you know things

267
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,040
going on crazy in technology right now

268
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,920
but they need to know why is it scanning

269
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,560
my downloads why does it scan this why

270
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,200
is it so slow why are these protections

271
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,360
necessary and then make it relatable

272
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,160
right if you roll out a software and a

273
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,720
person goes home and they never even

274
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,399
talk about it again then is it really

275
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,040
benefiting them after work as well I

276
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,120
don't know

277
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,680
now Story Time 2.0 much happier much

278
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,779
more successful this is the time I

279
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,640
deployed a security awareness training

280
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,920
platform out to all of my users and

281
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,220
generally they tended to love it we did

282
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,399
a what should I call it a tour around

283
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,320
the city I went to every single

284
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,820
Department I met with all of their

285
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,860
managers and all of their leadership and

286
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,260
I said we are doing this for the benefit

287
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,420
of not only the city and protecting city

288
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,459
data and City assets but we're doing it

289
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,959
for our employees as well to educate

290
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,220
them on the threats that are out there

291
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,579
with cyber security okay and you can't

292
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,440
argue that I mean this isn't something

293
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,540
that users can go home and say well that

294
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,940
was a waste of time I spent an hour you

295
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,920
know of my day in this security training

296
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,420
and I didn't learn anything from it

297
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,480
right you have to sell it to them and I

298
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,320
I went so far as to buy cups I went so

299
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,959
far as to buy like just all kinds of

300
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,760
funny stuff I think I got like color

301
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,680
changing cups you know people love color

302
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,600
changing cups believe it or not

303
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
I got like first aid kits for security I

304
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,380
thought that was clever apparently it

305
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,720
just flew over everybody's head but

306
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,820
generally uh it's been going really well

307
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,279
people know no before and I'm not afraid

308
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,019
to say that's the platform we use it's

309
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,440
probably the majority of what people use

310
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,480
we've been able to take our fish prone

311
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,600
rate from 22 down to one percent and I

312
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,980
just think that's great

313
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,600
um I get a lot of I'm not even checking

314
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,700
my email anymore and I go good that was

315
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,720
easy check that box right so like I said

316
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
going around getting your face out there

317
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,640
meeting the people you're trying to help

318
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,399
every day is the best thing you can do

319
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,760
for your infrastructure right so now

320
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,320
we're going to talk about each team here

321
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,140
getting buy-in with management and they

322
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,660
are tough uh security is a Hot Topic

323
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,579
right now so use that to your advantage

324
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,560
right it's practically in the media

325
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,360
every day you see something about

326
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,459
security you see something about cities

327
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,800
getting ransomware I keep those articles

328
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
in a little folder and every day I send

329
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,940
them to my boss just so they know

330
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,339
security is still important share the

331
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,540
facts the cost of becoming a victim is

332
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,120
crazy crazy expensive nowadays right I

333
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,279
mean it went from what like seventeen

334
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,380
thousand dollars to now we're in what 4

335
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,079
41 million dollars was the all-time high

336
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,600
for ransomware paying right

337
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,700
current trends you're seeing in your

338
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,040
environment just the other week we

339
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,760
watched a crazy increase in phishing

340
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,740
emails come through that had quack

341
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,139
bought malware in it and that's

342
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,579
something you need to report so that

343
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:06,959
your leadership knows like hey this is

344
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,019
real this is like on our doorstep right

345
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,760
what will be the benefit to the company

346
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
right you need that return on investment

347
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,200
I mean a lot of our managers like Focus

348
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,240
completely on the financial aspect

349
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,760
because they see you know this is going

350
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,320
to cost a hundred thousand dollars and

351
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
it does what you know

352
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,700
do not be a security know-it-all and

353
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,440
that one is so hard

354
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,240
um in the presentation I watched earlier

355
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,180
someone was talking about all the you

356
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,019
know

357
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,480
you know words that we have that not a

358
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,040
lot of people understand when we start

359
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,899
going into a deep conversation about

360
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,720
security so make sure you make it simple

361
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,820
and easy to understand

362
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,940
draw pictures that is not to say that

363
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,380
you're they're not intelligent they're

364
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,300
just not intelligent in security and you

365
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,240
need to help them be that way right and

366
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
don't make it difficult and have those

367
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,019
leaders take the information back to

368
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,459
their teams this goes with my know

369
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,079
before project my security awareness

370
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,420
training we rolled out I met with all

371
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,040
the managers and they rolled it out to

372
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,740
their teams the importance of it if you

373
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,240
don't have the support then why would

374
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,880
their teams have your support you know

375
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,980
next is getting buy-in with your

376
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,839
employees who are even more fun than the

377
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,660
managers again make it relatable

378
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,880
security awareness does not have to end

379
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,440
in the office

380
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,120
in fact one of the most difficult

381
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,860
co-workers I had to work with in this

382
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,380
city always questioned why he had to

383
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,279
take an hour out of his day once a year

384
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,440
to take security awareness training why

385
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,420
did we keep sending phishing emails that

386
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,820
seem to be targeted just at his email

387
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,800
address right

388
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,500
and then he calls me one day and he goes

389
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,040
I'm getting thousands and thousands of

390
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,579
emails in my inbox can you turn off my

391
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,040
email and I laughed and I said no we're

392
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,540
not going to turn off your email but

393
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,000
what you need to do is we need to look

394
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,860
through those emails because everyone

395
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,779
has heard of an email flood attack right

396
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,279
you get thousands and thousands of

397
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,899
emails different languages coming

398
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,060
through and then there's that one or two

399
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,220
emails in there that's from Wells Fargo

400
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,139
and it says your bank account

401
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,779
information has been changed and your

402
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,120
transfer is going to be happening in

403
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,199
three days

404
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,660
and if we had just shut off his email

405
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,519
and deleted all of those we would have

406
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,920
never known that this happened and this

407
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
isn't work related this is his personal

408
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,420
Wells Fargo account you know and so I

409
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,339
remember we helped him change his

410
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,079
password we turned multi-factor

411
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,220
authentication on and he said if only I

412
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,620
had paid attention maybe a little bit to

413
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,079
that security awareness training then

414
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:40,920
maybe I would have turned on

415
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,060
multi-factor and this wouldn't have

416
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,540
happened right so we turned it on and he

417
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,820
is like the first person to take the

418
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,920
training now and he tells his co-workers

419
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,079
the story too because it happened to him

420
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,120
like I said it wasn't work related but

421
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,800
you take that extra step and you win

422
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,300
that one person over and next thing you

423
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,680
know you have the whole team on your

424
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,760
side

425
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,100
so again make sure you showcase the

426
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,959
benefits of the change

427
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,459
okay

428
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,920
reassure the fact that security is not a

429
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,800
punishment and I think I get the most

430
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,720
arguments from this line here and the

431
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,339
reason for that is we did a lot of

432
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,360
research before doing security

433
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,579
educational awareness in our environment

434
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,040
and a lot of people said

435
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,440
we give three strikes in your fire

436
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,360
and I said well

437
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,240
that's crazy to me anyways I don't want

438
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,279
to punish people for taking security

439
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,500
awareness training I want to reward them

440
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,740
for giving training or taking it right I

441
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,120
want to offer classes throughout the

442
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,800
year and I want people to say I have

443
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,180
half an hour I'll take that training

444
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,620
course you know

445
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,420
I'll even give him a cup that color

446
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,639
changes if they'll take it so how can

447
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,759
you make it a game I I always gamify my

448
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,620
uh security awareness training or

449
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,959
anything for that matter you know

450
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,060
we give away all kinds of things it's

451
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,920
pretty fun and my employees have a lot

452
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,600
of buy-in from it and they tend to like

453
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,759
it I don't get a lot of like I don't

454
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,259
have to go to HR and say this person

455
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,699
didn't complete their training you

456
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,400
should fire them I just feel like that

457
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,799
would be awful and if you deal with a

458
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,020
company that has sensitive data like

459
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,240
Financial transactions like a bank and

460
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
that's what you guys decide to do no

461
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
hate from me that's your perspective

462
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,819
I've gotten the best results by being

463
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,740
positive with my team because that way

464
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,359
when they come to argue with me and I'm

465
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,520
like Hi how are you I'm so glad you're

466
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,319
enjoying the training they kind of turn

467
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,359
around and they just smile and say yeah

468
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,040
it's so much fun I wish I could do it

469
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,179
again

470
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,700
so anyways I have a lot of fun making

471
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,100
sure security is not a punishment

472
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,080
make sure to change it up you know how

473
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,880
to get the most interest from these team

474
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
members

475
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,100
um if you have the same training every

476
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,840
year uh then you'll start getting

477
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,940
complaints we do a lot of polling to see

478
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,559
if we can mix it up

479
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,780
and like I said punishing your end users

480
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,120
will not gain their trust or interest

481
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,520
that's all

482
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,220
next is work closely with your end users

483
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,039
don't be a security hermit and I kind of

484
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,539
mentioned on this a little bit earlier

485
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,179
but you need to listen to their needs an

486
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,700
example of this is it snows in South

487
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,620
Dakota as I mentioned before sometimes

488
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,840
quite a lot and I'm from Phoenix so any

489
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,720
kind of snow is like a lot and the

490
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,340
street department if we have our

491
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,660
training at the end of the year they're

492
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,520
kind of busy guess what

493
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,940
moving snow can they take an hour out of

494
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,280
their schedule to do security awareness

495
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,020
training no because you know they are

496
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,360
out on the road for up to 13 hours a day

497
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,260
moving snow so that's their priority so

498
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,600
we say that's totally fine we can make

499
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,400
that work I'll move your training a

500
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,260
couple months and your department will

501
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,299
just complete it a little bit later

502
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,760
and we'll all be happy and you'll still

503
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,080
take your security awareness training at

504
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,660
just at a later date so be willing to

505
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,760
make those changes I mean obviously I'm

506
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,700
not saying don't take the training you

507
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,020
still have to take it it's still

508
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,360
mandatory but just let's make it so it

509
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,980
works in your schedule and your

510
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,780
environment right

511
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,320
and try to balance the best you can your

512
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,539
impact on users and security best

513
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,120
practices obviously if I could cut the

514
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,980
cord to the Internet Security would be

515
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,600
super easy and I'm sure every security

516
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,640
person makes that joke everywhere we go

517
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,440
oh we'll just cut the internet it'll be

518
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,020
great it's impossible I've tried you get

519
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,880
yelled at a lot for hiding out in the

520
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,600
data center but what you can do

521
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,760
is like I mentioned

522
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,280
think about your users who are sitting

523
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,740
in the finance department okay they're

524
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,700
not

525
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,799
worried about security all the time like

526
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,179
you are like you're a crazy person right

527
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,380
you're always like oh my God we're gonna

528
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,480
get hacked when you know we need to make

529
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,980
sure multi-factor's on there we need to

530
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,419
make sure we have managed defense we

531
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,160
need to xyzing I need millions of

532
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,960
dollars to make sure we're secure and

533
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,460
our users are sitting there calculating

534
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,260
invoices you know where they're paying

535
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,419
bills that are due and with that they're

536
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,740
not thinking

537
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,880
all the time that oh gosh maybe I should

538
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,919
check on this vendor right and you want

539
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,780
them to think that but maybe they don't

540
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,480
right and so you have to think about I

541
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,620
can

542
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,160
a team do their job with the security

543
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,100
tools you're asking them to work with

544
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,900
okay so I guess that's the best way to

545
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,179
say that multi-factor authentication 100

546
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,900
yes in fact insurance and if anyone's

547
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,340
played with cyber security insurance

548
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,140
recently you know it's kind of throwing

549
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,340
your hand in the bucket at what you're

550
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,380
going to get back out

551
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,660
well he had to roll out multi-factor

552
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,520
authentication in a month

553
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,020
um yes I know you guys are like you're

554
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,059
crazy you didn't have multi-factor we

555
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,100
did in certain aspects but we didn't

556
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,820
have multi-factor Citywide

557
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,200
and you know the insurance was like well

558
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,580
you don't need it like city-wide I mean

559
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,799
we do now but back back then they said

560
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,660
no you just need it for privileged

561
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,120
accounts and and VPN connections which

562
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,360
we already did and things like that but

563
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,120
we had to think about okay these Street

564
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,480
teams that don't have a city cell phone

565
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,340
that aren't going to carry a key fob

566
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,320
because they'll probably lose it not

567
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,179
that they're tend to lose things but you

568
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,100
know what I'm saying how do we allow

569
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,559
them to use these tools to be secure

570
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,600
okay so you always have to think about

571
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,100
the person that's on the other side when

572
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,020
you're rolling these out and how can you

573
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,760
help them right so like I said our

574
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,679
endpoint protection is like super cool

575
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,539
and you know it scans all these

576
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,700
downloads and things that happen and I

577
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,860
get a lot of emails that are like hey I

578
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,280
scan or I my favorite was like I scan no

579
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,760
I download Verizon bills and if you've

580
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,220
ever printed out a Verizon bill just for

581
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,659
yourself you already know it's like 10

582
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:34,140
pages okay well imagine 1500 people okay

583
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,640
well probably not that many probably

584
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,740
like 600 people in the city have Verizon

585
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,960
phones so you can imagine this packet

586
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,360
that comes flying out of the downloads

587
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,480
and she says can you please turn off the

588
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,120
scanning for this download

589
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,020
I would not like to right but I have to

590
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,220
think

591
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,919
is this impacting her work is this

592
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
taking too long for it to download to

593
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,400
where she's not going to be able to

594
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,860
complete her job and if the answer is

595
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,539
yes then maybe you need to have a

596
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,039
conversation about how to make it easier

597
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,260
for her and I'm not saying make your

598
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,720
security more lenient right but

599
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,400
sometimes you have to consider the

600
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,320
benefits versus the cost

601
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,120
okay

602
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,880
and of course the most difficult group

603
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,679
that you'll have to work with is your

604
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,740
own I.T Department Okay the reason for

605
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,960
this is building the first line of

606
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,900
response right so any fun application

607
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,280
that you're like this is going to be

608
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
great it's going to be so secure guess

609
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,120
who's going to get the phone calls about

610
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,460
it probably your service desk your help

611
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,320
desk folks right if they don't

612
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,120
understand the tool that you're trying

613
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,679
to roll out and the benefits that it's

614
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,960
going to provide then you're gonna hear

615
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,380
about it trust me we've been there

616
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,500
again show how you're benefiting the

617
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,659
team long term

618
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,900
I try to do this by letting them in on

619
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,179
the conversation saying we really need

620
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,840
to move to a new protection platform and

621
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,700
I want your input on what you think is

622
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,440
challenging for you from the old

623
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,080
platform what can improve your workflow

624
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,200
and make this a lot easier for you right

625
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,600
and then my favorite is Gen demonstrate

626
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,299
the products full functionality help

627
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,940
them and train them give them the tools

628
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,760
to service the end users okay we rolled

629
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,340
out multi-factor authentication I wrote

630
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,740
an entire guide on how to use it and

631
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,360
that may seem like Overkill because yes

632
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,580
there's videos that they provide that

633
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,380
you can watch right but it's more

634
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,419
relatable when it comes from you in your

635
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:34,679
infrastructure and you can show them

636
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,659
pictures and how to walk through and

637
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,220
that way when they have questions you

638
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,419
can go it's on page three okay Empower

639
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,600
them okay they're not beneath you as we

640
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,640
all sometimes like to think in a pyramid

641
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,919
and I'm tier three or whatever they are

642
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,020
on the same team as you okay in fact

643
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,640
they're probably more helpful than you

644
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,260
are when it comes to and we're not all

645
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,860
Educators obviously okay I didn't just

646
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,840
go into security thinking God I would

647
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,820
love to train people on how to use no

648
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,980
before and multi-factor authentication

649
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,140
right but I think it takes a certain

650
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,179
person to go through an environment and

651
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,340
share that knowledge and I think that

652
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,080
really creates a very successful

653
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,640
security platform for you and your

654
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,039
organization like I mentioned ask for

655
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,440
their input make sure you are not

656
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,020
stepping on installation toes oh that's

657
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,200
a tough one okay so this is going to

658
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,320
sound crazy but we didn't have time set

659
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,980
aside to do any kind of application

660
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,100
upgrades or any of that we just kind of

661
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,440
did it and now we now we definitely have

662
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,480
a process for installations and upgrades

663
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,340
and things that we do but at the time

664
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,620
when we deployed some of our technology

665
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,299
out

666
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,760
yeah it would step on some insulation

667
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,159
toes and then we would have Windows

668
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,480
updates going on at the same time

669
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,159
endpoint protection updates were going

670
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,900
on and then phone upgrades were going on

671
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,100
and then guess what didn't work

672
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,700
everything so always speak with your

673
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,520
team and have a plan of attack right

674
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,640
create a beautiful timeline of events

675
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,980
that you want to happen make sure years

676
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,480
in advance I'm just kidding make sure

677
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,520
like weeks in advance that they know the

678
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,740
dates ahead of time every Monday meeting

679
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,020
you go we're still doing that yes we're

680
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,539
we're still gonna do that and during

681
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,400
that time make sure you keep your date

682
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,559
you know in the back of their minds okay

683
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,120
a lot of people tend to forget about

684
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,980
security applications and them rolling

685
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,720
out and doing the upgrades and stuff but

686
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,880
they still exist and we still need to do

687
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,100
things with them and of course be

688
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,779
willing to do the work you're asking of

689
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,880
your team like I said writing how-to

690
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,799
guides help Gathering data for

691
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,720
installation

692
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,360
it's it's true if I wasn't there on the

693
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,039
field of these guys doing the work that

694
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,059
they're doing

695
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,340
I probably wouldn't even understand the

696
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,960
scope of my application and its impact

697
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,179
either right

698
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,620
then point protection I was talking

699
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,659
about earlier even though I feel

700
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,760
personally like that was a failed

701
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,340
project a lot of people now look back

702
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,220
and see that it was a benefit but I went

703
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,799
to almost every single Department that

704
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,960
my technicians didn't understand and we

705
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,179
installed it for them and showed them

706
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,400
how to use it and they're a lot more

707
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,900
comfortable with it now and I think they

708
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,940
see a lot more of the positives of this

709
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,159
endpoint than they do the negatives and

710
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,260
that took a long time

711
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,480
I would say

712
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,820
gosh it's been probably two years and

713
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,440
that just sounds crazy

714
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,900
but they're finally saying okay this

715
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,820
isn't as bad as we thought it was you

716
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,679
know thanks or whatever for bringing it

717
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,419
into the environment

718
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,100
and I really get emails about it anymore

719
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,900
where when we've deployed that endpoint

720
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,880
I tell you what we got them about every

721
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,779
day so how to defeat the Blank Stare

722
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,940
this is my favorite this is for all the

723
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,860
groups that you deal with right we've

724
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,419
seen it the look that you've lost your

725
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,220
audience I kind of mentioned on this a

726
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,720
little bit earlier

727
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,440
when you start using security lingo

728
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,419
you'll lose your audience because we

729
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,679
don't they don't live in that world and

730
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,240
I I know I touched on this but I'm going

731
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,919
to talk on a little bit more uh you

732
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,020
start talking about what a Sim is okay

733
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,000
you start talking about white hats black

734
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
hats purple hats Red Hat whatever right

735
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,440
blue teams red teams you're talking

736
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,940
about denial of service you talk about

737
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,679
how you really want Canary Honeypot

738
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,299
tokens in your environment and it just

739
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,500
goes okay I've seen it you get so

740
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,059
excited and passionate you're like this

741
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,620
technology is so cool you know what it's

742
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,299
going to benefit us and everyone's like

743
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,520
yeah cool that sounds expensive yeah

744
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,960
that's really awesome

745
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,120
so you have to start the conversation

746
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,919
with relatable examples when you have

747
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,900
these meetings right you need to say

748
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,000
exactly what they are you know make make

749
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,919
simple terms like I say here a Honeypot

750
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,039
tricks bad guys in your environment that

751
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,559
sounds cool right a denial of service

752
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,600
will interrupt the network and cost

753
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,880
possibly millions of dollars right

754
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,059
that's a good way to go about it right

755
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:54,840
apt is bad malware bad people right

756
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,700
like I said White had black had nothing

757
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,440
to do with Hats unfortunately but rather

758
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,919
good or bad threat actors okay uh NSM

759
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,200
collects data we can use for forensics I

760
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,840
only put that one in here because it's a

761
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,640
conversation I had recently with one of

762
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,700
our managers is what is that and why do

763
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,260
we need it and why is it so expensive

764
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,140
and so I had to explain kind of not that

765
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,400
they're I don't want you to think I'm

766
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,900
trying to think these people are

767
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,460
uneducated but again they're just not

768
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,980
security educated okay so when you start

769
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,779
saying off all these things and I'm sure

770
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:27,059
my husband can attest to this too you

771
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,980
totally lose your audience right and so

772
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,299
you need to make sure to put it in

773
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,400
simple terms so that people that don't

774
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,799
live in this world and don't wear the

775
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,539
tinfoil hats know what you're talking

776
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,039
about right

777
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,020
so what can you do on the daily okay

778
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,940
keeping interest articles you may find

779
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,220
relevant can be shared with your team I

780
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,039
obnoxiously send out articles all the

781
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,200
time that I find you know I Apple iPhone

782
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,600
vulnerability you know Android

783
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
vulnerability bloop that gets sent too

784
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,760
oh it looks like uh Amazon was hacked

785
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,260
bloop you're gonna get that email too

786
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,080
and it's not to overwhelm our users but

787
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,419
it's to educate them I actually took

788
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,820
kind of a Hiatus from sending emails out

789
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,960
and I actually got a lot of people

790
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,760
asking like where those emails go I need

791
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,580
to know like my security cameras are you

792
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,559
know being compromised or baby monitors

793
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,899
or going crazy from people in China or

794
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,120
whatever so they they actually like that

795
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,039
information you're really empowering

796
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,960
your users to be up to date with what's

797
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,240
going on in security world right

798
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,340
send out reminders to all staff on

799
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,200
security best practices kind of the same

800
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,820
thing about monthly just send out a

801
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,020
newsletter it doesn't have to be

802
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,179
anything fancy it doesn't have to be

803
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,520
like 500 pages I try to make three

804
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,220
bullets you know password security why

805
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,860
do we do it how long do you need to make

806
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,260
it why do you have symbols in it why

807
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,539
can't we not go with shorter passwords

808
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,279
you know

809
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,080
what's fun about no before that I do

810
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,340
like is they have like this Captain

811
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,600
awareness

812
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,059
I don't know people like having an icon

813
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,159
when it comes to security

814
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,020
we tried to make our own and it turned

815
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,460
into a little bug and then Cove had

816
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,260
happened and that was a bad idea so

817
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,659
anyways we stuck with the more super

818
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,020
Superman type type logo there create an

819
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,940
engaging environment my favorite thing

820
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,760
to do in the whole wide world is do

821
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,860
Department versus department they are

822
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,140
competitive especially when you start

823
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,059
getting into like the police and fire

824
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,179
department it's crazy it's crazy you

825
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,580
send like Finance against HR and

826
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,740
security training and it gets really it

827
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,000
gets really heated there's a lot of

828
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,799
insults and sometimes you have to you

829
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,480
have to intervene no just kidding it's

830
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,460
not that bad but they do use

831
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,880
leaderboards as bragging rights okay

832
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,620
they don't even win anything half the

833
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,940
time I mean sometimes I give a pizza

834
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,039
party yes adults still like pizza

835
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,440
parties believe it or not but I

836
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,700
definitely like creating engaging

837
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,500
environments I do a lot of giveaways I

838
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,020
try to buy like I don't know a couple

839
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,880
backpacks people love backpacks people

840
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,820
love color changing bottles people love

841
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,679
just tangible things that they can use

842
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,419
like obviously in Sioux Falls there's a

843
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,880
lot of fishing people hence why my

844
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,380
communications Department made us this

845
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,600
cool little don't feed the fish stickers

846
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,659
right it's pretty pretty nifty there

847
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,580
a lot of fishing people so we did like

848
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,200
lunch boxes and things for people that

849
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,760
go camping you know

850
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,140
um and they love it they love doing the

851
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,820
security awareness training

852
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,860
um we actually kind of traced the

853
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,840
engagement rate when we started uh doing

854
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,860
training

855
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,120
um we started with probably about like a

856
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,220
10 engagement which kind of sucks right

857
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,620
it's like 100 people

858
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,620
and then this last one we did we had it

859
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,720
up to 23 and I know that doesn't sound

860
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,960
like a lot but 23 is is almost double

861
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,760
the increase in what we're getting back

862
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,220
from our users so it's a huge benefit to

863
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,620
us right uh you spend you know a couple

864
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,600
hundred dollars on silly things and

865
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,820
people will do training for practically

866
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,140
nothing right

867
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,940
and then build Partnerships with other

868
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,260
departments and ask for their help

869
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,299
getting the word out I'm telling you

870
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,460
communication with other departments is

871
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,020
probably the strongest suit I have to

872
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,820
this day people know me and I don't even

873
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,320
know them sometimes

874
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,039
I'm just like obviously

875
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,419
the one who goes around and tells

876
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,100
everybody about security

877
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,020
but you know they ask me questions

878
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,480
personal questions sometimes how can I

879
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,919
set up multi-factor and I've never

880
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,419
turned anyone down you know I say okay

881
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,820
let's take a look oh I got an email from

882
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,679
so and so is this legitimate and they

883
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,539
call me yes we have a phishing button

884
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,980
yes they can click on the fishing button

885
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,919
but I'm okay with them calling me ask me

886
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
ask me questions I would love to help

887
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,419
okay go go to different departments talk

888
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:32,220
to them help them any questions they

889
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,679
have ask them you know do a review every

890
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,600
year like what can we do to make your

891
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,340
lives better no I can't shut off the

892
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,899
endpoint protection it's still going to

893
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:41,460
be there but what else would you like

894
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,500
you know things like that this I'm

895
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,760
telling you it's these little things you

896
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,640
can do to make a more engaging security

897
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,860
environment and don't get discouraged

898
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,080
and this one's hard when I did my first

899
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,240
project and it kind of failed I felt

900
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,039
really bummed out I felt like I didn't

901
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,720
understand security

902
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,760
I was new in the field and I felt like

903
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,799
wow I really screwed up and I just got

904
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,899
started right but never alienate

905
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,419
yourself from your team you need them no

906
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,460
matter you know how close you are with

907
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,840
your team it's always going to be kind

908
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,159
of like a family and you're going to

909
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:11,940
fight

910
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,860
but eventually you'll need them on your

911
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,419
side so you need to talk to them

912
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,100
especially when they support the teams

913
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,200
that you're trying to get engaged so

914
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,659
talk with them help them support them

915
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,519
with your technology okay

916
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,360
everyone is busy make priorities and

917
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
deadlines okay

918
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,799
everyone's busy I don't know anyone who

919
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,720
works anywhere that says I have so much

920
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,360
free time and if you do Kudos because I

921
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,740
don't

922
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,440
um so you have to say you know oh this

923
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,720
training is an hour but you have four

924
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,000
months to do it like in four months if

925
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,340
you if I can take the training then you

926
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,860
can take the training um and I try to I

927
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,659
try to get a laugh out of it I say well

928
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,760
it took me 20 minutes so how long did it

929
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,519
take you you know so make priorities and

930
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,440
deadlines a thing schedule out your

931
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,820
projects and make sure everybody knows

932
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,679
about them okay not just for security

933
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,299
awareness training but when you're doing

934
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:04,860
things like

935
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,720
firewall upgrades and things like that

936
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,280
you need to make sure that everyone's on

937
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,980
the same page with your deadlines and my

938
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,659
favorite is always get it in writing

939
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,179
okay yeah you'll meet you'll get a lot

940
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,679
of promises but make sure that's in

941
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,760
writing so you can bring it back up

942
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,679
later and say you know you said we could

943
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,800
do this so here it is right here and be

944
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,679
patient okay again this is hard

945
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,099
sometimes and maybe not everyone we get

946
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,440
so excited about new technology and we

947
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,359
get so excited about changes we want to

948
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,399
make in the environment and sometimes we

949
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,379
even get scared and sometimes we see a

950
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,060
vulnerability come through and we say we

951
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,300
need to patch that like now okay one of

952
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,800
the recent ones was the print nightmare

953
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,260
vulnerability boy wasn't that fun that

954
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,659
was a fun July 4th weekend

955
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,580
but you know what

956
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,060
you have to be patient because if I you

957
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,580
know applied a patch for that

958
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,980
vulnerability when it came out we would

959
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,720
have took out printing for the entire

960
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,599
city and can you imagine

961
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,160
who is going to call me first the

962
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,680
library about how their patrons couldn't

963
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,140
print right and so you have to be able

964
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,180
to make exceptions sometimes even though

965
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,280
it was best practice to patch but you

966
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,680
can patch and make sure their print

967
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,480
services are still going so always be

968
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
patient with your users okay it's not

969
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,260
always about we need to do now it's what

970
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,660
we need to do now but we have to make

971
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,240
you know you know sure we're functional

972
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,700
as well okay and you'll not win everyone

973
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,579
over I'm sure I have fans out there that

974
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,320
see me walk by and they're like oh I

975
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,079
hate training and that's not all I do

976
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,540
but that's all they think I do and if

977
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,540
you fail try and try again

978
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,820
with the security education I brought

979
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,280
that forward to my team and they said no

980
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,599
we don't really need that right now

981
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,280
that's expensive let's look at it a

982
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,320
different budget year and then a

983
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,119
neighboring County got ransomware and

984
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,099
all of a sudden we had funding for it so

985
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,079
be patient eventually you'll get the

986
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,780
money you need to keep making sure your

987
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,119
infrastructure is secure right

988
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,880
and always work towards Improvement you

989
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,740
know always explore ways to improve your

990
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,820
environment

991
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,040
this includes looking at new technology

992
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,079
even if it seems out of budget now even

993
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,040
if it seems something that's

994
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,380
unreasonable there's always new software

995
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,940
and new challenges that you're going to

996
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,880
face AI technology and security is a big

997
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,920
key word right now or whatever you know

998
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,119
everyone wants to say oh we have

999
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,980
artificial intelligence and it's going

1000
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,980
to develop you know endpoint protection

1001
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,780
and you're not going to have to touch it

1002
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,359
which we all know is a lie anytime you

1003
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,280
ever get sold is something that security

1004
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,780
that says you're never going to touch it

1005
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,640
it's a lie but anyways

1006
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,040
there's always new things to explore out

1007
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,660
there it's just like educating ourselves

1008
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,400
and I think in security we all know that

1009
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,900
right you always have to stay up to date

1010
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,820
you always have to stay most

1011
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,980
knowledgeable on what's out there and

1012
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,599
then find ways to reach all members of

1013
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,579
your organization I took some couple

1014
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,800
classes on this actually for my teams

1015
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,040
because I learned not everybody learns

1016
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,359
the same there's different types of

1017
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,800
communication right there's verbal

1018
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,020
there's written there's visual I know

1019
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,300
this sounds kind of like off scope here

1020
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,820
but but really maybe an email doesn't

1021
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,500
get through to everybody maybe you hold

1022
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,180
an in-person training

1023
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,579
nobody wants to do it but it's best for

1024
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,079
your team okay

1025
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,700
um just talking with someone on the side

1026
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,040
through an application or a security

1027
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,700
issue they're having you have to learn

1028
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,680
how people learn okay to be able to help

1029
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,020
them and then challenge your approach if

1030
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,339
you're trying to sell something and it's

1031
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,680
not working maybe it's you and not them

1032
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,599
that needs to review go back to the

1033
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,820
board and figure out how you can better

1034
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,339
organize or better explain why you need

1035
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,200
something in your environment or how you

1036
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,359
can improve something okay because it's

1037
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,060
not always your idea or your mind that

1038
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,440
they can read so you need to make sure

1039
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,480
that you have it in a way that they can

1040
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,160
understand okay

1041
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,320
and my favorite is sometimes you have to

1042
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,960
be the bad guy I mean in security it's

1043
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,240
just what it is uh all fun and games

1044
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,520
security is a serious topic and I tell

1045
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,380
you I like to try and sell it to my

1046
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,260
employees but you know if you fail no

1047
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,940
before you fail your training you're

1048
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,320
gonna get me on the phone and we're

1049
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,579
gonna have a sit down and we're going to

1050
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,079
have a personal one-on-one educational

1051
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,000
opportunity that just sounds like a

1052
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,339
one-way ticket to fun but it is what it

1053
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,859
is it's security okay it's the model of

1054
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,119
the industry that your end users are

1055
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,560
your first line of defense we all know

1056
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,800
this okay so you might as well get used

1057
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,839
to it and work with them make it

1058
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,880
interesting and engaging

1059
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,640
okay bring all the facts to the table

1060
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,740
you will get challenged and everybody

1061
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,380
knows this every little aspect on

1062
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,820
everything you do will always be

1063
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,220
challenged and why you make things more

1064
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,800
difficult okay so bring the facts to the

1065
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,380
table and be willing to implement change

1066
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,839
and challenge standards which I think is

1067
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,240
one of the hardest things to do

1068
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,579
you know I was looking at one of the

1069
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:51,660
things we need to do as a local

1070
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,520
government that we've been asked

1071
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,380
recently is to change our domain from

1072
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,579
a.com to a dot gov domain which if you

1073
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,000
know that's a very Hefty thing to do

1074
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,859
and I have to sell that to my team

1075
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:08,119
somehow and so you have to challenge

1076
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,300
their noves and their maybes and you

1077
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,740
have to say in the long run this is

1078
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,900
going to be a benefit and I'm not going

1079
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,400
to back down from this it's something

1080
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,079
that I'm going to bring up and

1081
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,640
eventually it will happen it's going to

1082
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,140
take time like I mentioned earlier you

1083
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,060
have to be patient

1084
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,460
so like I said be willing to challenge

1085
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,960
these standards and communicate

1086
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,880
effectively like if you don't

1087
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,740
communicate effectively then who are you

1088
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,940
really serving

1089
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,859
and this is a fun little picture this is

1090
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,200
my boss actually and I got him to go on

1091
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,240
video with me doing a talk for security

1092
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,700
and we're like the two most awkward

1093
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,380
people when it comes to trying to sell

1094
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,180
so we get up there and we're like hey no

1095
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,099
before it's so fun you want to win this

1096
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,839
cup take the training you know so

1097
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,579
there's us trying to not be nervous as

1098
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,540
heck

1099
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,339
yeah and I'm gonna end a little bit

1100
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,099
early here but are there any questions

1101
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,540
yeah go ahead

1102
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,700
oh I appreciate it yeah it's it's

1103
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,020
challenging like I said I've been

1104
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,579
working at the city for four and a half

1105
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,140
years

1106
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,480
I don't feel like I'm an expert but this

1107
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,160
is from what I've learned from my teams

1108
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,440
this is what's helped served us best

1109
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,280
um and maybe it won't work in

1110
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,079
everybody's environment but I appreciate

1111
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,460
that

1112
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,560
any other questions

1113
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,359
I mean I don't have goldfish like I

1114
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,859
usually do for my training classes to

1115
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,759
handout but

1116
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,200
no they have to be sealed they have to

1117
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,780
be sealed packages

1118
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,460
a goldfish

1119
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,320
not that kind of oh I don't hand out

1120
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,520
live goldfish

1121
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,579
well thank you all for your time today

1122
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:47,720
and I appreciate you hanging out

1123
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,020
thanks Caitlin very much and I I'll

1124
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,240
follow up on what he said I've done what

1125
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,339
you do all the things you say that

1126
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:57,839
absolutely

1127
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,240
treat people as people give them food

1128
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,880
they will come

1129
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,000
seriously and uh the these are the

1130
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,560
people we have to educate we educate

1131
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,940
each other doing the highly technical

1132
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,220
stuff that's very cool and we all have

1133
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,079
fun and I love to type in the at the

1134
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,780
command line but it's people that we

1135
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,180
have to remember so remember that y'all

1136
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,200
be kind to each other
