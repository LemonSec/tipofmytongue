and to put that out there honestly I

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,240
prefer talks where like the audience

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,219
participates so if you have questions or

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,260
if you just say I'm full of crap or

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,640
whatever if you're you want to point

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,039
something out that I misspoke please do

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,539
that raise your hand or just yell louder

12
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,520
than everybody else and if you put

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,320
something in the Discord I will try and

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,160
speak it in a different voice

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,260
but you know I only have a few so let's

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,640
see what kind of voices yeah seriously

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,320
if there's a question in Discord feel

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
free to interrupt me in the middle or

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,440
whatever or if it's you feel it's more

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,360
appropriate to wait that's whatever nice

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,640
beard I think is what the graphic is

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,320
saying thank you thank you I worked very

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,000
hard for that no I had this weird thing

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,739
so my wife thought I should shave my

25
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,420
head because I she's like you have a

26
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,559
nice shaped head let me just pull that

27
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,360
off you have a nice shaved shaped head

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,219
and I'm like I don't know if I shave my

29
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,539
head like you don't come back from that

30
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,039
right like that takes a while that's

31
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,020
kind of hard and uh one day we were

32
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,520
saying we used to run this fireworks

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,440
tent and we're sitting there one July

34
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,180
like July 2nd and she's like you should

35
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,379
shave your head I really think it'd look

36
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,240
good and I said tell you what I'll do it

37
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,500
but I'm going to girl one of those Duck

38
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,060
Commander beards that was before Duck

39
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,260
Dynasty right it was just the Duck

40
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,540
Commander and uh

41
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,979
and she looked at me and I looked at her

42
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:14,939
and she said

43
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,500
deal

44
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,000
and I thought oh crap what did I get

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,780
into

46
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,540
and so right this is July and so I went

47
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,000
to Defcon a few weeks later and there

48
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,860
was a group doing mohawks for charity

49
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,020
and so I'm like yeah I threw 50 bucks to

50
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,360
hackers for charity I think it was and I

51
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,759
came home with a blue Mohawk and I live

52
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,080
in Oklahoma and it's kind of

53
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,400
conservative I mean there's some Mohawks

54
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,840
here and there but that that made a

55
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,700
splash so I wore it for a week to work

56
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,079
and let everybody laugh and had a good

57
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,520
time and then I shaved it and I started

58
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,140
growing my beard and I got to this

59
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,119
length in about six or seven months and

60
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,380
hasn't really grown since I was like 10

61
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,259
or 12 years ago so it is what it is but

62
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,700
enough about this because you keep

63
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,159
buttoning on your catching it in my

64
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,399
shirt and that is it is a coping it's a

65
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,740
stress coping mechanism to do this yes I

66
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,479
do I do catch myself doing that front

67
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,759
and and your wife's still this is still

68
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,920
passes the special acceptance yes she

69
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,840
she likes it honestly I've had several

70
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,119
kids since I grew the beard yeah so like

71
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,739
my oldest would recognize me well no I

72
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,000
mean he was young I don't even know that

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,319
they would know who I was if I shaved it

74
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,420
to be fair I look like I'm 12 without a

75
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,580
beard so anyway let's move on how about

76
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,640

87
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,080
besides organizations

88
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,300

135
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,260
the time

136
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,780
here's the thing infosec is sort of a

137
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,340
fantasy land to some degree I mean we

138
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,440
even have our own lingo right like hey

139
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,139
did you hear about that zero day in the

140
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,000
in the uh IAM API from RSA or did you

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
know is the coolest thing since that

142
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,220
ssrf and the laugh of the AP I don't

143
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,520
know AWS ec2 I'm making stuff up at this

144
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,720
point I don't know we have our own

145
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,520
terminology we have our own lingo we get

146
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,979
excited we get angry about things

147
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,380
how many times in the last two months

148
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,300
have you been angry about something

149
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,639
related to infosec

150
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,680
I've seen lots of smiles nobody wants to

151
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,060
raise their hand but right we get angry

152
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,639
why do we get angry about this it's a

153
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,780
job

154
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,940
why do we get angry and emotional and

155
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,280
excited about stuff like this it's

156
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,199
because we're passionate

157
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,000
it is a little bit of a fantasy land

158
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,860
it's a place where we invest our lives

159
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,540
and we care

160
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,940
sometimes we care too much the problem

161
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,820
is all of those things the way we make

162
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,979
decisions are not necessarily good

163
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,860
they're not well-founded people suck in

164
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,960
general and I'm including myself our our

165
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,460
meatware is broken there are

166
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,979
vulnerabilities in our meatware in our

167
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,600
psychology and the way we make decisions

168
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,460
and whatnot so kind of what I want to

169
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,320
talk about a little bit today is some of

170
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,180
that process before I do that and we're

171
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,560
going to talk about risk management and

172
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,479
and how this applies what not before I

173
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,160
do that I at least have to summarize the

174
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,680
idea of the minds of morya where this is

175
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,780
based on up so this is a scene from the

176
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,340
movie here's what's going on you've got

177
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,139
this little Fellowship a bunch of

178
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,300
basically white guys lots of diversity

179
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,440
yay

180
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,720
um let's call them the management team

181
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,699
and they're taking this dangerous little

182
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,639
ring this little jewelry piece down on

183
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,960
some trip and they have to deliver it

184
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,699
for the business line

185
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,740
and there's a complication right they're

186
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,820
going along one way and they're like how

187
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,259
do we get there and and one of the guys

188
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,699
says oh we should take this trip you

189
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,020
know we can take a shortcut through the

190
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,699
minds of Moria no problem it'll be great

191
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,620
it's the best place ever I'll introduce

192
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,020
you to my cousin it's awesome and you

193
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,639
got another guy that's like that's a

194
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,100
horrible idea really bad lots of risk

195
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,960
very dangerous we cannot go there right

196
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,460
they're probably like posting to

197
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,319
each other on Twitter about it you've

198
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,880
got another guy kind of the manager of

199
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,880
the group Gandalf who's like yeah I

200
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,500
don't know what seems kind of sketchy

201
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,660
and then everybody else is like nope

202
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,740
don't know anything about it not gonna

203
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,180
say anything I'm out of it I don't care

204
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,259
I don't want to be in the middle of it

205
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,699
right we've all been in those management

206
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,860
meetings right you can recognize you're

207
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,419
you're putting names to some of these

208
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,860
characters of like yeah that's the guy

209
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,479
that he's always like yeah whatever no

210
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,100
risk let's do whatever we got to get

211
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,780
stuff done and then the other guy that's

212
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,580
like it doesn't matter what you propose

213
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,500
it's too risky we can't take any chance

214
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,639
there's too much risk we're not going to

215
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,720
do it

216
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,280
this is like most of our risk

217
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,360
discussions

218
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,919
I'm going to move my thing here so my

219
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,500
clicker broke I had a clip no it kind of

220
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,539
broke I gave it away one of my

221
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:07,620
co-workers needed clicker I'm like here

222
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,639
this one's broke you can have it and

223
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,340
then I realized that's the one in my bag

224
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,680
um the short version is

225
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,479
they decide to take the shortcut which

226
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,740
actually worked out well for the movie

227
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,699
it would have been kind of boring if

228
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,139
they didn't but they took the shortcut

229
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,699
through the through the minds of Moria

230
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,460
they ended up in this dead orc infested

231
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,940
Fortress underground and it just went

232
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,979
South from there and got worse

233
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,560
here's what they didn't do

234
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,720
they never actually and and to be fair

235
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,280
it was a long movie already it would

236
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,479
have been much more boring if they had

237
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,160
done this they didn't sit down and say

238
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,539
okay what are the risks what are the

239
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,759
threats what actually could happen

240
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,319
more importantly what do we do to

241
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,300
mitigate some of those threats right

242
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,160
you've got this one little hobbit little

243
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,819
short guy that's carrying this ring that

244
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,979
can destroy the world right literally at

245
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,539
that point that is the most important

246
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:55,440
thing

247
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,780
and they didn't like let's surround him

248
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,979
and walk through this and watch for

249
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,300
stuff no they just wandered in there

250
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,039
here let's take a break let's you know I

251
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,500
mean there was no concern at all really

252
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,639
obviously at this point right they're

253
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,720
pointing weapons because they hear

254
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,460
something bad and they're like oh crap

255
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,919
we didn't plan for this what now right

256
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,860
vacations canceled everybody's on Deck

257
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,780
this is how we make a lot of risk

258
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,759
decisions

259
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,039
there we go so there's a lot of reasons

260
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,319
for this a lot of different motivations

261
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,819
sometimes it's economics and by

262
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:24,900
economics I mean a lot of different

263
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,580
things maybe it's if we make a different

264
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,840
decision it's going to cost us more

265
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,259
maybe it's if we do this we can it's uh

266
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,479
it's a product differentiation right we

267
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,740
can make a little bit more money off of

268
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,839
it if we do this way maybe it's just the

269
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,039
amount of time it's going to take we

270
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,479
don't want to wait for that or this or

271
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,979
whatever it might be it's going to take

272
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,360
more resources we don't have those

273
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,500
resources

274
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,020
usability how many people use Microsoft

275
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,940
Windows have you ever heard of it

276
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,800
like the great thing about Microsoft

277
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,740
Windows is you log in in one place and

278
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,420
you have access to everything

279
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,160
that's glorious

280
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
the downside to Microsoft Windows is if

281
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,880
you compromise One account you have

282
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,980
access to everything right like it makes

283
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,519
it so easy to to Pivot around all right

284
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,800
a shared authentication it's great

285
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,600
but there's downsides that come with it

286
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
and I guarantee you night and in fact I

287
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,019
have another a deeper example of this

288
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,640
later but people don't think through the

289
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,380
ramifications of okay what does this

290
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,540
really mean what do we do about it

291
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,160
there's convenience uh I'll come back

292
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,420
some of these some examples on these a

293
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,660
little bit later laziness

294
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,820
we've all been there right it's like

295
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,680
I know this is the right way to do this

296
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,000
but

297
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,279
I just don't insurance I mentioned

298
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,260
earlier I run besides okay

299
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,300
we have insurance now we're finally like

300
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,160
all right yeah I know we need to do this

301
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
for the for the longest time we're just

302
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,820
like do we really need to buy insurance

303
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,399
for this like what's the likelihood I

304
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,839
mean we have a we have a code of conduct

305
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,940
it's don't be an ass we're eight years

306
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,220
in and we haven't had a problem

307
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,700
but okay fine we we're like we're going

308
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,380
to be big boys let's buy insurance let's

309
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,580
be a little bit more serious about stuff

310
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,560
like that sometimes it's ignorance

311
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,019
earlier I was on we we kind of had a we

312
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,519
were just filling some some Gap space in

313
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,420
here and I was talking to a gentleman

314
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,940
instead over here about the complexities

315
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,519
of our infosec world and and how do we

316
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,080
hire people and just how complicated

317
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,940
things are technology has gotten

318
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,500
extremely complicated

319
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,600
and we're all ignorant about something

320
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,300
there there is nobody I don't know any

321
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,399
infosec Superstar Rockstar whatever that

322
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,019
knows everything about everything in

323
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,580
fact I think the the longer you're in

324
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,080
this industry the more you realize how

325
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,180
much you don't know right I am ignorant

326
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,220
on so many things it's uh my boss always

327
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,660
talks about like he started when he got

328
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,740
an emphasize he's like you know what I'm

329
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,060
gonna make a list of the five most

330
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,339
important things that I need to know and

331
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,360
he went through and he worked really

332
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,339
hard and he learned the first two and

333
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,680
then he had a list of 10 the most

334
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,880
important things that he doesn't know

335
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,560
and then he learned like two or three

336
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,120
more and then he had a list of like 30

337
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,500
of the most important things he doesn't

338
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,820
know right like that's the way this

339
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,860
thing is the further along we get the

340
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,300
more we realize we don't know and

341
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,459
ignorance is not an insult

342
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,019
I know people get insulted if you call

343
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,000
them ignorant don't try it or do that's

344
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,820
fun on Twitter just say you're ignorant

345
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,620
it doesn't mean stupid right ignorance

346
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,540
is a default State we are all born

347
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,820
ignorant we learn some things some of us

348
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,079
learn things about other things some of

349
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,120
us learn things about some different

350
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,500
other things

351
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,839
I would propose that any time you

352
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,700
disagree with somebody

353
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,860
Focus first on commenting on what they

354
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,060
do know

355
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,640
and how that differs from what you know

356
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,079
because as soon as you say because

357
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,339
that's the media doesn't want that right

358
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,019
I'm I'm gonna get into a political rant

359
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,040
here if I'm not careful right

360
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,420
everybody's trying to say it's US versus

361
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,880
them it's they they them them them and

362
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,440
it's like oh you know if they only knew

363
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
what I knew well yeah but if you only

364
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,160
knew what they knew maybe you would

365
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,060
think about it a little bit differently

366
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,760
right so ignorance is a big thing and

367
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,920
and it's really hard to say okay how do

368
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,779
we how do we teach everybody everything

369
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,640
so that we can make rationed reasonable

370
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,500
decisions we'll talk a little bit later

371
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,120
about how to do some of that and then

372
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,320
Dogma

373
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,000
I mentioned earlier about emotional some

374
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,620
of us just have this is the way it is

375
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,620
like how many people use emacs

376
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,140
no everybody uses VI

377
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,120
Nano

378
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,220
no

379
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,200
that guy's the only reason I use Nano is

380
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,060
because I learned on Pico right as I got

381
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,060
hpux and so Nano was an easy switch and

382
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,339
I know how to exit out of VI that's

383
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,560
about it

384
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,820
and even that I struggle with sometimes

385
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,740
but no I mean seriously we have these

386
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,680
dogmatic this is the way it is HTML

387
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,660
emails are important everybody needs to

388
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,640
to use them it's okay we have to we have

389
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,440
to protect users from themselves versus

390
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,959
no don't use an HTML email don't put

391
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,459
links in emails we teach people not to

392
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,600
click right we have these stupid

393
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,579
arguments back and forth and the user

394
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:33,959
sitting there is like you guys are just

395
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,880
wasting my time I'm going to make a

396
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,279
decision and the business moves on

397
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,920
and that's part of the issue is

398
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,019
the business Executives that are making

399
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,700
the decisions a lot of times this is the

400
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,260
input they get

401
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,240
all these different voices saying all

402
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,740
these different things

403
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,019
sometimes it's the wrong people saying

404
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,760
the right thing or the right person

405
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,860
saying the wrong thing sometimes it's

406
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,899
just too many voices sometimes we have

407
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,880
conflicting priorities the folks in Dev

408
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,100
and versus the folks in production

409
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,380
versus security team versus the Auditors

410
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,639
they're all saying hey you got to do

411
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,500
this you got to do this and what's the

412
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,180
manager going to do when you have to

413
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,100
make that decision what do you do

414
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,560
do you listen to the loudest voice

415
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,540
do you listen to the person who's been

416
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,639
right the most in the past

417
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,920
do you listen to the person that hey I'm

418
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,820
not going to listen to him because he

419
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,139
pissed me off he was a jerk so I'm gonna

420
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,660
it's hard right this goes back to our

421
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,240
meet where flaws of we all make

422
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,980
decisions for psychological reasons a

423
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,959
lot of times we don't even realize it

424
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,060
if we don't have a plan

425
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,560
and so that's that's what I want to

426
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,060
reiterate and hopefully by the end of

427
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,740
this talk that if you do let me just

428
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,779
jump in that how many people have a

429
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,100
detailed threat model for your

430
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,660
organization

431
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,519
like if I were to say hey here's this

432
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,620
thing we're thinking about doing

433
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,180
how do we analyze the risk to that how

434
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,320
many of you could say here's our threat

435
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,060
model let's look at that and apply that

436
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,220
and decide what's appropriate

437
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,440
anybody

438
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,060
nobody

439
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,420
like build that's she's like I don't

440
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,260
want to put it out there because I think

441
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,540
he's going to call on me it's not you

442
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,339
where you work okay

443
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,720
good enough that's good enough though

444
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,300
your organization has something right

445
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,740
that's literally what Jake was just

446
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,600
talking about right when he talked about

447
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,040
that camping trip and what are we going

448
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,660
to do and what are the actual risks and

449
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,820
how are we going to deal with it like if

450
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,639
you haven't thought those things through

451
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,899
you can't make valid risk decisions

452
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,940
you're gonna make risk decisions based

453
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,920
off the cuff some of you are going to be

454
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,959
great it's a lot of you not that's just

455
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,880
the way it works out

456
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,920
um unfortunately like we just don't have

457
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,279
standardization in our industry or in

458
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,560
our individual organizations we talked

459
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,700
earlier about how like I made the

460
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,500
comment that um

461
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,120
the automobile industry has been around

462
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,459
for over 100 years and there's a lot of

463
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:45,620
standardization

464
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,500
uh the friend of mine uh Jim bridenstein

465
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,899
used to be a U.S senator he was a house

466
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,579
what do you call a congressman House of

467
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,260
Representatives whatever and then he was

468
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,120
the administrator for for NASA for

469
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,440
several years

470
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,060
um I was talking to him about I didn't

471
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,740
realize this everybody thinks of NASA as

472
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,320
space right NASA actually has a lot of

473
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,880
responsibility for our

474
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,699
all of the space above the Earth it's

475
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,160
National Aeronautics and Space

476
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,899
Administration so he was talking about

477
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,480
the licensing of drones and NASA has

478
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,180
been tasked with how do we how do we

479
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,040
figure out what the roads of the sky

480
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,079
look like in terms of drones the FAA

481
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,120
handles about 400 feet they've got that

482
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,500
taken care of but everything below that

483
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,480
it's kind of NASA's responsibility or at

484
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,380
least they're in the middle of this

485
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,459
trying to figure out how to handle this

486
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,500
he's like there's hundreds of companies

487
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,940
thousands of companies that have drones

488
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,740
ready to go they want to deliver stuff

489
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,000
from one place to another they want to

490
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,320
pick people up and move them from one

491
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,120
another they want to do reconnaissance

492
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,980
for businesses or for the police or

493
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,139
whoever it's all out there ready to go

494
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,060
but there's no regulation around it

495
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,920
they're trying to figure that out

496
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,480
what they're trying to figure out is

497
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
standardization how do we do that you

498
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,839
can get in any car you can go down a

499
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,760
road and you know the rules you know you

500
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,199
stay on the right side you know that a

501
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,579
stop sign you stop you know what stop

502
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:57,959
lights look like you know right turn on

503
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,699
red there are standards that have

504
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,500
developed over hundreds of years

505
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,959
it has developed so quickly in the last

506
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,839
20 or 30 years that we don't have that

507
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,519
standardization everything is just so

508
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,399
much more complicated so I think two

509
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,440
things have to happen I think to start

510
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
with we have to build standardization in

511
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,839
our organizations your company has to

512
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,240
have a threat model you have to say here

513
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,860
are the big risks here are the threat

514
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,839
actors that are going against us here

515
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:25,860
are the things that we need to be

516
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,540
concerned about and what those risks

517
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,800
look like what those threats look like

518
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,540
and the risk they pose

519
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,600
but then eventually we have to figure

520
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
out how to standardize that as an

521
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,899
industry and we have to find ways to

522
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,120
make that work globally and I don't know

523
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,220
that's beyond the scope of this talk I

524
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,660
don't know how that works but hopefully

525
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,399
by the end I'll give you some tools to

526
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,779
stuff to think about for doing this in

527
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,519
your own order

528
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,800
so let me talk about some examples

529
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,839
how many people had an iPhone what is

530
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,459
this like the one the two I don't

531
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,360
remember

532
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,079
3G I had I had the three and the 3Gs was

533
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,040
it three the first one I couldn't

534
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,820
remember

535
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,720
okay I I got so frustrated because I had

536
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,419
the 3Gs and I couldn't uh I couldn't

537
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,819
turn into a hot spot with at T unless I

538
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,199
jailbroke it right they wouldn't give me

539
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,400
the functionality I wanted so I said

540
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,780
screw it I'm going to Android and I

541
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,699
never never looked back

542
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,500
how did this end up in in the Enterprise

543
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,720
does anybody remember

544
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,520
did we do a rational like let's think

545
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,500
through all the threats and dangers and

546
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,179
let's decide hey we have the tooling

547
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,980
that's available we have the you know

548
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,079
security controls that are available and

549
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,700
we're ready to roll this out in a secure

550
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,440
fashion

551
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,440
no what what happened

552
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,660
a vice president said I want it he

553
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,220
didn't say we need it he said I want it

554
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,559
the CEO said I'm I want this you're

555
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,360
going to do this and we said no we've

556
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,919
standardized on BlackBerry we have the

557
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,240
tools and the controls that we want

558
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,760
we've made this business decision and he

559
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,799
says that's fine make an exception for

560
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,740
me and somebody bent and then the CFO

561
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,900
said I want one too and the CIO said I

562
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,700
want one too and pretty much everybody

563
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,380
on the executive team and then it just

564
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,000
filtered down from there and at that

565
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,440
point we're thinking oh crap what do we

566
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,880
do we found a way to make it work

567
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,580
eventually right up front it was not

568
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,520
good yeah this is that's actually true I

569
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,179
upgraded the I did led the upgrade

570
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:13,440
forklift upgrade at a major

571
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,039
pharmaceutical company 18 000 people we

572
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,620
had a standard build it was Windows it

573
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,100
had the windows player and there was a

574
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,179
vice president who said I want iTunes

575
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:29,220
and we went round and round about it and

576
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,720
I said if you want it you got to sign

577
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,840
off on on the order that says this is

578
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,179
what we're going to do and then I got

579
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,280
called into the vice president's office

580
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,059
and said we're going to have iTunes and

581
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,940
I understood his tone voice and so we

582
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,919
had iTunes that's exactly right I'm

583
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,120
going to come back to that story I think

584
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,200
a little bit later when we talk about

585
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,240
what you should do about that or how do

586
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,679
we prevent that that time it's not

587
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,140
necessarily about preventing it our job

588
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,900
is not to say no and and okay this was

589
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,919
going to be later but I'm going to get

590
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,919
on this rant now I am so frustrated that

591
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,840
security has a reputation for saying no

592
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,940
that is not our job we are not here to

593
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,160
say no we are here to say here's how you

594
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,480
do that securely

595
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,220
you want to do that great here's what

596
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,720
that's going to cost here are the

597
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,220
resources the use you know whatever it's

598
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,539
going to take these are the things that

599
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:16,679
we need to do and if you're cool to sign

600
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,200
enough on that great let's do it but we

601
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
have to get away from the people that

602
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,900
say no you can't do that because then

603
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,460
they they're going to find a way to do

604
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,980
it anyway and it will get better it

605
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,020
always gets better can you have secure

606
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,240
iPhones on your Enterprise now well

607
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
that's maybe another dogmatic discussion

608
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
I don't know we could argue about that

609
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,360
but but yes compared back then much

610
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,760
better we have tools we have MDM we have

611
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,740
the ability to remote wipe and all this

612
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,600
kind of stuff it's awesome we always get

613
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,740
there eventually

614
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,260
but it starts slow and and the people in

615
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,480
the beginning kind of get screwed really

616
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,940
what about iot devices

617
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,340
this is the best uh image I could come

618
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,260
up with for iot devices I like the

619
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,760
washing machine here I was like I don't

620
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,260
have an iot washing machine but I'll be

621
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,880
honest if there was one that I could get

622
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,160
I probably would it's probably out there

623
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,320
I just don't I I'm all like

624
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,059
seriously my phone is going off right

625
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,380
now I had to take it out of my pocket

626
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,240
because the sprinkler people are working

627
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,340
on my yard and I told her they were

628
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,240
supposed to come last week and they

629
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
couldn't I'm like yeah you can come next

630
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,059
week but I'm at a conference so they're

631
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,559
like well we can just turn it on from

632
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,080
the garage you know beep beep beep but

633
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,400
it only runs for three minutes so it

634
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
runs for three minutes and it stops

635
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,039
every time it starts and stops I get a

636
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,260
notification and so I'm like anyway it

637
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,679
is what it is I'm a huge fan of iot

638
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,539
I've got my houses all wired up with all

639
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,919
kinds of things smart things I've got

640
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,080
cool stuff I do yes I have it properly

641
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,179
segmented on different segments so that

642
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,039
my kids on their computers and their

643
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,840
switches and whatever aren't going to

644
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,760
screw with stuff

645
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
but what happened in the Enterprise it

646
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,299
was the same thing marketing said hey we

647
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:46,919
need this widget for this thing that

648
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,740
we're doing and they plugged it in

649
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,140
somebody HR we got this thing legal we

650
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,760
got this thing the vice president won

651
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,140
something at a conference and says I

652
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,640
want to plug it in we've got this new

653
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,260
time clock that we can manage and make

654
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,700
sure that everybody's on time at the

655
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,679
right time right we plug in all of these

656
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,020
iot devices and it's the same type of

657
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,700
situation I need this thing I want this

658
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,380
thing let me do this thing and

659
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,120
eventually we've come up with ways of

660
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,320
here let me put that on a separate

661
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,880
segment let me manage that I think we're

662
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,860
still really struggling with this part

663
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,720
of the problem is these devices are low

664
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,220
cost they're designed to be the cheapest

665
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,960
out there they're really focused on

666
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,240
consumers in most cases we've got more

667
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,179
Enterprise type iot devices now but you

668
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,280
can't compete in the marketplace if you

669
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,440
put all the effort into security and so

670
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,940
what ends up happening is security takes

671
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,020
the last seat we'll get to that

672
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,640
eventually

673
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,200
you know when when this stuff started

674
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,580
happening we had no segmentation these

675
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,100
devices are almost never patched I I've

676
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,419
got smart thermostats you know how many

677
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,039
times I've patched my thermostats in the

678
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,460
last four years

679
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,159
thank you zero has anybody ever patched

680
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,600
their thermostat

681
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,799
I don't even know if there's a way to

682
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,880
patch them I don't know if there's

683
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,080
updates I don't know if there's is

684
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,880
possible I've never seen that my

685
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,020
marketing people just walked in so I

686
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,000
gotta be careful and Kathy marketing

687
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,559
person and Kathy how about that

688
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,179
person awesome

689
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:00,900
um

690
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,820
the thing is like these devices are just

691
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,080
out there waiting for vulnerabilities

692
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,640
and worms and we've seen all this kind

693
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,860
of stuff uh it'll end up on the network

694
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,380
eventually whether we have a defined way

695
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,360
to agree to it or not again I'm not

696
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,919
saying don't do it I'm saying we have to

697
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,740
be intentional about here's how we do it

698
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,360
software development

699
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,460
I started my career as a software

700
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,220
developer uh C plus plus and then PHP

701
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,080
got into web stuff we did not have

702
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,360
Frameworks like I remember was it Zend I

703
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,919
think was the PHP framework that came

704
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,280
out early 2001 two threesome in there

705
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,120
um

706
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,940
if I wrote something I wrote all of it

707
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,620
like I remember my programming course

708
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,659
with uh it was a data structures course

709
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,400
if you want to use a queue that's great

710
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,720
before you use the standard template

711
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,760
Library you have to do you have to write

712
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,020
your own queue once you've demonstrated

713
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,280
that you can do that then you can use

714
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,200
the library that was my introduction to

715
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,240
libraries but nowadays everything we

716
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,320
develop

717
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,880
half of it's written by all these other

718
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,320
people Alyssa was up here yesterday

719
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,500
Alyssa Miller and she talked about uh

720
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,720
software help me out software

721
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,620
composition analysis SCA and the idea of

722
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,840
figuring out which libraries you have

723
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,760
what they're being you what they're used

724
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,260
for what they're what they're doing and

725
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,760
how you patch and all that kind of stuff

726
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,260
when we started doing this why do we use

727
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,179
software Frameworks why do we have all

728
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,100
these different libraries is it because

729
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,760
it's more secure

730
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,860
come on wake up

731
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,600
make it easier

732
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,580
convenience that is part of it that was

733
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,840
kind of a trick question there is some

734
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,640
security Kevin and I taught the

735
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,440
application security class for a couple

736
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,380
days ago and part of part of it is I

737
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,419
tell people all the time don't roll your

738
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,280
own encryption your framework already

739
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,500
supports it use it don't build your own

740
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,760
session management you're going to screw

741
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,780
it up

742
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,159
use what they've already built for you

743
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,419
lots and lots of smart people have

744
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:49,799
troubleshooted and figured out the best

745
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,960
way to do it follow their guidance use

746
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,600
it there is security value in all these

747
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,039
libraries and Frameworks and using this

748
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:56,880
stuff

749
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,280
there's also convenience it's easier

750
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,780
it's faster we can deploy stuff more

751
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,840
quickly right it makes things like agile

752
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,299
possible as opposed to you know going

753
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,100
through the entire waterfall uh

754
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,600
methodology

755
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,299
but there's problems too and we often

756
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:13,980
look at here's what it gives me we don't

757
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,659
think about here's what it costs me and

758
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:16,679
that's what we got to do we got to be

759
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,600
able to look at those costs

760
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,039
um

761
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,740
yeah oh just as a bonus kind of the same

762
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,940
type of thing outside of software

763
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,679
development is the whole whole idea of

764
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,419
supply chain everything everything's

765
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,100
supply chain that means so much more

766
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,140
after covid than it did before but like

767
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,900
we all depend on this I can do this

768
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,299
because I can get that thing here right

769
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,340
we just assume it's possible and we

770
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,659
don't think about the risk of what if I

771
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,760
can't

772
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,940
okay has anybody seen this chart before

773
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,460
wow two people what is it

774
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,900
Microsoft what

775
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,640
it's the Microsoft privileged access

776
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,380
model somebody give that guy a beer

777
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,020
that's everybody said that you use

778
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,539
Microsoft Windows and you're all I

779
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,340
suppose security people or at least you

780
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,940
snuck into this conference somehow

781
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,760
this is Microsoft's documentation

782
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,760
on how to deploy accounts on Microsoft

783
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,039
Windows if you have any responsibility

784
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,380
for security over Microsoft network you

785
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,539
should be familiar with this

786
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:17,580
in their access model what they talk

787
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,500
about is account tearing this is a

788
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,640
countering we're all we all know about

789
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,140
Network segmentation Network

790
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,000
segmentation is important you know Jake

791
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,039
was just saying there's no reason this

792
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,360
group of workstations should be able to

793
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,220
access that group of workstations I was

794
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,360
talking about iot there's no reason

795
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,220
these iot devices need to be able to

796
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,720
connect to these other sensitive systems

797
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,880
right we block everything by default we

798
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,960
only allow stuff that needs to be

799
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,700
allowed we're all used to that people

800
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,559
have been banging that drum forever

801
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,179
but account tiering when I start talking

802
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:43,260
about account tiering people are like

803
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,240
wait what's that that's multiple

804
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,000
accounts right yeah Microsoft's model

805
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,799
for the from the beginning they've been

806
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,840
saying this for 20 something years

807
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,260
if you have lower level tier

808
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,240
so here they they do do it Opposite so

809
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,279
up here at the top tier zero you've got

810
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,640
your servers these are like your most

811
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,460
sensitive systems tier one maybe some

812
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,140
server some other things some consoles

813
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,820
some various things not quite as risky

814
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,559
right

815
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,960
I think think uh I deal a lot with PCI

816
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,880
so if you guys deal with that tier one

817
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,039
might be your your PCI scoped

818
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,779
environment tier one is like your system

819
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,820
administrators your other systems that

820
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,740
aren't quite insco but kind of related

821
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,539
and then tier two is like your other

822
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,940
workstations everything else now a lot

823
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,080
of organizations might be much more

824
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,279
complicated than that but that's what it

825
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,860
is here's the thing if you have an

826
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,679
account that has privileges on tier one

827
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,020
it should never log into tier two

828
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,539
we do the network segmentation but then

829
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,919
we don't do the account tearing to go

830
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,960
with it this is Microsoft's guidance

831
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,779
they said they acknowledge from the very

832
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,360
beginning this model we've created of

833
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,799
you log in here and you get access to

834
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,440
everything is great but it's extremely

835
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,380
dangerous if you put systems of

836
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,140
different risk levels together and you

837
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,299
let people log in to log into one from

838
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,520
the other but nobody ever reads this

839
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,020
nobody knows it except this guy I'm

840
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,159
thankful he was in the back of the room

841
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,600
and somebody else over here raised their

842
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,120
hand too so that's that's really

843
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,500
disappointing that at a security

844
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,240
conference people don't understand that

845
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,159
basic concept I'm not saying you don't

846
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,240
understand it but people aren't more

847
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,360
familiar with it

848
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,860
let me move on

849
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,559
devops devops is awesome it's kind of

850
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,120
like secure libraries

851
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,159
devops has really empowered a lot of

852
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,720
organizations to do a lot more things

853
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,000
quickly this is just some image that I

854
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,679
found of devops I honestly did not read

855
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,820
all the things around it and now I'm

856
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,380
worried about what it says to be honest

857
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,900
you ever do that don't do that

858
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,299
um devops is awesome that really works

859
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,500
well for a lot of organizations it

860
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,640
allows them to build things quickly

861
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,320
allows them to manage things quickly

862
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,659
there is a lot of benefit that comes

863
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,539
with it it's not necessarily all bad but

864
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,000
we also lose some things right anybody

865
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,220
got a cissp

866
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,200
nobody wants to admit to that there's a

867
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,320
couple yeah yes I have a cssp I'm in

868
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,580
recovery

869
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,639
um

870
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,320
you know from a management perspective

871
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,580
some of the controls that get talked

872
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,940
about are uh least privileged right if

873
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,140
you're a developer you don't need access

874
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,700
to production that's how one of the ways

875
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,020
that we control what could happen right

876
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,000
we have one person that develops one

877
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,559
person that deploys another person that

878
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,799
audits that process you know we separate

879
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,299
logging from from alerting and who has

880
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,700
access all this stuff we lose that when

881
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,500
we switch to a devop model because the

882
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,880
folks that are actually developing are

883
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,520
the folks that are supporting production

884
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,900
they're more interactive they have that

885
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,580
that's great there's a lot of power to

886
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,919
that but we lose something and we often

887
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:36,000
don't think about what that actually

888
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,700
means systems are more interconnected we

889
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,559
just need to reconsider those those

890
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,100
processes

891
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,260
um how many people use Crestron systems

892
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,960
you have these and you're like you're uh

893
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,559
meeting rooms and guest guest areas and

894
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,340
stuff like this you know what I'm

895
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,919
talking about these are like so this

896
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,659
actual system not this actual phone this

897
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,279
is a picture of of a different one of

898
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,740
the same model but we Kevin and I were

899
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,779
on site for a defense contractor in the

900
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:07,919
DC area uh last November actually and um

901
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,740
they they want to it wasn't the security

902
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,120
team that brought us in it was actually

903
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,279
like the head of audit or something and

904
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,659
he's like hey we go through normal pen

905
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,880
tests of all this stuff but we're

906
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,320
concerned about what's being missed

907
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,760
because that's ran by it and we don't

908
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,559
have direct access to that so we're

909
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,179
going to bring you to the building we're

910
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,159
going to put you in a guest room just

911
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,380
like we would other it vendors or guests

912
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,179
or whatever and we just want to see what

913
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,279
can happen like just have at it for a

914
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,539
couple hours you're in this building by

915
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,580
yourself see what can happen

916
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,740
we plugged into this and you know start

917
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,779
messing around looking at it and and

918
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,880
very quickly we found out that if we

919
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,320
unhook the phone and put a tap in the

920
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,279
middle and connect our computers

921
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,140
directly to it we're on the corporate

922
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,659
Network

923
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,679
we didn't believe it we're like I'm

924
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,120
sorry this is a defense contractor like

925
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,159
this is a big freaking deal like they

926
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,960
have classified stuff we don't know

927
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,539
exactly where it's at but we had done a

928
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:58,679
little bit of reconnaissance ahead of

929
00:29:58,679 --> 00:29:59,880
time and they had a whole bunch of

930
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,740
internal host names and stuff like that

931
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,320
that leaked out various places and so we

932
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,059
started poking at some of them and we

933
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,740
saw everything there was like no

934
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,059
internal segmentation that we could see

935
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:10,919
I'm sure they did they had something but

936
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,840
we couldn't see it we actually had to

937
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,720
contact our our contact and say

938
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,559
um

939
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,179
I don't know what's going on here like

940
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,740
is this a Honeypot are we missing

941
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,240
something we seem to have access to

942
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,140
everything he's like no that's not

943
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,760
possible and we showed him and he's like

944
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,760
yeah okay you can see the blood drained

945
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,840
from his face

946
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,220
and so we're talking about this and

947
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,240
we're like all right here's the thing

948
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,179
maybe you guys have controls that are

949
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,500
stricter than you realize about who can

950
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,299
get in these rooms maybe people aren't

951
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,740
allowed to be in here by themselves and

952
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,820
that's his part you know that's been

953
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,039
thought through he's like no he said

954
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,500
here's the problem I was hired last year

955
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,480
and when I was in this building to do an

956
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,200
interview

957
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,120
and I had to take a call

958
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,120
and my boss said oh yeah here you can

959
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,620
sit in this conference room and he left

960
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,240
me there for two hours by myself why I

961
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,059
took this call he's like if I go tell if

962
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,100
I report this up he's the one that's

963
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,299
going to get in trouble for it because

964
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,700
like he knows this he's part of all and

965
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,960
so there's this whole thought process

966
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,399
you saw him going through the conflict

967
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,919
of the political issues of

968
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,320
do we how do we how do we report this

969
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,640
because it's going to make us look bad

970
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,779
it's going to make him look bad what do

971
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:13,919
we do

972
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,659
later we got to talking to the people

973
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,159
who were actually responsible for this

974
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,020
and part of the conversation came up

975
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,720
that when we made this decision that was

976
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,100
a completely separate Network and it

977
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,659
wasn't that important we didn't it was

978
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:25,740
isolated

979
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,440
but then we got these new devices and

980
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,120
they have the ability to automatically

981
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,820
manage meetings and connect to exchange

982
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,799
and you know I can go to the thing on

983
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,179
the wall and say I want to reserve this

984
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,039
room from two to three invite this

985
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,659
person this person this person and it

986
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,279
will connect to exchange and send them

987
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,320
messages and and do all this stuff for

988
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,880
me and it's really cool and look at all

989
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,380
this new thing and you can tell the

990
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,179
salesperson whoever sold this system was

991
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,159
like this is awesome this is the future

992
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,000
right The Jetsons live down the street

993
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
but they didn't think through oh will

994
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,559
this work in our network no they said

995
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,120
hey we got to have this some executive

996
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,260
signed off on it and said yeah that's

997
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,179
cool open it up the security people were

998
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,860
like we can't open that if we do this we

999
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,980
do this but it got forced through anyway

1000
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,080
and so nobody went back and looked and

1001
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,580
like okay what are the actual threats

1002
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,380
that we talked about when we first did

1003
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,659
this are they still applicable what does

1004
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,140
this change

1005
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,480
does anybody remember the Capital One

1006
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,159
breach a couple years ago

1007
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,779
I kind of jokingly referenced it a

1008
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,700
little bit when I started

1009
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,080
um

1010
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
what was the deal does anybody know

1011
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,299
remember how they got in

1012
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,918
it was AWS

1013
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,320
uh maybe

1014
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,740
so it was an ssrf attack there was a

1015
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,720
WAFF they found a WAFF that was

1016
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,600
vulnerable to an ssrf attack and

1017
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,159
launched that great if you don't know

1018
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,260
what ssrf is it means that you can

1019
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,720
connect to one system and send malicious

1020
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,700
traffic that will cause it to connect to

1021
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,860
another system and then maybe and in

1022
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,600
this case it retrieves that information

1023
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,120
and sends it back to you well what a lot

1024
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,559
of people don't realize if you've not

1025
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,919
super familiar with AWS is AWS has a

1026
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,440
metadata

1027
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,679
API that's listening on localhost

1028
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,140
and every ec2 instance that you create

1029
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,700
in AWS has this API running locally you

1030
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,440
can't get rid of it it's there it allows

1031
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,179
you to query some magical Network

1032
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,399
metadata stuff that the AWS has out

1033
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,559
there

1034
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,559
this attacker knew enough about AWS they

1035
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,960
had actually worked at AWS previously so

1036
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,580
they knew the documentation a lot of

1037
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,840
people's like well they were an Insider

1038
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,519
they knew about AWS and they knew how to

1039
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,480
attack this no it didn't have anything

1040
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,120
to do with that they just knew how this

1041
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,519
worked they knew the technology and so

1042
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,260
when they found this ssrf vulnerability

1043
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,200
they were able to use that to query The

1044
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,419
Local Host because from you know the

1045
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:57,120
ssrf sent the information into the Waf

1046
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,220
the WAFF is running the web app firewall

1047
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,140
is running on that system it queried

1048
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,640
localhost and they were able to extract

1049
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,679
the metadata well there are two problems

1050
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,080
one is that Capital One didn't even know

1051
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,659
this was a thing they had not secured it

1052
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,418
in any way two the way that they had

1053
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,520
done their account models where you know

1054
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,199
what accounts had access to what

1055
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,239
resources and stuff like that was way

1056
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,300
too permissive because we have this hard

1057
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,639
shell nobody can access our internal

1058
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,540
side because we keep everything

1059
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,179
protected but once you got in those

1060
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,918
internal accounts then the attacker was

1061
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,719
able to get access to an account they

1062
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,219
had access to other data and all this

1063
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,179
kind of stuff

1064
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,639
here's what's interesting about that the

1065
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,940
80 million dollar fine that they got was

1066
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,040
not directly connected to the actual

1067
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,199
breached data

1068
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,599
the 80 million dollar fine was because

1069
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,820
the what is it the office of I always

1070
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,619
have to look this up the office of the

1071
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,000
Comptroller

1072
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,679
of the currency is that not a

1073
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,719
bureaucratic name the office of the

1074
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,219
Comptroller of the currency for the US

1075
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,660
government said

1076
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,339
Capital One

1077
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:02,880
is a large regulated organization and

1078
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,339
they moved stuff to AWS they just lifted

1079
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,260
and shifted their stuff over without

1080
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,480
understanding the technology

1081
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,280
and without knowing what it is they

1082
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,079
should be looking for in other words

1083
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,760
ultimately the way it was worded this

1084
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,079
was a problem for the Auditors they said

1085
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,640
your Auditors failed because you moved

1086
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,660
stuff without knowing it and the

1087
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,800
Auditors didn't even know how to look

1088
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,599
for it

1089
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,320
they admitted basically acknowledged

1090
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,880
vulnerabilities are going to happen

1091
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,900
attacks are going to happen breaches are

1092
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,160
going to happen but you've got to

1093
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,300
understand the technology you got to

1094
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,660
know what's there

1095
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,920
I'm almost done with examples I just

1096
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,480
they were so I kept I had this huge list

1097
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,800
I'm like all right I got to cut out

1098
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,780
examples anybody work with ICS stuff or

1099
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,599
scada stuff industrial control systems

1100
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,760
there are so many we've done a lot with

1101
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,040
power companies uh oil and natural gas

1102
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,560
and electric and whatnot all of those

1103
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,060
systems are online now I mean the

1104
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,320
smaller ones maybe they keep stuff

1105
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,599
offline I've got a friend that runs a a

1106
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,980
power

1107
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,940
um

1108
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,180
power generator for a dam a large Dam in

1109
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,740
Oklahoma he's this uh I don't remember

1110
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,020
what he is CSO or something like that

1111
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,619
um

1112
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,900
they are small enough he's like all of

1113
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,700
our stuff is offline now part of it is

1114
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,680
because the dam was built in 1930 in the

1115
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,240
the computer equipment was put in like a

1116
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,859
few years later and literally we haven't

1117
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,780
updated anything since and so I don't

1118
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,940
trust anything but he's like we we they

1119
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,260
had some system he's like we have to

1120
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,520
update this which means it has to be

1121
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,740
connected to the internet so like they

1122
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,760
brought in a separate internet

1123
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,380
connection connected it for the five

1124
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,880
minutes it took to do the update and

1125
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,020
then turned it off because they're so

1126
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,359
terrified of something bad happening

1127
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,420
um but in most larger organizations all

1128
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,800
of this stuff is connected to the

1129
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,420
internet in some way

1130
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,180
it has to be right we cannot manage

1131
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,280
sufficiently large organizations unless

1132
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,020
we're able to get logs unless we're able

1133
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,400
to do Federated identity and

1134
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,200
authentication unless we're able to keep

1135
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,520
track of what's Happening where we've

1136
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,900
got to be able to monitor things it's

1137
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,880
just not practical with the complexity

1138
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,560
of these systems to keep it all

1139
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,780
completely offline so we move it offline

1140
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,460
and that's great we have some more we

1141
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,140
have some security benefits from that

1142
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,900
right we can get detection of malicious

1143
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,820
activity we can get log data and alerts

1144
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,900
and all that kind of stuff that is a

1145
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,700
good thing we can make sure the stuff is

1146
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,859
patched and maintained those are good

1147
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,079
things but there's security implications

1148
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,760
that come along with it obviously we

1149
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,380
hear about in the news all these all the

1150
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,359
times these systems getting compromised

1151
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,680
or whatever

1152
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,160
again security win cost savings dangers

1153
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,140
that go along with it and what ends up

1154
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,820
happening again is that people don't

1155
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,640
fully look at all of the the pieces

1156
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,960
around it

1157
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,560
uh last example automatic updates how

1158
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,420
many people think automatic updates are

1159
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,500
great and should be turned on for

1160
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,680
everything

1161
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,680
couple I see some wavering back here how

1162
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,480
many people think that automatic updates

1163
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,060
are dangerous and shouldn't be turned on

1164
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,240
wow more that's more than I expected so

1165
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,220
when I got started in I.T

1166
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,599
we were at the point where like

1167
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,920
automatic updates were just kind of

1168
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,900
being a thing and it was like everybody

1169
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,880
was afraid of it no we can't turn I mean

1170
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,560
yeah maybe maybe for desktops or

1171
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,400
something but we're not going to turn

1172
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,380
automatic updates on for servers there's

1173
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,240
no chance I still remember

1174
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,920
um I remember when McAfee pushed down an

1175
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,560
automatic update that deleted

1176
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,940
um something that started with the word

1177
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,260
micro

1178
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,960
out of like system 32 and I don't know

1179
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,820
if you've heard of micros micros at the

1180
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,440
time was the largest restaurant point of

1181
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,520
sale system

1182
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,300
like in the country this one uh update

1183
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,079
the the McAfee put out literally hosed

1184
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,960
every micros server across the country

1185
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,640
like literally you could not check out

1186
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,619
at a restaurant for several days and

1187
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,980
it's like 2004 2005 something like that

1188
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,839
um we had just gotten to the point where

1189
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:38,040
people were starting to trust hey we

1190
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,240
have to do automatic updates for

1191
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,920
everything and then stuff like that

1192
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,240
happens and it's like okay now we can't

1193
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,619
do it for anything and then we started

1194
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,020
getting back there I remember like

1195
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,960
2010 11 12 when uh Firefox came out and

1196
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,339
said hey we're gonna turn on Autumn on

1197
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,140
automatic updates every time you can't

1198
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,119
turn it off if you have a system it's

1199
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,859
going to be automatically updated and

1200
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,839
everybody's like uh no and so like all

1201
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,400
the Enterprises started removing Firefox

1202
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,780
and then they backed off and they're

1203
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,339
like okay we'll give you the ability to

1204
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,720
turn it off and manage it but by default

1205
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,280
for everybody else's on and chrome

1206
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,720
started doing the same thing like right

1207
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,040
away they're like all right this is good

1208
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,720
we're in automatic updates for

1209
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,579
everything that was great and we kind of

1210
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,500
got back to that same point of now

1211
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,119
automatic updates are great and then

1212
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,099
like in January of this year Microsoft

1213
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:18,780
put out update you remember what I'm

1214
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,800
talking about does anybody remember this

1215
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,599
Microsoft put out an update that was

1216
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,280
there for like three or four days and it

1217
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,079
started crashing domain controllers and

1218
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,420
knocking file systems online offline and

1219
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,460
servers were rebooting and like three or

1220
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,480
four days later they pulled it and

1221
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,579
they're like oops are bad sorry

1222
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,680
so I don't know where we are with this

1223
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,540
like there are advantages to automatic

1224
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,220
updates there are disadvantages

1225
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,440
automatic updates there are savings

1226
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,920
there are costs how do we decide we're

1227
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,660
back to the point where context matters

1228
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,579
uh I didn't mention Nuance earlier but

1229
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,740
Nuance really really matters we have to

1230
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,440
think through these things of of is this

1231
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,480
right in this situation and not just

1232
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,740
globally what's what's good and what's

1233
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,980
bad

1234
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,700
PCI

1235
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,440
I have this love-hate relationship with

1236
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,000
PCI it's kind of what got me into

1237
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,200
security I worked for a point of sale

1238
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,060
reseller that I was talking about

1239
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,960
um

1240
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,400
I know more than I want to know about

1241
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,660
PCI

1242
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,760
and at times I hate everything about it

1243
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,920
passionately but I also see that it's

1244
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,619
done a lot of good things right a lot of

1245
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,119
merchants that otherwise would not have

1246
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,280
been cared about security at all have

1247
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,619
really made a lot of great improvements

1248
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,960
I'm bringing this up as a counter

1249
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,460
example to all the bad examples because

1250
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,200
one thing that PCI has done really

1251
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,460
really well

1252
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,920
has forced the idea of compensating

1253
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,300
controls

1254
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,280
PCI says here's this laundry list that

1255
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,839
it's not like like HIPAA is a government

1256
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,420
regulation that says basically do the

1257
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,040
best you can do for your business model

1258
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,960
and if you don't do good enough we'll

1259
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,760
sue you after the fact and so

1260
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,500
everybody's like what do we do here

1261
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,320
right like all the other starvanes Oxley

1262
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,500
FERPA uh glba like they're all fairly

1263
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,400
vague because they're government

1264
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,619
regulations and that's what they do

1265
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,760
PCI is a is a is a regulatory it's not a

1266
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,140
legal thing it's a contractual thing

1267
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,520
where they say you're going to do this

1268
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,380
or else we'll find you

1269
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,060
um and that's been awesome but what they

1270
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,740
introduced is this idea of compensating

1271
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,900
controls where they can say if you can't

1272
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,119
do this good enough here's this other

1273
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,920
thing you can do to make up for it and

1274
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,359
they force people to Think Through the

1275
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,339
ramifications of if I'm not going to do

1276
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,680
this what am I going to do instead and

1277
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,240
is that good enough and and I think

1278
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,300
that's a really good counter example

1279
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,520
but going back to infosec at the end of

1280
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,560
the day infosex a lot about like squid

1281
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,660
games does anybody watch squid games

1282
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,520
a couple people at least know what it is

1283
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,200
I've really start about it

1284
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,000
I don't know if it's good or not I I

1285
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,440
watched it a couple weeks ago on some

1286
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,579
flights

1287
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,500
I kind of like it I I can't I honestly

1288
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,300
can't decide I'm not a big Korean drama

1289
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,640
guy but but it was it was interesting

1290
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,940
here's the thing with Squid games

1291
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,579
it all works out in the end I mean for a

1292
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,720
couple of people the ones that don't get

1293
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,760
slaughtered

1294
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,079
that's kind of the way it is it is with

1295
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,380
infosec right whoever jumps first if

1296
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,060
you're the first one to say yep I'll do

1297
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,099
it I'll run out there and do this thing

1298
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,839
you're probably the one getting killed

1299
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,880
first or compromised is probably a

1300
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,140
slightly better way to say than that

1301
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,480
right but if you wait and see how it

1302
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,000
goes okay you can kind of see what's

1303
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,619
playing out and then that's the way

1304
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,540
infosec is right we jump out we have new

1305
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,280
technology we have new ideas whoever

1306
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,480
jumps on it first ends up getting

1307
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,520
compromised first and then eventually we

1308
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,920
build controls and solutions and you

1309
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,359
know come to reasons ways to think about

1310
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,400
this kind of stuff

1311
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,740
it's the arrows in the back model the

1312
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,900
arrows in the back yeah right yeah the

1313
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,160
arrows in the back whoever takes the the

1314
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,020
first part so a couple of ways that we

1315
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,280
fail at this

1316
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,599
um I've talked about all of these

1317
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:37,980
different things I think and just for

1318
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,980
time I'm going to kind of skip over here

1319
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,900
urgency emotion we get passionate about

1320
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,480
things insufficient information lack of

1321
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,339
experience we put people in positions

1322
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:48,780
that they're not really competent for

1323
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,400
the gentleman that I was having a

1324
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,839
conversation with earlier during the

1325
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,940
lunch hour you know he was saying you

1326
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,800
hire somebody you train them on on your

1327
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,540
Tech and they know what's going on and

1328
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,339
then after a couple of years they get a

1329
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,260
ten thousand dollar bonus to go to

1330
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,119
another company where they're doing it

1331
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,440
differently with different Tech and that

1332
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,359
guy learns that right we get people up

1333
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,579
to the level of competence and then they

1334
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,020
get a promotion to somewhere else where

1335
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,700
they're incompetent

1336
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,079
um that continues happen Nuance Nuance

1337
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:18,540
is difficult in conversations especially

1338
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,339
when you have lots of people

1339
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,380
trying to chime in and get their opinion

1340
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,300
heard it's really really hard to

1341
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,859
understand the Nuance of a particular

1342
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:28,380
type of risk but we have to we have to

1343
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,599
consider that political issues inner

1344
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,000
team conflict sometimes cowardice

1345
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,680
cowardice political cowardice is the

1346
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,900
reason we still have the Patriot Act

1347
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,240
nobody is going to vote

1348
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,599
to remove a safety feature

1349
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:45,420
that that could cause death later on

1350
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,520
because if that does let's say let's say

1351
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,200
they got they repealed the Patriot Act

1352
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,540
and then terrorists took advantage of

1353
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,700
something six weeks later that might

1354
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,740
have been detected by that that

1355
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,240
political person has done their career

1356
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,859
is over that will be reused against them

1357
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:00,540
over and over and over again we see the

1358
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,000
same thing in in businesses nobody wants

1359
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,740
to say that couldn't happen we don't

1360
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,480
need to invest in this security control

1361
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,800
we don't need to worry about this risk

1362
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,839
because if they do

1363
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,240
they get screwed in the long run so

1364
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,339
political cowardice often lets people

1365
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:15,480
say I don't want to take the risk I'm

1366
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,619
going to take the chance let's just play

1367
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,540
it safe or vice versa I just don't care

1368
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,220
I'm not gonna deal with it time

1369
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,900
resources no formal threat model process

1370
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,640
so that's the the big one that I want to

1371
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,800
leave you on what is a threat model and

1372
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,000
since there was only one person here

1373
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,440
that said they have a good threat model

1374
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,420
there are a lot of formal ways you can

1375
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,680
do this I mean literally you can take

1376
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,119
classes on threat models you can read

1377
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,119
books stride and pasta and Linden and

1378
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:37,740
all these other there's there's lots of

1379
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,940
them out there

1380
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,220
it doesn't have to be that formal at

1381
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,599
least especially for small business you

1382
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:43,859
can start small

1383
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,200
the majority of threat models that I've

1384
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,640
worked with with customers are

1385
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,260
spreadsheets they start out as a

1386
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,400
spreadsheet

1387
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,720
first thing you do abstract the

1388
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,760
environment what do we got what are we

1389
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,900
protecting

1390
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,700
maybe it's this you start with this one

1391
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,140
particular Network maybe it's a subset

1392
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,160
maybe you say hey we're just going to

1393
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,540
deal with PCI for now or we're just

1394
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,859
going to deal with you know this

1395
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:03,720
particular customer focused Network

1396
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,760
maybe it's not even just a network maybe

1397
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,920
it's a business model or something think

1398
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,200
about the data flight data flow diagram

1399
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,640
where does input come in where does

1400
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,920
output go out what's being processed in

1401
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,500
the middle map all that out come up with

1402
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,000
some abstraction so you can think about

1403
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,220
the different components I'm assuming

1404
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,420
you have an inventory of some of these

1405
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,640
systems if not that's number one and two

1406
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,619
on the CIS controls so that'd be a good

1407
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:28,099
place to start

1408
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,819
profiles

1409
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:31,980
of potential attackers some people call

1410
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,440
these threat agents uh Jake was talking

1411
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,579
about this a little bit about thinking

1412
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:36,960
through the types of people that would

1413
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,060
be attacked attackers some of these are

1414
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,339
going to be disgruntled former employees

1415
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,560
maybe disgruntled current employees

1416
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,060
you know random people on the internet

1417
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,040
somebody that's angry because your CEO

1418
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,880
said something political on Twitter

1419
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,740
that kind of cuts close to home my boss

1420
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,359
rants on Twitter all the time you know I

1421
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:55,260
mean like you have these different

1422
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,460
people that are going to attack you for

1423
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,660
different reasons maybe it is a

1424
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,520
nation-state maybe it's a you know just

1425
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,440
a ransomware group or whatever build

1426
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,300
profiles with these of what is their

1427
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,400
goal and motivations this can take a

1428
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,560
while it is some effort to do it I get

1429
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,119
it this is not necessarily an easy step

1430
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,460
it's a lot of documentation but think

1431
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,560
through who are the possible people that

1432
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,060
might come after us

1433
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,680
and then what are the potential threats

1434
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,020
if this person is going to attack us

1435
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,660
this person I'm using generically like

1436
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,400
this threat agent what would they do

1437
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,319
what are the types of attacks they could

1438
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:27,660
pull off and then for each one what is

1439
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,040
the likelihood of this what is the

1440
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,420
impact of this and what is the

1441
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,400
difficulty of this and for each one of

1442
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,480
those things then you look at your

1443
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,859
system you say okay what controls do we

1444
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,619
have in place to prevent this to detect

1445
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,619
this to respond to this right I I

1446
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,839
jokingly reference the cissp earlier

1447
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:44,339
like this is all management level

1448
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,140
information security stuff of working

1449
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,339
through

1450
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:48,839
here's our here's the potential

1451
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,640
attackers here's the potential attacks

1452
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,440
of attack here's the controls we have in

1453
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,300
place and then for each one of those is

1454
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,500
this good enough

1455
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,260
if you if you have a refined process for

1456
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,420
this it makes it a lot easier all of the

1457
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,339
other stuff I've talked about

1458
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:03,960
you can go through and say okay what if

1459
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,520
we do this well if we do this then that

1460
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,859
opens it up to this and then how do we

1461
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,839
compensate for that right like it gives

1462
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,280
you something to have a standardized

1463
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,040
process to say we can't make this

1464
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,720
decision because it opens up this much

1465
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,880
more risk or if we do we at least need

1466
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,200
to offset that somehow right we're

1467
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,880
always trying to be better I used to do

1468
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,920
CrossFit I don't anymore

1469
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,440
obviously I tried to out eat covid

1470
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,819
instead of outwork out you know like I

1471
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,140
didn't do the Dave Kennedy thing like

1472
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,240
let me get buff

1473
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,220
um but there was a lady that when I did

1474
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,200
CrossFit and to be fair there is a law

1475
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,700
that if when you meet somebody if you do

1476
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,839
CrossFit you have to tell them within

1477
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,280
the first five minutes it's like like

1478
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,040
vegan uh but I I didn't break that law

1479
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,020
because I don't do it anymore there was

1480
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,400
a lady that I work with that worked out

1481
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,900
with that had a shirt on that said um

1482
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,700
better than yesterday she always wore

1483
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,560
that t-shirt better than yesterday and I

1484
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,359
think that's what we need to focus on in

1485
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:52,920
whatever your organization is you need

1486
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,359
to be looking at how can we improve

1487
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:55,859
because it's real easy to get

1488
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,060
overwhelmed and say I'm never going to

1489
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,220
get there but if you focus on how can I

1490
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,260
be better than yesterday you can make

1491
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,660
steps you can make progress and then the

1492
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,460
last thing is there you this is not a

1493
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,079
one-time thing you can't take a week off

1494
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:08,760
and go build this threat model

1495
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,319
and then you're done this is something

1496
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,060
that you constantly have to use review

1497
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,839
update

1498
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,500
last thing is be encouraged

1499
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,359
at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring

1500
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,099
the first movie

1501
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,140
Gandalf meets the balrog the balrog

1502
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,880
comes out in the minds of Moria and

1503
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,160
chases him off

1504
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,140
Gandalf stands in front of them big

1505
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,119
passionate moment and says You shall not

1506
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,380
pass

1507
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,200
and then they both die

1508
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,579
maybe that's not as encouraging as I

1509
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:40,020
thought it would be

1510
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,660
um hopefully you don't die but the thing

1511
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,220
is he puts it on the line he says this

1512
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,240
is where we're going to draw the line

1513
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,220
and this is what we're willing to do

1514
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,480
um

1515
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,400
I really do hope you don't die but if

1516
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,339
you do uh remember that it was for for a

1517
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:54,900
good cause right at least do it for a

1518
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,200
good cause

1519
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,680
I probably ought to find a better way to

1520
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,000
end that one

1521
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,740
um I think I'm out of time but do we

1522
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,220
have any questions

1523
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,319
I think you're gonna get like banned

1524
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,940
from wherever this gets posted for

1525
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,040
telling talking about dying probably

1526
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,599
probably it's not it's got to be better

1527
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:15,180
than the uh than the slideshow roulette

1528
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,940
last night and you you had a slide there

1529
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,220
were a couple of slides back where you

1530
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,160
had fail points and I I was thinking you

1531
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,839
might need do you need a trigger warning

1532
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,359
for imposter syndrome imposter syndrome

1533
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,240
probably this is this is like here if

1534
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,859
you have imposter syndrome here are your

1535
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:34,020
symptoms that you can choose from this

1536
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,900
is like a DSM for this that's true and

1537
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,640
and to be honest every one of these

1538
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,859
things are reasons that I've made a bad

1539
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:42,960
risk decision right like as I was

1540
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,040
thinking through of these I could

1541
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,359
probably do a whole talk just on the

1542
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,220
slide and point out all the places that

1543
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,440
I failed because I

1544
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,960
one reason or another

1545
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,000
so there we are and how many of us do

1546
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,920
not have a situation with one of these

1547
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,800
so if you feel imposter syndrome welcome

1548
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,119
to the club

1549
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,040
we're all we're all completely

1550
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,020
inadequate to the size of the job that

1551
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,300
needs to be done uh this which is why

1552
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,680
we're talking about mental health issues

1553
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,960
and that sort of thing so what time is

1554
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,460
it and when I'm supposed to know that

1555
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,380
are you done with that that's uh 251.

1556
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,060
all right I don't know who's next

1557
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,859
um Hector is

1558
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:18,960
awesome thank you everybody

1559
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,099
thank you all for coming
