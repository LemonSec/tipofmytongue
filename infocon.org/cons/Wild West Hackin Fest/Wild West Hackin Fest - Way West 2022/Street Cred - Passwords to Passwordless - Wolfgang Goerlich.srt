1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,960
all right uh our next talk is passwords

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,480
to password lists uh our presenter

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,900
Wolfgang is an advisory CSO for Cisco

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,360
secure he has been responsible for it

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,100
and I.T Security in the healthcare and

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,800
Financial Service sectors uh Wolfgang

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,380
has led

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,640
advisory and assessment practices for

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,460
cyber security consulting firms and uh

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,039
yeah so he likes a gesture see all

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,300
through that I was like how long am I

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,040
going to let him read out that very

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,739
boring bio Yeah we actually I had made

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,239
up another one for you but I wasn't sure

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,280
if we you should yeah this is this guy

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,059
he's an infosec he's a Tai Chi Master

17
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:43,680
superhero on the side and a you're not

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,700
supposed to say that one though right

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,739
it's like check out the glasses oh my

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,559
god I've been doxed okay so am I good

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,120
you're good I'm good all right let's go

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,500
thanks for coming out

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,559
uh so we're going to be talking about uh

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,180
credentials and moving away from the

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,280
shared secret that's the topic of the

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,500
day uh as I already mentioned I'm an

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,300
advisory C so some of this is Cecil

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,319
level right we'll get a little bit in

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,400
the weeds we'll get a little bit in the

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,720
weeds but it's not necessarily going to

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,460
be like oh by the way here's what you

32
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,740
should be configuring hashcad to run and

33
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,180
here's how you dump this up no this is

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,439
more of a defense it's more of a

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,479
configuration talk

36
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,280
and you know we've been having this

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,740
problem with credentials for a very long

38
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,840
time like right back to the early days

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,220
of hacking right back to the early days

40
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,320
of hacking this has been a problem

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,640
um early this is hacking like anyone

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,560
remember where like the word hacker gets

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,360
start from

44
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,939
like another one no

45
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,280
yes maybe people like I have no idea

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,400
like MIT right MIT model railroad way

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,259
back in the day so you could have yelled

48
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,740
that out this left me no just okay

49
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,119
that's fine what I thought was

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,979
interesting right so MIT railroad model

51
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,780
railroad was where the term hacking gets

52
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,520
started and what I really thought was

53
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,619
interesting was like hackers were now

54
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,799
disrupting train lines as part of uh

55
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,320
acts to sabotage Russians going after

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,259
Ukraine and I I'm not advocating hacking

57
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,880
I'm not advocating criminal hacking but

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,960
I thought that was really cool like it

59
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,659
was a cool tie-in like historically we

60
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,580
started off playing with model trains

61
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,160
and now we are wrecking real trains nice

62
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,700
Arc nice Arc but at MIT another thing

63
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,500
happened it was this guy this guy's the

64
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,620
IBM 7094 known for two things I'll tell

65
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,000
you one now I'll tell you the second one

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,580
later IBM 94 first thing it was known

67
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,700
for at MIT was being the very first

68
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,160
system to ever have a password

69
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,060
it's 1960s six decades ago

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,599
it's also the very first time there was

71
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,720
a password breach because within a very

72
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,280
short period of time of them putting in

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,080
a password to make sure that they're

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,459
having controls over this we had

75
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,599
accounting we know what students were

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,400
using it within a very short time people

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,440
were like okay that sucks we're gonna

78
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,700
take those passwords out I'm going to

79
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,220
print them somehow accidentally

80
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,800
accidentally the password file got

81
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,480
loaded up into the message of the day

82
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,160
file so whenever you logged in you get a

83
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,660
new message oh by the way someone else's

84
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,760
password is this right did not take long

85
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,920
it did not take long for passers to go

86
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,239
off the rails

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,000
but this started effectively this cat

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
and mouse this cat and mouse game that

89
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
we played for a long time we either

90
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,459
demand more of the machine or we demand

91
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,840
more of the human we either demand

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,659
people have more passwords frequently

93
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,120
change passwords rotated passwords all

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,099
this sort of stuff or or we're like you

95
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,599
know what probably the password

96
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,819
shouldn't be in clear text maybe we

97
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,140
shouldn't allow them to be load in the

98
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,400
message they file maybe we should

99
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,140
encrypt them okay that's cool and then

100
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,280
of course the minute you encrypt them

101
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,659
someone's like all right well when I can

102
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,280
get at those and I can figure out a way

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,480
to decrypt it okay if I want to move

104
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,280
into Shadow file okay you have it now I

105
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,900
can get it this way okay fine we'll move

106
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,580
it over here okay and now I can do this

107
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,640
and we've had this long long lived cat

108
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,920
and gay Mouse as adversar has been going

109
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,980
after credentials meanwhile always I was

110
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,599
asking more for the people

111
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,360
so what I want to look at today is where

112
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,700
we're going with passwordless getting

113
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,080
rid of this password that we've been

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,599
stuck with for 60 years why we can't get

115
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,159
rid of it all the way even though I wish

116
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,420
we could

117
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,500
um and then I'm going to talk a little

118
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,000
bit about risk-based authentication how

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,319
we're going to handle Biometrics and

120
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,239
these sort of things

121
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,480
so first off on the the nature of

122
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,280
passwords one more thing about passwords

123
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,899
I I find a little bit of a Nostalgia for

124
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,160
early passwords like if you think about

125
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
like the first time you created a

126
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,759
password you sit down you think about a

127
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,500
password you probably put some time in

128
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,620
it's not like spring 2022 right you put

129
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,759
a little bit of time in it what does

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
that mean what is this shared secret

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
that I'm going to tell the computer I

132
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,639
remember some like early jokes that I

133
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,680
used to use and those are great

134
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,419
um and then you get to your second and

135
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,620
your third and your fourth and then

136
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,820
you've been in the industry for a while

137
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,460
and no longer is it fun but isn't just

138
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,560
us who do that when we looked at someone

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,040
like the historical figures in Computing

140
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,840
and crack their passwords this was done

141
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,720
against the BSD backups recently like

142
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,240
Ken Thompson right Ken Thompson who

143
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,100
defines so much of the Unix thinking and

144
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,080
of course behind Google his password was

145
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,060
a chess move I like that that's cool

146
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,860
that's cool

147
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,020
um Eric Schmidt I'll get Google and

148
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,699
everything else his password was his

149
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,280
wife's name plus exclamation marks ahead

150
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,660
of his time we all know he had an

151
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,860
exclamation mark capacitor is more

152
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,780
secure much better much better with that

153
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,280
exclamation mark

154
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,259
so I like that right it's kind of sweet

155
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,300
it's kind of nice and I like some of

156
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,039
that Nostalgia like oh by the way you

157
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,020
know if you walk around you might see

158
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,940
people sticking sticky notes with

159
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,340
passwords I also like that idea it's

160
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,080
been a long time

161
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,620
since I did any sort of assessment when

162
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,940
I was a security officer I think it was

163
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,620
the last time maybe 10 15 years ago when

164
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,300
I walked around the look for sticky

165
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,620
notes but a long time since I actually

166
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,199
saw that in the wild anyone see like a

167
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,400
sticky note in the wild or the password

168
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,600
recently

169
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,160
a couple of people are like yeah we

170
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,720
still see that all the time okay you're

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,699
shooting my idea in the foot but I think

172
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,860
sometimes like there's too much to write

173
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,440
it down was that at home or was that an

174
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,460
office

175
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,259
oh now you're breaking my heart okay so

176
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,580
that's still a problem

177
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,039
so people are stupid with passwords we

178
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,180
pick things that are easy to remember

179
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,800
and so what are we going to do we're

180
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,759
going to demand more of the machine

181
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,380
we're going to add in multi-factor as we

182
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,360
already know uh any number of different

183
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,340
multi-factor options of course then

184
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,840
we've got additional problems with

185
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,419
multi-factor because as with any control

186
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,240
the minute it gets to a certain level of

187
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,020
uh maturity it's primed for being

188
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,039
attacked

189
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,660
I don't know what that maturity level is

190
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,639
I feel like it's like a third right like

191
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,919
if no one's doing it you're pretty good

192
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,840
the first people who block like zip

193
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,280
files on emails were gods among men like

194
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,139
no one can attack me because everyone's

195
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,580
sending a zip files

196
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,960
and then enough people are doing that

197
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,139
and we switch to ISO I'm like we stopped

198
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,360
them until they started doing IMG files

199
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,860
and so on and so forth but there's some

200
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,120
sort of threshold there when enough

201
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,340
people are using a control that suddenly

202
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,660
the adversaries are like you know what

203
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,639
I'm not gonna like ignore this anymore

204
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,139
I'm gonna actually spend some time and

205
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,340
I'm gonna go ahead and put a control

206
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,199
place and that's what we're seeing with

207
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,759
multi-factor today

208
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,759
so attacks like uh Sim swapping and

209
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,800
that's a seven attacks

210
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,479
Sim swapping of course pretty pretty

211
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,759
well known I walk into the store I

212
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,520
pretend that I'm you I asked for the

213
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,560
manager I say I lost my phone this sucks

214
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,020
like I should help you sir yes you

215
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,520
should because I need my phone

216
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,500
immediately can you at least give me a

217
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,240
new SIM card and give you a SIM card and

218
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,099
then you're suddenly that person

219
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,380
not something that we're going to deploy

220
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,539
against everybody I mean that's a pretty

221
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,400
manual effort some swapping attacks are

222
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,960
still a pretty new effort but something

223
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,000
we definitely see for high worth of

224
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,759
clients high value targets anyone who

225
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,139
has a lot of money in their crypto

226
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,599
wallet and is bragging about that money

227
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,660
and also has SMS as their multi-factor

228
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,800
so uh Sim swapping ss7 attacks again not

229
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,180
something where I see in Mass you gotta

230
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,400
actually take control of the cell tower

231
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,900
or convince people to join your cell

232
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,880
tower to do this

233
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,860
um not something you see very often I

234
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,060
think the last time I saw it I was in

235
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,800
the conference

236
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,539
um in Indianapolis I was actually with

237
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,880
my uh my wife right and so we're having

238
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,319
some coffee and we're having a good time

239
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,880
and she's like why is my phone look

240
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,860
weird and I pulled my phone like oh yeah

241
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,080
apparently we're in Shanghai

242
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,419
that's weird you turn off your phone

243
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,000
just shut it all down because they

244
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
convinced a bunch of people to d off in

245
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,379
the tower join their uh Micro Tower

246
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,840
MicroCell set up and uh of course we're

247
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,240
well positioned for ss7 texts so ss7

248
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,220
attacks are our thing if you have

249
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,139
physical access

250
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,060
um what else we got symmetra crypto

251
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,880
duplicate code generation uh golden saml

252
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,339
attacks that's fun so what happens once

253
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,039
you authenticate get past all the

254
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,020
authentication all together to get a

255
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,479
hold of a token then you can go ahead

256
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,799
and pass the token around as we've seen

257
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,240
curb us we're also seeing that in the

258
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,519
web World golden saml in particular we

259
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,140
saw

260
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,260
um cyber Arc founded I think in 2017 and

261
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,000
then we saw it in some recent attacks

262
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,220
like solar winds where you just go ahead

263
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,620
and get the certificate you print off as

264
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,360
many saml tickets as you want and then

265
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,440
you bypass all the MFA all together cool

266
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,899
and then push fishing where you get a

267
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,279
million and one push fishing I don't

268
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,899
know that we got a good name for this

269
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,360
I've heard Brute Force I've heard

270
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,160
fishing but basically just keep sending

271
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,140
someone attempt after attempt after

272
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,019
attempt until they finally say yes

273
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,060
which is really frustrating if you've

274
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,440
configured your environment to allow

275
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,080
like 100 people to send pushes to this

276
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,640
poor pathetic person who's just trying

277
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,500
to do their job no that's not me no

278
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,880
that's not me no that's still not me no

279
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,800
that's not me but I guess maybe it's me

280
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,720
and boom then they're in of course

281
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,540
ah and then proxy like evil engine X

282
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,820
which is really kind of clever I'm going

283
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,959
to convince someone that they're

284
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,700
actually authenticating into a valid

285
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,380
site and then still their username and

286
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,580
get them to do a push then in the

287
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,380
meantime I'm going to proxy that in and

288
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,779
log into them and use that push to or

289
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,540
that multi-factored Authentication

290
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,120
so we get a whole bunch of stuff so they

291
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,620
answer obviously as Biometrics like

292
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,820
we're talking about earlier in the last

293
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,920
session we'll just do fingerprint we'll

294
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,540
do facial recognition everything will be

295
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,040
great

296
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,959
except for

297
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,260
not because when you look at crossover

298
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,140
error rates and other things there's uh

299
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,260
a high likelihood that you can spoof

300
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,339
Biometrics as we see quite frequently

301
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,959
the Talos team did it uh what in 2020

302
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,399
which really I mean you had enough going

303
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,180
on 2020 why spend 2020 doing this but

304
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,060
they would take people's fingerprints 3D

305
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,640
print them and then use that to log into

306
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,080
devices

307
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,600
I thought that was fantastic right you

308
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,880
I'm going to rely on my Biometrics so

309
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,399
okay cool by the way thank you for

310
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,380
touching that glass now I 3D printed it

311
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,940
and now I'm logging your phone I love

312
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,220
that it's so like James Bond you know

313
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,779
Mission Impossible

314
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,459
love that idea

315
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:48,600
so

316
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,579
what are we doing for multi-factor is it

317
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,680
still good yeah yeah it's much better

318
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,720
nothing else is there a lot of attacks

319
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,300
coming out of it yes are a lot of these

320
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,180
attacks likely probably not I doubt many

321
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,040
of us are going to have our three uh

322
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,800
fingerprints 3D printed I doubt very

323
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,360
much that people are going to try to

324
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,760
steal our SIM cards I doubt very much

325
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,019
that people are going to take over our

326
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,300
Towers but of course these are attacks

327
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,760
we're all worried about so it's possible

328
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,360
yes is it likely not necessarily

329
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,399
so this gets us to pass or less all

330
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,959
right so now we're going to think about

331
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,399
how do we just get rid of that shared

332
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,320
secret all together how do we put in

333
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,600
place some good controls understanding

334
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,240
that the underlying uh multi-factor

335
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,120
stack as I mentioned is is under attack

336
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,920
so that deal with passwordless is we're

337
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,899
going to remove that shared Secret at

338
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,300
least remove it from the people who know

339
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,220
about it I'm not going to worry about a

340
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,480
chess move I'm not going to worry about

341
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,800
my wife's name I'm not going to worry

342
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,000
about the exclamation marks I'm going to

343
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,579
abstract all that I'll still need some

344
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:48,480
way

345
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
to identify myself to the the

346
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,860
application I still need some way to

347
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,540
authenticate and get in but I'm not

348
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,720
going to do it with a shared Factor

349
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,339
so

350
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,380
why now right we've been talking about

351
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,320
passwordless for for a while again 1960s

352
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,360
we're on a Mainframe and people are

353
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,980
already pissed off about passwords we've

354
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,480
had this problem for a very long time

355
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,899
why now in the early 2000s Bill Gates

356
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,120
stood on the RSA States and said we

357
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,820
shall kill the password in two years and

358
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,440
everybody cheered

359
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,620
and then we're now in 2022. so why why

360
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,480
now why why are we making some progress

361
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,279
well a couple things have changed

362
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,000
first off is enough people now have uh

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,820
mobile phones or other devices and

364
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,019
enough people are enrolled in

365
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,640
multi-factors so they've got a strong

366
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,620
way of authenticating right we we've

367
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,140
effectively given everybody a biometric

368
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,760
sensor that they're carrying around I

369
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,959
say everybody I'll come back to that

370
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,019
because of course it's not everybody

371
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:48,360
secondly we've gotten a good standard so

372
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,899
Fido which does the you know UTF and the

373
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,180
Yuba key have come up with 502 standard

374
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,260
which I'll talk about in this talk a

375
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,880
little bit and the final two standard

376
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,959
allows us to do passwordless

377
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,180
authentication with applications so

378
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,800
we've got a good standard we've got the

379
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,180
good infrastructure we've got the good

380
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,100
capability to move forward now it's just

381
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,360
a matter of making sure enough people

382
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,800
adopt it

383
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,000
so that is the overall idea however

384
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,440
we can poke a lot of holes in that

385
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,860
pretty quickly

386
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,899
first off I'm not about to stand on the

387
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,160
stage and say passwords would be dead in

388
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,120
two years

389
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,399
I wish I could I wish I could but I talk

390
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,600
about password I'm like this is what it

391
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
is and like that's great our Workforce

392
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,519
is hourly we don't even give them email

393
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,440
addresses like what do you what do you

394
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,079
mean that's great but we've got a whole

395
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,940
bunch of workers that don't necessarily

396
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,740
have phones we can't require them to log

397
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,480
in with their phones but what do you

398
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,519
mean passwords are going to be dead

399
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,860
that's great but my applications don't

400
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,660
even support Samuel yet and Sam has been

401
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,579
a standard for 10 years

402
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,019
okay

403
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,660
so we have some problems there this is

404
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,700
the the reality this is what makes it

405
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,620
possible but we do have some problems

406
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,720
with application vendors picking up the

407
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,760
standard and supporting it even though

408
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,740
major manufacturers like apple and

409
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,079
Microsoft and Google all support it from

410
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,940
the browser level we have some problems

411
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,579
with the reality of how many people the

412
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,440
workforce would have the ability to do

413
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,120
strong Factor authentication without

414
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,399
providing keys and whatnot because again

415
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,839
in a lot of environments we can't

416
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,060
require people to have smartphones or

417
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,220
user smartphones in the job

418
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,660
so there's some things that are going to

419
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,399
hold this up a little bit

420
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,120
but it's a good good place to start so

421
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,459
if we can get to passwordless for the

422
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,839
people we can get to passwordless for

423
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,120
the haves not to have knots for the the

424
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,920
situation where I've got someone who's

425
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,240
got a smartphone who's got an

426
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,680
application stacked that support that

427
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,540
have everything in place we can finally

428
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,699
actually improve security while

429
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,139
improving usability which is something

430
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,420
we never get to do very rarely in the

431
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,920
security team do you get to show up and

432
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,060
be like hey

433
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,220
I'm here to make your life easier

434
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,019
as a matter of fact I suppose if you

435
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,519
showed up and said that

436
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,260
they wouldn't believe you and they would

437
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,579
probably walk away very quickly

438
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,860
that may be born partially out of

439
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,300
personal experience I'm here to make

440
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,459
your job better come back no I mean it

441
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,500
this time right very rarely do we get to

442
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,480
actually improve Things From reusability

443
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,339
perspective which is why I'm excited

444
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,139
about this technology stack so how we're

445
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,579
going to get there some of the steps

446
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,839
along the way that I'll talk about for

447
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,120
the next about half hour or so is

448
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,120
looking at the multi-factor side of IT

449
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,680
consulting authentication workflows so

450
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,260
we can make things easier that way and

451
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,639
then looking at the trust side we

452
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,660
already know we're going to have some

453
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,339
problems with the different factors that

454
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,139
people are logging in on how can we

455
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,860
increase trust in the system

456
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,000
moving those things to the passwordless

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
and then optimizing for the overall tool

458
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,959
set that's the general path that we're

459
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,779
going to take in our time together

460
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,519
all right from a multi-factor

461
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,920
perspective so at its core at its core

462
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,420
what we're doing with passwordless is

463
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,740
we're taking a password plus a

464
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,480
multi-factor and then we're removing

465
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,279
that password right at its core from a

466
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,660
user perspective that's what we're doing

467
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,240
on the backend perspective we're

468
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,880
replacing that password if we're doing

469
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,220
it with the 502 perspective we're

470
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,519
replacing that password still with uh a

471
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,440
secret but song or shared secret it's a

472
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
derived secret based on the biometric so

473
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,760
I log in with my biometric into my

474
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,940
device my device opens up uh the secure

475
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,320
Enclave the secure Enclave that's the

476
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
key Material Exchange happens and I'm

477
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,920
able to log into a device or an

478
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,380
application so that's what we're doing

479
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,800
on the website on the

480
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,660
um Windows side we're effectively doing

481
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,940
is we're logging in and we're using

482
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,620
certificate-based authentication log

483
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,060
into Windows environment so we're still

484
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,380
getting a Kerberos we're still getting

485
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,139
our ntl mv2 hashes except for it's not

486
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,880
having shared secret material anymore

487
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,920
now it's having

488
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,720
um you know pki certificate based on

489
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,220
Authentication

490
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,620
so we take the password we get rid of

491
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,839
the password we already know as I

492
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,040
mentioned earlier there's a lot of

493
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,259
problems with a lot of these factors so

494
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,699
right away what we want to do is start

495
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,560
removing some of those factors from play

496
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,300
we're probably not going to want to do

497
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,480
SMS based multi-factor we're probably

498
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,600
not going to want to do email based uh

499
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,640
multi-factor we're probably not going to

500
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,559
want to do some of those ones that are

501
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,140
really well known to be attacked for the

502
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,760
things that remain things like push and

503
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,900
whatnot we're going to want to put in

504
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,240
place good controls to prevent people

505
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,359
from doing the proxying or doing the

506
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,160
Brute Force we send a bunch of requests

507
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,140
in so we want to bolster those remaining

508
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,579
factors

509
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,500
from there when we authenticate in

510
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,119
effectively looks something like this

511
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,160
right if I log in we know this today

512
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,440
username and password I'm in

513
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,960
we take away the password so now we've

514
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,400
got to pass through this authentication

515
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,200
we run into our next problem that we're

516
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,380
going to run into which seems to be on

517
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,500
the rise with technical Innovation

518
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,100
um

519
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,200
compliance right a lot of compliance

520
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,059
standards aren't necessarily geared

521
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,299
towards what we do as just like a side

522
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,580
note uh inventory is a good one right

523
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,220
that should have a fantastic inventory

524
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,080
that is maintained and blessed and

525
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,940
everything is checked in and checked

526
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,200
every three months sounds like a great

527
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,360
control incompliance Savage awesome

528
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,460
let's do it okay then you go to do it in

529
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,900
your SAS applications and your devops

530
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,820
were like uh does that mean I have to

531
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,500
maintain my instances for three months

532
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,179
because I usually spin them up and spin

533
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,620
them down a couple days sometimes a

534
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,880
couple weeks why are we maintaining

535
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,620
these things as long

536
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,080
you look at things like oh Thou shalt

537
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,780
bless and do access reviews

538
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,520
great and then you look at the managers

539
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
and like yeah we're asked to do that

540
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,240
every three months and we just click yes

541
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,059
to everything great control

542
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,220
also what happens with gig workers don't

543
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,780
worry about that we're about scope them

544
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,000
okay great control compliance oftentimes

545
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,720
as we all know is not exactly aligned

546
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,280
with what we're trying to do

547
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,260
so from a multi-factor perspective

548
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,660
what's interesting is organizations have

549
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,700
adopted passwordless early are like okay

550
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,559
that's great but you still have to do

551
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,260
multi-factor and you tell that well I

552
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,520
mean the weakest factor is the password

553
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,799
okay I get that but now you only have

554
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,240
one factor students still need to do

555
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,160
multi-factor to be compliant

556
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,799
all right so what we need to start

557
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,020
thinking about is how to do multi-factor

558
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,760
with a passwordless workflow so it

559
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,340
really is two factors to do the

560
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,140
authentication

561
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,120
um and we can do that with things like

562
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,940
uh biometric into your phone and then do

563
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,919
the Second Step into the application

564
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,419
it's one way to do it you can do things

565
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,820
like biometric in your phone plus a Yuba

566
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,740
key there's different ways to combine

567
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,960
those things with the overall ideas have

568
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
still two factors so when you're

569
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
authenticating in you can still meet the

570
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,299
compliance requirement as well as

571
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,160
mitigate some of the risk of any one of

572
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,419
those factors getting compromised

573
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,200
all right and do it in one step why not

574
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,000
as again from the user perspective the

575
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,200
main benefit here is usability

576
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,940
okay from a Fido perspective this

577
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,240
four-way main use cases from Fido first

578
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,620
one is exactly what we've been talking

579
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,500
about I use my device to log in to an

580
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,200
application I open it up there's a

581
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
challenge response the challenge uh is

582
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,960
sent the key material is exchanged I am

583
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,520
able to authenticate it's not shared

584
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
secret also what's kind of cool about

585
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,100
that is

586
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,620
it is looking at the URL

587
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,480
when it's doing that process from the

588
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,919
502 perspective so if you think about

589
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,780
most fishing which is I sent you an

590
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,120
email it's got a quirky URL I click you

591
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,280
to trick you to link on it I click on

592
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,200
that link and I'll give you my creds now

593
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,480
we're in that type of workflow is

594
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,820
predicated on of course having a URL

595
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,740
that does not match what the user is

596
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,020
expecting So within Fido they

597
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,700
automatically do that checking for you

598
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,200
before they exchange the key material

599
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,240
pretty cool reduces an Avenue of

600
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,340
phishing the Fido people say this will

601
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,100
completely stop fishing I will say that

602
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,440
if enough people are using it all the

603
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,380
other Fishers will find other avenues of

604
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,360
bypass your security because the fishing

605
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,940
people are not going to give up but four

606
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,880
one very well known very used factor of

607
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,640
fishing that eliminates it

608
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,240
one of the problems with this is

609
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,660
um it it is predicated on a user and

610
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,539
device to application model so if I've

611
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,059
just got me and my device to

612
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,620
authenticate that's fine what happens if

613
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,840
I switch to another device what happens

614
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,580
if I'm using that device for multiple

615
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,860
companies again like the gig worker use

616
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,160
cases what happens if I've got a shared

617
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,419
computer that multiple people are

618
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,700
authenticating to so I think call

619
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,520
centers think healthcare where people

620
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,020
are just walking up to a terminal and

621
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,299
using it those types of use cases in

622
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,039
those scenarios it doesn't necessarily

623
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,419
work because they're not going to want

624
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,000
to enroll everyone's Biometrics and

625
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,860
everyone's data into one device and be

626
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,600
able to share it out so the next way

627
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,960
that 502 allows is effectively for a

628
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
bound external authenticator so this

629
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,120
would be similarly to like a UTF token

630
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,919
so you can imagine I've got my token I

631
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,419
walk up I set my token down on the

632
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,220
reader and I use that to go ahead and

633
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,679
authenticate and get it so now I can

634
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,480
work around multiple devices I can have

635
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,120
one key to log into everything and I can

636
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,240
use that along with the 502 protocol to

637
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,220
complete the Authentication

638
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,539
so

639
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,240
found external authenticator another way

640
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,760
of doing this is roaming external

641
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,039
authenticator so if you don't

642
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,539
necessarily want to bind it but you

643
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,159
again have one of these use cases where

644
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,900
you've got multiple different devices or

645
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,539
shared devices

646
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,840
using a that method now with all three

647
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,740
of these

648
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,419
we're sending all the data through the

649
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:28,679
front Channel

650
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,080
so when I'm doing this authentication

651
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,299
web authentic is doing its flow to

652
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,280
authenticate me in

653
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,200
um be it either something that's bound

654
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,120
to the device with ctap or something

655
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,880
that I'm carrying that's uh roaming

656
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,799
challenge here is a couple things one

657
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,020
front end as we know from looking at

658
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,440
saml oauth ODC front end is oftentimes

659
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,000
at risk because it's going through the

660
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,440
browsers going through the device if

661
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,260
there's an adversary that's doing a man

662
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,240
in the middle or a man in the browser

663
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,280
attack we can have some risks there

664
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,799
another concern with this of course is

665
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,600
that means that application has to

666
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,659
support uh web authentic to support 502

667
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,159
I mentioned earlier a lot of things

668
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,320
still don't support saml the uptick in

669
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,740
these things can be really a problem

670
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,880
so the final mode that's uh evolving is

671
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,179
using this on the back end

672
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,659
um to do the access devices so the

673
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,280
person goes and authenticates the

674
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,140
application stack the application stack

675
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,059
this is usually an SSL portal or

676
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:32,900
something else goes and does the 502

677
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,940
exchange with a remote or roaming

678
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,559
authenticator so this will be something

679
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,240
like push or something else so I'd open

680
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,039
up my application the application stack

681
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,360
on the back channel would handle that

682
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,640
and I'd complete my off

683
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,760
so those are four main patterns that 502

684
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,640
is is looking at the first one again is

685
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,380
predominantly a consumer-based pattern

686
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,020
it's my device I've got my biometric on

687
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,700
it it doesn't leave my hands it only

688
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,559
goes to the the things I've enrolled it

689
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,020
on the last one is emerging more as the

690
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,918
workforce pattern

691
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,080
so from an authentication perspective we

692
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,539
do that username and password we add the

693
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,760
MFA and we get that MFA enrolled and we

694
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,140
get it in the state where enough people

695
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,820
have that multi-factor so that we can

696
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,620
start removing the password that's step

697
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,960
one of this process

698
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,860
another risk to consider here is

699
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,320
ensuring that we don't open up potential

700
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,500
Avenues through downshifting of factors

701
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,320
or through recovery effectors so if

702
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,640
enough people are doing this what are

703
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,900
the adversaries going to do well we've

704
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,140
seen people go through and

705
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,880
um you know for a long time downshift

706
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,760
protocols right downshift methods so if

707
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,200
I allow Sim and I allow biometric and

708
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,760
both are enrolled well why am I not

709
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,700
going to just use the Sim attack from an

710
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,919
adversary perspective

711
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,240
so we want to make sure that doesn't

712
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,039
happen in addition the enrollment side

713
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,140
is really important if so if you look at

714
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,240
like the solarwinds attack again is

715
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,039
really instrumental with this one of the

716
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,179
ways they caught it of course was

717
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,940
someone enrolled a factor on that user

718
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,440
and then when that was identified that

719
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,000
was alerted and they went and

720
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,500
investigated it

721
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,440
so how people are able to do identity

722
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,100
proofing and recovery and roll devices

723
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,260
will oftentimes set the floor of the

724
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,640
security model

725
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,320
it's no problem I've got the greatest

726
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,120
factors in the world okay I've lost it

727
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,500
and I call the help desk and they say

728
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,299
okay what's your employee number I get

729
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,620
my employee number they say what's the

730
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,940
name of your dog I give the name of the

731
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,159
dog all right sir we reset you go ahead

732
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,260
and add whatever device you want

733
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,240
that's going to be the primary factor

734
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,320
that gets attacked with us

735
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,640
and I already mentioned the downshifting

736
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,059
Factor so just click through those all

737
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,860
right the next step we need to do is

738
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,380
think about not only fewer passwords

739
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,500
um but also fewer auths so think about

740
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,360
consoling the workflows four

741
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,700
applications that do support that SSO

742
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,380
process for applications that do support

743
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,320
xaml let's bring them on into one portal

744
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,240
so we have one place to configure as

745
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,500
opposed to going to each one of those

746
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,779
applications and configure it out

747
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,580
it's one of the reasons why I think that

748
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,340
I don't see the the sticky note problem

749
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,720
anymore I know you guys said you still

750
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,779
see it I don't find it very often uh I

751
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:19,740
think part of the problem is there's

752
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,960
just too many sticky notes there's just

753
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,600
too many damn passwords we got a trace

754
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,940
the stats show 191 passwords at the

755
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,460
moment is the the normal uh for the

756
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,320
workforce I think I'm around like 400

757
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,299
last time I checked you know somewhere

758
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,220
within there is where we all exist so

759
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,539
trying to keep track of that of course

760
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,760
is a significant problem as well as

761
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,799
that's what leads people to do reuse

762
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,799
that leads to compromise of any one pass

763
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,299
being passed over

764
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,980
etc etc

765
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,140
so what we want to do at this stage is

766
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,440
effectively move in as many of the

767
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,320
applications into a Federated model

768
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,179
through saml through oauth through IDC

769
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,640
move them in and do that passwordless

770
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,360
authentication into that SSL portal so

771
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,100
configure it once and then that would

772
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,159
apply to everything else Downstream

773
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,720
particularly good when you think about

774
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,640
how many applications Enterprises have

775
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,840
you know 1400 is the the stat I've seen

776
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,679
particularly good we start thinking

777
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,020
about all the application endpoints too

778
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,200
like I there's a study that showed up

779
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,900
there's over 15 000 API endpoints per

780
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,120
organization I thought that was just

781
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,200
absolutely incredibly crazy

782
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,240
so are we doing authentication are those

783
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,340
oh sure of course we are absolutely we

784
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,039
are absolutely we are

785
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,960
I was going back and forth with a guy on

786
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,220
on Twitter about this he's like there's

787
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,779
no way that I have that many API

788
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:43,980
endpoints going oh that's fine that's

789
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,140
what the stat shows he goes that means

790
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,580
that I'm probably missing like 10 000

791
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,919
APM points like yes yes it does and you

792
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,480
probably are I started thinking about

793
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,720
like when I was doing application uh

794
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,240
inventories early on I thought I had

795
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,400
like 200 like I've got 200 Business apps

796
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,659
that's what I've shown the spreadsheet

797
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,820
that makes sense and I put up a casby

798
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,240
and it was like 1500 right you put out

799
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,100
something that shows how many devices

800
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,960
are attaching to your application you

801
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,000
think you have probably two devices per

802
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,460
user you got the corporate device they

803
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,380
got their BYOD foam probably about two

804
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,080
and invariably it's like 10 000 more

805
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
devices than we know so I wouldn't be

806
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,919
necessarily surprised if we don't have

807
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,799
the same problem in the API stack why

808
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,980
that's an issue is because if we've got

809
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,260
an API that's configured where we can

810
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,059
just accept a username and password get

811
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,980
a token back we can then pass that token

812
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,200
around and authenticated other things

813
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,039
we saw this happen with

814
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,919
o365 I want to say three four years ago

815
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,500
they're able to authenticate in

816
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,260
get a token even if the user had MFA

817
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,059
enabled because of some of the Legacy

818
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,860
protocols pass that in then to

819
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,260
SharePoint and other services that we're

820
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,960
checking the MFA and you know we're

821
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,419
fully authenticated by bypassing it so

822
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:04,919
we've got to get a good inventory of

823
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,419
these applications we've got a good

824
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,539
inventory of the API points because

825
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,620
that's where people are going to work

826
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,120
around this

827
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,380
the other problem we're going to run

828
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,559
into at this stage is any Legacy stuff

829
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,200
so I talked to Banks Banks are like oh

830
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,580
yeah it's great that makes perfect sense

831
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,460
yeah so how do I do it for rack F like

832
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,500
uh

833
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,200
um you you don't right now because

834
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,419
mainframes are not going to support it

835
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,399
and they probably won't for any period

836
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,380
of time is there any like path to get

837
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,120
off the Mainframe like yeah in 10 years

838
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,059
I'm like okay all right cool cool

839
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:41,820
ah so the idea of like application

840
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,399
access proxies and auth proxies becomes

841
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,260
very important in these Legacy use cases

842
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,240
and again for a lot of Industries they

843
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,539
have tons of Legacy use cases so I'd

844
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,220
love to stand on a stage and say the

845
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,080
password is going to be dead in two

846
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,179
years but the reality is we're going to

847
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,559
be continuing to run into Legacy

848
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,980
protocols unprotected apis unknown

849
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,200
applications and these are the main gaps

850
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,880
that adversaries are going to use to

851
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,919
work around the solution these are also

852
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,419
the main gaps that are going to prevent

853
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,279
us from going full-on password

854
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,260
so probably be in a hybrid environment

855
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,640
for some time

856
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,559
but as much as possible we can identify

857
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,840
them bring them in integrate them

858
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,760
um with things like salmon oethanol you

859
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,919
see we could be in a good point as long

860
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,919
as again those integration points are

861
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,720
enforcing pass or less than allowing

862
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,919
allowing us to bypass it

863
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,020
all right so now we got someone logging

864
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,799
in

865
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,799
to something we know that's modern we're

866
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,419
going to have some environment that's

867
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,100
out of scope some exceptions but

868
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,899
something that login that's modern

869
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,299
they're connecting up

870
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:47,760
um and they're going in and opening

871
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,320
these applications at that point in time

872
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,539
we need to start thinking about

873
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:54,059
what additional things could we miss

874
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,980
what additional vectors could criminals

875
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,140
use to get in what additional ways could

876
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,120
they bypass the factors one of the

877
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,500
things I think is really intriguing

878
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,460
about 502 is it really takes the

879
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,260
effectively zero trust approach where

880
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,940
they say okay it's not just a user

881
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,320
logging in but it's a user logging on

882
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,539
the device now that can be a big problem

883
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,539
as I mentioned earlier if it's just

884
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,820
one user on one device in the consumer

885
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,240
use case but that mapping of these are

886
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,159
the devices we expect a person to come

887
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,500
into and this is what they're coming in

888
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,559
from is pretty pretty rigorous from a

889
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,940
security property because it reduces our

890
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,980
attack surface right it can't just be

891
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,899
someone in another country and another

892
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,820
computer with a stone cred getting in it

893
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,700
has to be one of the devices we expect

894
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,880
foreign

895
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,320
identity becomes important

896
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,059
the other thing that becomes important

897
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,360
is what happens once they're in just in

898
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,760
case we've got some residual problems so

899
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,380
the very first thing we need to do is

900
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,260
make sure that we've got really good

901
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,679
device identities that could be through

902
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,840
cert based authentication mechanisms

903
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,220
that could be agent-based some

904
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,340
mechanisms cert bases of course really

905
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,240
good strong properties we can trust pki

906
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,039
as long as we've got good PKA management

907
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,740
and that can't be bypassed see also what

908
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,539
I was saying about the golden saml

909
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,520
assert problem where if they could get

910
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,220
at that certificate that was being used

911
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,200
by adfs they could just keep printing

912
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,940
out saml assertions if we can get at the

913
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,039
certs obviously that undermines the

914
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,059
whole thing but if we've got good cert

915
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,279
management cert management is the way to

916
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,059
go

917
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,640
if not then that's when we're looking at

918
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,679
things like agents if we can put agents

919
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,779
in place on the devices

920
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,880
um if it's BYOD there may be some

921
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,159
pushback on that we may have some

922
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,899
ramifications to deal with on that side

923
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,580
but different ways of authenticating

924
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,200
those devices and then pairing in the

925
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,500
back end that device with the user

926
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,120
the next thing is to make sure that the

927
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,559
device is really up to date again

928
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,480
thinking about the attack surface how do

929
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,580
we control that how do we make sure that

930
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,860
it is a pretty restricted environment

931
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,440
that's patched that we've got a password

932
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,380
on it that firewall is on it that's not

933
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,779
jailbroken all those side of things

934
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,940
in addition to that

935
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,679
one of the things I think is is

936
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,380
important on the side of things is if we

937
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,600
imagine a world where everyone is using

938
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,640
passwordless and everyone is using a

939
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,260
protected device we imagine that world

940
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,019
and the adversary cannot possibly log in

941
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:25,320
from any other device as that person

942
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,940
the next thing we're going to do is try

943
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,440
and convince that user to install some

944
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,760
software in the box and wait till they

945
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,320
log in and follow that trusted session

946
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,940
that type of remote attack that we see

947
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,919
so often in the consumer space right now

948
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,140
where people are just oh we you know

949
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,720
it's John Doe from Microsoft support

950
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,519
please click on this link I'm here to

951
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,840
protect you and they click on the link

952
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,279
and now they're in their environment and

953
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,899
logging into whatever they want to log

954
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,380
into that type of attack path is what

955
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,820
we'll start singing more and more of so

956
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,279
we want so want to make sure that the

957
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,320
computer isn't infected right that it's

958
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,840
integrated with the AV or the EDR it's

959
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,700
making sure that the computer is in no

960
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,200
good state

961
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,080
so basic checks do the basic fundamental

962
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,599
checks the if this then that checks to

963
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,399
rule out any risk and make sure that

964
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,619
we've got really good understanding of

965
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,300
that device and the device is hardened

966
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,159
and everything else

967
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,560
from there then we can go ahead and do

968
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,719
something a little more interesting we

969
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,179
can go ahead and look at some of the

970
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,139
patterns and behaviors

971
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,699
I mentioned that this was this computer

972
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,480
the IBM 7094 was uh famous for two

973
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,280
reasons one of them was the passwords

974
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,659
and of course the very first password

975
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,060
breach camping on this device the other

976
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,580
one was if you're a fan of sci-fi if you

977
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,739
think about like the 2001 Space Odyssey

978
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,418
right it's terribly old movie at this

979
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,820
point but if you think about how when

980
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,639
Hal gets unplugged he sings Daisy right

981
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,780
he sings Daisy and then slowly gets uh

982
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,000
taken offline seems weird doesn't it

983
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,099
Daisy why is he saying daisy very

984
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,640
strange little uh little bit of Cinema

985
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,380
I was like why is that well the reason

986
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,460
that was was when uh they were writing

987
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,020
the book when Arthur Seacock was writing

988
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,720
the book he was touring computers uh he

989
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,040
was trying to get a better understanding

990
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,260
of it and IBM took him aside and showed

991
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,660
him the IBM 7094 one of their demos at

992
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,040
the time to show how cool this computer

993
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,700
was was to sing daisy so Arthur C Clarke

994
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,839
is there and here's the computer and

995
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:26,220
it's singing Daisy he's like oh that's

996
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,020
good I should I should definitely use

997
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,119
that that's that's going in my book

998
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,820
Because by 2001 we'll be done with

999
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,220
passwords and we'll have ai that can

1000
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,400
sing to us this is the future

1001
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,740
I bring this up because I a I think it's

1002
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,960
kind of interesting way that you know

1003
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,359
Computing influences sci-fi and vice

1004
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,880
versa but B because for a long time we

1005
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,099
thought of AI as being super intelligent

1006
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,260
super smart right we thought of AI as

1007
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,359
being like the rosy robot the robot that

1008
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,099
could do anything that's sassy and can

1009
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:57,900
cook and can clean and push around a

1010
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,980
vacuum cleaner and balance our

1011
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,500
checkbooks and everything else and it's

1012
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,240
that mentality I think that oftentimes

1013
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,220
gets us in trouble with ueba and with

1014
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,680
um ML and AI because we're like all

1015
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,000
right if this mlna I should be able to

1016
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,560
think and identify and do all this sort

1017
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,240
of stuff and we're very frustrated when

1018
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,579
it doesn't also these models if we feed

1019
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,640
them too much data don't necessarily

1020
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,740
hold up to lots of changes in the

1021
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,760
environment

1022
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,760
when uh when 2020 happened and everyone

1023
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,099
went home I started reaching out to a

1024
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,599
couple people who I knew had really good

1025
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,240
uaba I'm like I know you spent like two

1026
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,220
years setting this up I know you spent

1027
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,119
like lots of time tuning it what happens

1028
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,560
to your model that took you two years to

1029
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,839
tune when everyone changes how they work

1030
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,460
in a month

1031
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,320
and my favorite quote of that was a

1032
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,640
friend of mine was a c so he goes yeah

1033
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,200
this was a spring when the robots went

1034
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,140
insane like what he goes yeah I just

1035
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,680
went insane so flooded our our Sim

1036
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,480
flooded us with alerts we unplugged it

1037
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,800
we turned it off we're gonna wait till

1038
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,540
everything settles and we tune it

1039
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,940
because we threw way too much data at

1040
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,960
this thing right it was trying to

1041
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,700
predict all of human behavior why

1042
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,020
because that's how we think about AI

1043
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,339
That's how we think about just have it

1044
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,480
do everything

1045
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,640
by contrast I think we're starting to

1046
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,880
see really good successes with ML

1047
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,040
detection is not with the Roses but with

1048
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,260
the roombas with the very purpose-built

1049
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,960
very specific systems they're looking at

1050
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,420
a very small set of data after we've

1051
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,060
weeded out what we know the known bad

1052
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,940
detections

1053
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,000
and when we look at them from the

1054
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,500
perspective of passwordless

1055
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,780
authentication you know we can start

1056
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,520
looking at things like how do we get

1057
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,500
Goodwill to find results what is going

1058
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,820
to look like where people normally log

1059
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,440
in what's a normal pattern what

1060
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,660
applications they launch what is their

1061
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,660
device State ordinary look like well you

1062
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,119
get much better data because it's a

1063
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,800
smaller training set and that training

1064
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,320
set doesn't change as frequently

1065
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,200
and then when we act on it when we act

1066
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,260
on it we can do better analytics right

1067
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,320
because with AI models oftentimes is

1068
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,119
very difficult with a high Avail of

1069
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,520
variability of it to really good ground

1070
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,040
truth this was clearly an adversary or

1071
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,260
to go back to my picture example those

1072
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,240
are clearly cupcakes but that's sushi

1073
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,420
right I want a cake so I guess Sushi is

1074
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,740
okay

1075
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,260
um actually now I want sushi never mind

1076
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,520
I'd probably end up searching on

1077
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,800
something different

1078
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,780
but the point is it gets you close but

1079
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,220
not all the way right it's very

1080
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,960
difficult to get to ground truth of

1081
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,940
these sort of things so what we want to

1082
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,180
do is feed this back into the system so

1083
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,040
we can investigate it but have very few

1084
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,320
false positives and act on them one

1085
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,579
accordingly we want to make sure that

1086
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,260
I'm not overrunning our Sim which

1087
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,000
already is getting tens of the thousands

1088
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,220
of words a day we also want to make sure

1089
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,440
that it's really really high quality

1090
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,480
data so we're not creating a denial of

1091
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,700
service condition by security

1092
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,980
I think we can get that but we got a

1093
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,839
limited set of data and if it's acting

1094
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,900
again after we've already ruled out what

1095
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,079
we know is bad if we can eliminate all

1096
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,940
the hey I shouldn't have a jailbroken

1097
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,420
phone I should be running Windows 7.

1098
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,099
I shouldn't have malware on my endpoint

1099
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,960
if we can eliminate all that before we

1100
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,260
feed the resulting data into the set we

1101
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,300
can have a much better analysis and then

1102
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,740
feed that back in determine whether or

1103
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,280
not we're going to allow the user in

1104
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,880
so that is the idea with applying ml to

1105
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,400
increase trust in our authentication

1106
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,880
models

1107
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,320
bottom line at this stages we don't

1108
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,260
necessarily need uh roses we need

1109
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,000
roombas we need something purpose built

1110
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,820
minimum viable looking at the data and

1111
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,400
taking out any residual trust that we

1112
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,260
have to make sure that we don't have to

1113
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,579
worry about things like stolen

1114
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:53,040
Biometrics or forged fingerprints or for

1115
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,839
its facial recognition all that sort of

1116
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,900
thing

1117
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,160
from there we can go ahead and start

1118
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,500
plugging the stack into the rest of our

1119
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,020
applications again being cognizant of

1120
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,060
all the things I mentioned up earlier

1121
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,160
what part of our user population is not

1122
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,079
going to be able to support this what

1123
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,060
part of our Tech stack is not going to

1124
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,500
be able to support it because it doesn't

1125
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,960
support the 502 standard or single

1126
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,820
sign-on standards what part of our Tech

1127
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,720
stack would not be able to support

1128
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,200
because the legacy on Mainframe or what

1129
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,599
have you once we identify what can

1130
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,280
support we can go ahead and move that

1131
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,579
into the passwordless use case

1132
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:32,520
and eliminate that password provide a

1133
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,400
better user experience and and doing so

1134
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,040
of course get users to move forward with

1135
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,440
a lot of these ideas about increasing

1136
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,579
trust and Authentication

1137
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,780
so I talk about increasing trust and

1138
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,099
authentication when talk about the

1139
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:48,599
overall stack it has to be more than the

1140
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,460
protocol we know the protocol is good we

1141
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,079
know that works we know that the device

1142
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,200
is good TPMS haven't necessarily been

1143
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,000
breached in any meaningful way yes

1144
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,320
there's been a couple attacks I know

1145
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,359
that but haven't been breached in any

1146
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,339
meaningful way for storing that key

1147
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:03,960
material secure Enclave in the Apple

1148
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,420
device is similar so we know that the

1149
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,940
underlying protocol is good we know the

1150
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,520
underlying Hardware is good now we just

1151
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,079
need to open it up a little bit and

1152
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,300
think about what other Tac vectors

1153
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,760
adversaries may use to close those loops

1154
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,500
and then we go ahead pick our use cases

1155
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,940
rinse and repeat it becomes a

1156
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,260
transformation effort it becomes a

1157
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,000
project becomes everything that we're

1158
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,740
good at doing in I.T we figure out where

1159
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,359
we're moving we move it we make sure the

1160
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,920
users are happy we move on to the next

1161
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,839
one doing it by business unit or doing

1162
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,200
it by working group or what have you

1163
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,700
of course if we're moving a whole bunch

1164
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,760
of these things in the other risk to to

1165
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,900
be aware of from an Enterprise

1166
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,480
perspective is there's a lot of

1167
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,619
different companies solving this

1168
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,560
different ways so one of the challenges

1169
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,599
is going to be making sure that we don't

1170
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,359
end up with a very heavy Tech stack with

1171
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,140
multiple different vendors to maintain

1172
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,500
did a study on vendors in downtime a few

1173
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,599
years ago I think this was late 2019

1174
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,880
early 2020. and one of the things I

1175
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,200
found interesting was is that

1176
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,079
organizations with the most vendors had

1177
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,599
the highest amount of impact right so

1178
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,000
average went from four hours to more

1179
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,619
than 17 hours if they had more than 50

1180
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,720
vendors and at first this was weird to

1181
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,859
me this didn't seem right to me this

1182
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:22,320
didn't feel right like no if I if I'm a

1183
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,540
c-zone I've got 50 tools I should be

1184
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,920
able to get up faster than the guy who

1185
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,300
only has a couple this doesn't seem

1186
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,020
right

1187
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,000
but then I remember one time I had this

1188
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,940
uh I had this outage and I called the

1189
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,220
guys into my office and I'm like go

1190
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,900
figure out what's going on you know are

1191
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,640
we under attack is there an outage was

1192
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,380
is something misconfigured and they all

1193
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,560
ran they all came back an hour later and

1194
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,940
the networking guys like I know what the

1195
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,859
problem is got a problem on the

1196
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,260
Switchback plane clearly it's a

1197
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,119
bandwidth issue there's an issue there

1198
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,260
that's that's the problem we're going

1199
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,300
that's that could be we've said before

1200
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,720
talk to the uh server guys like yeah we

1201
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,400
looked at our virtualization stack we're

1202
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,500
not getting the i o and the the CPU

1203
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,359
throughput so clearly the problem is

1204
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,940
there must be a bug in in uh the way

1205
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,859
that our hypervisors are working

1206
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,440
like okay talk to the security guys like

1207
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,440
no it's clearly an attack all right I'm

1208
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,599
sure it is and every single person had

1209
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,220
their own perspective on what it was

1210
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,720
based on what their tool was saying was

1211
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,160
wrong it took us another couple hours

1212
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,200
before we got everyone on the same page

1213
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,420
so intrinsically I think this makes some

1214
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,560
sense if we got a bunch of different

1215
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,380
tools we're poised to have longer

1216
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,079
outages as well as having to then go up

1217
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,599
and clean it up in a unify policies and

1218
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,760
everything else uh to snap things

1219
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,640
together so we move things together in

1220
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,640
this last stage we put in place more

1221
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,500
things for Federation we put in place

1222
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,599
more things for passwordless and we look

1223
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,460
for ways that we can have an integrated

1224
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,200
Tech stack without adding a whole bunch

1225
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,540
of tools we look for ways that we can

1226
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,300
have uh integration between those policy

1227
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,640
engines and those detective engines

1228
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,940
this was a study we just did this year a

1229
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,220
security outcome study they found that

1230
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,380
organization with highly integrated Tech

1231
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,060
Stacks integration between the policy

1232
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,859
engine integration between the objects

1233
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:09,240
integration between the orchestration

1234
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,380
and automation had 41 stronger detective

1235
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,200
controls they reported 41 stronger

1236
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,560
abilities to respond to events

1237
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,700
so

1238
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,500
in that last stage what we're trying to

1239
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,880
do is make sure we don't end up with too

1240
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,380
many tools and the tools are well

1241
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,780
integrated and well supported so that we

1242
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,160
can be in a defensive state

1243
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,060
all right with that I'll wrap up answer

1244
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,599
any questions

1245
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,300
so

1246
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,400
I'm gonna start thinking ahead a

1247
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,839
passwordless is pretty hot lots of

1248
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,819
people are talking about it which is

1249
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:49,800
good I think it's an exciting time to

1250
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,819
finally start moving away from

1251
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:53,220
passwordless however I think in general

1252
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,099
as as people we tend to like Define

1253
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,500
things in terms of what it's not I come

1254
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,940
from Detroit

1255
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,359
and high tech 100 years ago uh was not

1256
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,920
passwordless high-tech 100 years ago was

1257
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,780
the Horseless Carriage right what is it

1258
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,760
it's a carriage without a horse this is

1259
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,839
going to be great we're going to remove

1260
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,859
the horse

1261
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,140
that really

1262
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,060
lied and hides all the different

1263
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,160
improvements in speed and comfort and

1264
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,900
safety that happened from moving to a

1265
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,480
car right this is a Horseless Carriage I

1266
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,619
think that's how we're thinking about

1267
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,200
password I also think of course we've

1268
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,400
learned a lot we're not in the

1269
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,599
automotive industry we're not going to

1270
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,240
do that again we're not going to Define

1271
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,280
any Innovations about what they're not

1272
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,040
except for maybe the driverless car uh

1273
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,740
it's really as a the state of the way we

1274
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,359
think as humans

1275
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,180
in addition we know from a criminal

1276
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,760
perspective every single controller the

1277
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,800
past 60 years every single control we

1278
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,079
put in place has only bought us time

1279
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,420
until enough people adopted it and once

1280
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,339
enough people adopted it the adversaries

1281
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:55,619
were motivated to work around it and it

1282
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,359
has only gotten those Cycles have only

1283
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,819
gotten quicker in more recent years with

1284
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,380
people paying ransoms and everything

1285
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,660
else with adversaries being more funded

1286
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,760
so we know the minute we go ahead and

1287
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,859
move towards passiveness and move

1288
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:09,480
towards adoptions factors they're going

1289
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,640
to use weaknesses and factors they're

1290
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,400
going to use chinks in our apps and our

1291
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,859
apis they're going to use gaps in our

1292
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,660
processes for account recovery and

1293
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,460
identity proofing the addresses are

1294
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,680
going to use all that to compromise our

1295
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,900
systems so in moving forward with

1296
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,300
passwords I'd encourage you guys to go

1297
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,220
ahead and think short term and long term

1298
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,839
short-term in terms of projects and

1299
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:32,099
initiatives and piloting out this

1300
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,319
technology longer term in terms of

1301
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,720
putting in place controls that get ahead

1302
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,760
of some of these adversary actions that

1303
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,140
we can predict

1304
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,300
I'd encourage you guys to tie to broader

1305
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,859
initiatives so I like it when it's like

1306
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:45,660
oh we're doing a user experience

1307
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,980
initiative or we're doing an I.T

1308
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,660
modernization experience or customer

1309
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,940
first initiative and having passwords

1310
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,560
part of that I think is much better

1311
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,859
because again oftentimes those things we

1312
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:57,359
don't have a really good user benefits

1313
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,220
this is a great user benefit

1314
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,900
and then along those steps looking

1315
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,359
anyways possible to uh to increase the

1316
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,799
trust and Authentication

1317
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,780
all right with that any questions I've

1318
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,060
got a few more minutes

1319
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,660
yes sir

1320
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,230
um

1321
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,320
[Music]

1322
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,920
so I haven't seen anyone try password

1323
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,020
listen go back

1324
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,660
but the the problems that usually happen

1325
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,760
in a real world implementation would

1326
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,260
include the tech stack not supporting it

1327
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,720
like I mentioned also what's interesting

1328
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,180
is so um there's a lot of privacy

1329
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,520
concerns around biometrics and that

1330
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,900
makes sense because historically we

1331
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,819
stored all the Biometrics in some server

1332
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:46,800
system in the back end and trust us

1333
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,359
we're going to protect your data and

1334
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,520
then we got breached right so there

1335
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,220
there is a perception issue and

1336
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,619
rightfully so around Biometrics and with

1337
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,839
502 that says hey we're not even storing

1338
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,280
your Biometrics it's on your phone the

1339
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,839
Biometrics just unlock your phone to get

1340
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:04,140
into that Enclave from a technical

1341
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,760
perspective that's great

1342
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,800
but still from a human perspective wait

1343
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,900
a minute do I trust that the company is

1344
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,500
telling me that do I do I believe them

1345
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,359
so usually it run either runs a follow

1346
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,579
the tech not supporting it yet

1347
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:20,040
or runs to follow the uh customer

1348
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,380
organization the culture being

1349
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,880
suspicious of the the change

1350
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,099
yeah and then again the the

1351
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:31,740
um the edge cases just a real quick

1352
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,020
aside we spend so much time in our

1353
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,460
industry I feel like I'm ranting to this

1354
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,319
is Wolf frantic thank you for that guys

1355
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:39,240
I appreciate that we spend so much time

1356
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,160
in our industry like thinking about the

1357
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,140
white collar Workforce and solving for

1358
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,460
the white collar Workforce in the cloud

1359
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,440
and this works great there but what

1360
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,420
happens for your factory workers for

1361
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,160
your shift workers for your gig workers

1362
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,839
there's a lot of folks that we're not

1363
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,880
supporting yet both in this control and

1364
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,839
other Tech controls

1365
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,180
kind of along those same lines are there

1366
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,200
methods or approaches that you've seen

1367
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,780
more affected in helping bridge that gap

1368
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,760
for the situations where somebody does

1369
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,579
have concerns or is resistant to using

1370
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:13,260
their own smartphone or smart device or

1371
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,960
that the HR legal issues with that yeah

1372
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,300
so the question is bridging that concern

1373
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,819
one way to bridge it is you know I was

1374
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:22,920
showing you the roaming authenticator is

1375
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,319
give them keys right I love the UTF Keys

1376
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,900
give them fobs so it's not even touching

1377
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,359
the device that bypasses it all together

1378
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:32,339
and still provides a very high degree of

1379
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:33,900
security maybe we need to maintain those

1380
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,760
keys and there's a process behind it but

1381
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,740
so that's one way to do it the other way

1382
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,440
is just you know user user education and

1383
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,599
and conversations I think a lot of folks

1384
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,460
once they understand what's going on are

1385
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,700
much more open to it again if the

1386
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,619
there's not Union rules and other rules

1387
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,040
in place that we need to worry about

1388
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,900
so user education showing them the

1389
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,460
benefit once you're like oh I don't need

1390
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,560
like another password this is great it

1391
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,119
usually is a Tipping Point and looking

1392
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,839
at fobs

1393
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,520
all right well thank you very much

1394
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,839
everyone appreciate it
