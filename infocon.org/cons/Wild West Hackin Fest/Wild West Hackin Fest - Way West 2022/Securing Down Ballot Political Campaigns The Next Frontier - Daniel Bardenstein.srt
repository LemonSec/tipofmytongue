1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,160
good afternoon everyone at wild west

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,240
hack and fest uh my name is daniel

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,000
bardenstein um and i am uh uh jealous

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,840
that everyone is there and not able to

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,040
join but

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,400
thanks so much for joining me late in

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
the afternoon when folks are already

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
getting thirsty for a drink uh to talk

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,960
about something i'm very excited about

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
which is um something i've spent the

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
last couple years doing i think it's a

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
really important and not so talked about

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,199
topic uh which is securing down ballot

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,840
political campaigns um you know when we

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,239
all think about uh securing elections or

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,800
campaigns we often just think in very

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,520
large terms the presidentials we'll get

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,120
to some other examples that folks talk

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,079
about

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,160
but from what we've seen uh working with

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,920
campaigns all the way down the ballot

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
even down to the state and local

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
arenas uh there's a lot going on and i

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,559
think there's reason to be um i don't

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,079
want to say legitimately concerned but

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,840
you know really paying more attention as

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,760
a community to these really important

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,000
campaigns and and why they might be

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,239
increasingly appetizing for

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,799
um for adversaries

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
so a little bit about myself first like

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
i said my name is daniel barnstein i'm a

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,960
partner at foresight partners which is

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,280
this uh non-partisan product that i lead

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,320
uh in my spare time uh uh under which uh

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
guys i'm here speaking to today uh

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,280
normally i lead technology strategy uh

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,479
for a

39
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,920
government agency that some of you might

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,400
know called scissor but i'm not here on

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
behalf of my normal employer so nothing

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,159
i say here uh has anything to do with

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,000
things i do with my work at citizen or

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,400
uh is uh you know uh does not reflect

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
any of their opinions or abuse or any of

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,240
those caveats uh before joining

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,720
government and working on uh political

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,640
political campaigns my background has

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,360
mostly been in the private sector

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
actually building a lot of security

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
technology uh as a product manager so

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,399
building enterprise tools for large uh

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,960
organizations uh moved to government uh

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
to try to make a bit more of an impact i

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,040
got to lead cybersecurity for what was

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,880
called operation warp speed uh which was

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,119
the government's attempts to rapidly uh

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,360
research develop and distribute coca-19

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,840
vaccines um which was a very interesting

60
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,318
uh experience have a little bit of uh

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,160
policy background as well from some work

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,520
i did at the aspen institute working in

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,920
medical devices but for now um focusing

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
mostly on uh trying to make the

65
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
government a little bit more

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,160
smooth-running when it comes to

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
technology and continue to do this uh

68
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,480
support behind the scenes uh supporting

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,160
uh political campaigns uh across the

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
country and there's my twitter handle in

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,680
case folks want to stay in touch

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
afterwards since i can't enjoy lobby con

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,920
or lion conor any of the actual con

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,360
things in person

75
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
so uh i want to start off with a little

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
bit of story of how this began at least

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,160
for me you know i'm not the first person

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,879
to try to go into um political campaign

79
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,280
cyber security many have gone through

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,440
and uh um don't say failed but have

81
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
gotten tired of how hard it is to make a

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,280
change and there are many uh you know

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,120
many people have come back walking you

84
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
know the the direction where we're

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,800
walking and telling us it's not worth

86
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
going through so how do i get into this

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,080
so it started for me in 2018 and i was

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
volunteering um part time on a political

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
political campaign not too far north

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,560
from where everyone is right now um in

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,120
california's 25th district uh i was

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,200
friends with a campaign manager

93
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,040
who was running uh the campaign of an

94
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,159
incumbent uh sorry a challenger uh and

95
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,599
it was a really interesting race where

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,959
and again um

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,560
parties are not important here but there

98
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,799
was a an established incumbent who was

99
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,280
not very uh popular at the time and

100
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
there were two challengers from the

101
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,879
opposing party and so we were early in

102
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,360
primary season and whoever won the sense

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,920
was whoever won uh this primary kind of

104
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,720
the pre-election within each party race

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,159
had a very good chance of actually

106
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
winning the seat and getting sent uh to

107
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,840
the u.s congress

108
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
so again it's not necessarily a

109
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
powerhouse of a city by any means or an

110
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,440
area but again it still has

111
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
representation still sends people to

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
uh the seat of federal government and as

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,519
we all know from

114
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,439
especially recent years with the

115
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,000
gridlock in washington you know every

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
seat counts right so this is even though

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,159
it's not necessarily a big city or so to

118
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,879
say you know every election counts when

119
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
i got to the campa campaign again this

120
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,360
is a small challenger campaign so again

121
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
challenger someone who's not

122
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
who doesn't own the seat right the

123
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,040
opposite of an incumbent and so i i was

124
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
asked by my friend to just you know help

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,798
tighten up some security some tech i did

126
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,280
some uh data analysis

127
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,759
but you know some really uh egregious

128
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,360
things seeing uh early on which a lot of

129
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,520
us would think is um

130
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,800
wouldn't dream of seeing this in an

131
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
enterprise environment

132
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
the website that the candidate was

133
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
running was using a very questionable

134
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,199
not really um

135
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,680
well uh established uh web hosting

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,520
service for its website

137
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
didn't have access to logs didn't have

138
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
any protections enabled not even ssl

139
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,720
enabled on their website which is one of

140
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,479
the first things i had to do

141
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,280
no one was using any sort of

142
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,320
multi-factification passwords are being

143
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,160
shared and texted and again these are

144
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
people who are not super security savvy

145
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
or tech savvy and as we'll talk about a

146
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
little bit just running and breakneck

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
speed and just any moment that not

148
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
raising money or trying to get votes is

149
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,639
money wasted so security is not always

150
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,360
top of mind for these folks

151
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
and so i was able to spend some time um

152
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
you know just tightening things up uh

153
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
again wasn't really expecting anything

154
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,840
particularly exciting just doing what i

155
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,759
can to help make sure that you know if

156
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,560
anything it's a little bit of an

157
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,240
education exercise right

158
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
and then one saturday night i got a

159
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
frantic call from my friend the campaign

160
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
manager saying oh the website's down we

161
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,000
can't access anything um we're just

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
getting a bunch of uh 404s and we can't

163
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,800
log into our web portal anymore turns

164
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,639
out what what actually happened behind

165
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,000
the scenes one night when i jumped in

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
was uh there was a ddos attack that took

167
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
down our campaign website right before a

168
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,240
pretty critical uh fundraising debt so i

169
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
was able to go into the admin panel

170
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000
which again because this was a pretty

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
questionable web hosting service took me

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,039
a while just to get the right

173
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
permissions enables and actually try to

174
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
figure out whatever logs i could get

175
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,600
and again uh what was crazy is after

176
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
going in and doing a couple of

177
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,600
uh tweaks you know enabling uh

178
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,840
cloudflare and some other uh little

179
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,280
plug-ins that were

180
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,000
enabled uh this kept happening all right

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and and it wasn't just uh kind of what

182
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
we'd expect to be a very you know front

183
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
of the middle easy you know ddos attack

184
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,840
so to speak it was actually uh uh

185
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,319
strangely complex um and we actually got

186
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,680
hit three or four times so every request

187
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
was unique coming from this attack so

188
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
you know every single resource from you

189
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
know the get requests uh was unique the

190
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,639
user user agent strings were unique uh

191
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
different referrers on every request and

192
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,479
they're coming traffic was coming from

193
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
about 20 or so source ips and again

194
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
because of again that

195
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,759
use of technology early on i couldn't

196
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,080
just deploy a full-on kind of cloud

197
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
flare uh protective service around these

198
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
things or were finally able to kind of

199
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
later on and just didn't have the money

200
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,160
nor the tools to to respond quickly much

201
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,520
uh uh longer longer story i'm sorry

202
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
continuing on kind of what made it so

203
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,479
challenging to deal with because again

204
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,400
for most of us in our normal jobs

205
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,160
dealing with the ddos attack not

206
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
particularly difficult and we have the

207
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
right technology to do that

208
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,960
but like i mentioned limited access to

209
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
the network logs it took me hours in

210
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
that day just to get access to the

211
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,080
recent network logs

212
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,440
no admin access or i couldn't do

213
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,479
anything on my own because everything

214
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,880
was via this crappy web portal and part

215
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,639
of it again the title of this live bad

216
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,800
tech with bad times um this was a

217
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
company based in bulgaria there were

218
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,639
time zone differences they were very

219
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,240
slow in their response they weren't keen

220
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,840
to give me access to the back end where

221
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
i could actually run some scripts or

222
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,440
actually you know embed certain scripts

223
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,039
on the website to help do additional

224
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,919
defensive measures so um as we all know

225
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,120
you know the the

226
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
sometimes you pay for what you get you

227
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,479
don't pay for what you don't get when it

228
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
comes to technology which is a very um

229
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
strong uh learning here

230
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,199
and a very long story short and this

231
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,840
could be maybe its own talk one day but

232
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,199
you know after these initial ddos

233
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
attacks were able to kind of harden

234
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,039
things up uh sufficiently we did some

235
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,319
forensics found out that a lot of the

236
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
stuff was being launched from ec2

237
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
infrastructure which again as a private

238
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
citizen there's not much you can do

239
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,039
then we tried to report this to

240
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,360
authorities about radio silence from

241
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
them

242
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,840
the candidate i was working with uh

243
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,319
ended up losing uh the primary race to

244
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,639
his opponent at the time that that

245
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,560
person that he lost to ended up becoming

246
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,639
a congress person frequently before

247
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
having to resign this scandal not

248
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,240
avoiding names we can probably look it

249
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,120
up

250
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,479
but after enough silence actually the

251
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,680
campaign manager i was working with

252
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,840
finally got rolling stone to write up a

253
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
full-length news article about this

254
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,919
attack and uh kind of the weirdness

255
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
around it and some of the other you know

256
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
interesting other

257
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,399
we're going to call them incidents but

258
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,559
there are a couple other campaigns

259
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
and uh at that time that we're seeing

260
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919
some um uh weirdness on cyberspace uh

261
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,760
and then as a result of that article

262
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
the fbi reached out finally and we

263
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
actually uh start up an fbi

264
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,519
investigation which was interesting to

265
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,800
say at least

266
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
show that my forensics the logs are able

267
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
to get turns out the person on the other

268
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,399
side of things wasn't very good at opsec

269
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,480
used their personal credit card

270
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
personal email

271
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,920
they were married to a staffer on the

272
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,959
primary

273
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
opponents campaign so there's a pretty

274
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,880
strong case there

275
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,240
and then can't go into too much more

276
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,920
detail there but there's still an active

277
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,839
case after all this time

278
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,519
which from what i understand potentially

279
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,200
might be the first federal case for

280
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
domestic electronic election

281
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,000
interference that in the u.s um and so

282
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
we'll see what happens and there might

283
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
be some precedence set but um this is

284
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,959
all just kind of the story of how i got

285
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,600
in here and we'll see this is a um

286
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,800
we'll see what happens and there's

287
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,160
there's a lot of lessons here especially

288
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,800
from the legal perspective and the lack

289
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
thereof so we decided to do something

290
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
about you know this experience leaving

291
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,160
uh myself and my partner who's

292
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
unfortunately able to join today

293
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,080
and so our past we have worked together

294
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
at a previous company and so we rejoined

295
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,240
in 2020 and uh created this group called

296
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
foresight again we're not here to sell

297
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
anything because everything we do is

298
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
pretty much for free and it's for a

299
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
political campaign so just to give a

300
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,839
little bit of background about who we

301
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
are and what we do and why it's relevant

302
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,720
and you know some of the stuff that

303
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,160
we're going to talk about so

304
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,920
we're now as non-partisan non-profit

305
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
we're across the aisle

306
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
just from starting 2020 i believe we're

307
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
the largest provider of cyber training

308
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,040
to political campaigns in the us

309
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
we also developed uh kinder

310
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
disinformation training and tabletop

311
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,680
exercise along with some additional

312
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,440
cyber security support that we do we'll

313
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,279
do some custom work that's needed but

314
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,959
you know we decided to basically jump in

315
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,680
the race for a registered 501c3

316
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,640
and we i worked with a pretty sizable

317
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,399
number of people just in the 2020 cycle

318
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,160
alone so we trained over a thousand

319
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,279
people that's 150 campaigns over 15

320
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,640
state parties

321
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,519
so now for 2022 we're looking to

322
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,000
have a a similar impact if not a little

323
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,640
bit more uh and so you know given uh the

324
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,920
experience we've had you know especially

325
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
in 2020 we wanted to walk i went through

326
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,920
what does a political campaign look like

327
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,120
is there some things you might expect

328
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
but also some things that make it a

329
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,320
little bit different from you know what

330
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,720
it might seem like on the outside um so

331
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,079
obviously and again when i'm talking

332
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,440
about political campaigns i'm not going

333
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,760
to talk about your you know you might

334
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,160
imagine that like if you're pelosi or

335
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,720
schumer or mcconnell you probably have a

336
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
pretty well oiled machine for reelection

337
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,079
you've been doing it long enough you

338
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,560
have teams your resources you have brand

339
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,079
name recognition

340
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,200
i'm going to focus more on the

341
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
challengers or the the the you know

342
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,040
lesser-known folks especially at the

343
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,120
state level that don't have that level

344
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,360
of resources so we have really small

345
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,560
staff

346
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,399
the candidates who are kind of the life

347
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,160
and blood of the campaign are really

348
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
busy uh and really distracted and

349
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,519
oftentimes

350
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,800
you know everything just like an

351
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
organization when you know culture

352
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
security starts with the c-suite of ceo

353
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,519
standing with a political campaign if

354
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,040
we've worked with uh campaigns where the

355
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
candidates really care about security

356
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,880
and everyone else follows suit but

357
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
oftentimes it's the candidate much like

358
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,600
our boards and you know enterprise uh

359
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
uh situations that's the one that we

360
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
have to kind of drag ahead and get them

361
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
to um

362
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,959
to pay attention and it's really hard

363
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,480
for you think candidates might be a

364
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,600
little bit more invested because they

365
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
really want to win and invest in their

366
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,720
own money in their time um but just as a

367
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,440
little factoid here you know every it's

368
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
expected if i remember correctly that

369
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,880
political candidates are expected to

370
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,800
raise about a thousand dollars an hour

371
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,320
in what they call call time where they

372
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,800
just call people and ask for money and

373
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,079
any time that's not spent raising money

374
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,920
is lost time and lost money and a

375
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,200
thousand dollars an hour is a pretty

376
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
high rate even think for our average

377
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,120
corporate lawyer for example

378
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
so that those are the types of folks

379
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,079
that we're working with and trying to

380
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,120
nudge them to be a little bit more

381
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,399
secure in their behavior

382
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
political campaigns are also running at

383
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
hyper speed these are seven day a week

384
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,279
you know

385
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,800
definitely more than eight hour day

386
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
often times more than 10 hour days but

387
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
they don't have any money it's not like

388
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
they're a well-funded startup that's

389
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
moving fast but they have lots of

390
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,120
venture funds to invest in good tech

391
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
and on top of this pretty much all these

392
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
people have a little of any technical

393
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,079
knowledge they just want tech to be

394
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,760
there they want to get free stuff you

395
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
know the campaign i worked at the

396
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,600
website was set up by the

397
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
sister-in-law of the candidate right

398
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,519
which explains some of the early tech

399
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
decisions uh that were there so

400
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,839
political campaigns are a pretty unique

401
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,519
piece in many ways

402
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,600
um and kind of drawing on along this

403
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
theme uh same but different so in some

404
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,240
ways they look like small medium

405
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
businesses in the terms of their lack of

406
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,279
resources

407
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,880
and maybe they don't have as high a

408
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,959
profile for an adversary

409
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,120
but they move significantly faster so

410
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,160
they don't have as much of that

411
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,959
tolerance as an smb might in terms of

412
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,800
you know the ability to decide uh you

413
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,959
know take time to decide or

414
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,240
you know do research on various tools so

415
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,079
that's one way i'm really changing the

416
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,160
culturally is quite different

417
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,519
but on the pace side they're much more

418
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,399
similar to tech startups however they

419
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,760
don't care about longevity they're all

420
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
going to burn down after eight months

421
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,920
right if the candidate wins or doesn't

422
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
win either way the campaign pretty much

423
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,839
um dissipates after them so they don't

424
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,600
really care about making like long-term

425
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,279
and farmers tech decisions for living

426
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,519
with tech debt or or any sort of like

427
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
configuration debt which makes things

428
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,880
really interesting

429
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,120
and obviously they care about money

430
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,480
not that they have a lot of it to spend

431
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
on security which is um you know as

432
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
something that we all know

433
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,519
but they don't have a ton of sensitive

434
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,560
data

435
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,600
you know it's not like they have

436
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
secretly planned strategies they have

437
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,680
donor data but oftentimes that's hosted

438
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
elsewhere

439
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
so sometimes there's there's a little

440
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,079
bit less of a concern about you know

441
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,079
maybe hack and leak could be a of a

442
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,560
potential concern but it's not like

443
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,240
there's going to be some treasure trove

444
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,040
of pii or or some sort of uh you know

445
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
kpop for example any sort of sensitive

446
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,600
data

447
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
and we've

448
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,639
we've seen some some pretty surprising

449
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,839
things you know it's not like we're

450
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,120
chasing after you know we want to offer

451
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
this service we want to educate

452
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,800
political campaigns and potentially

453
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,639
future elected officials on cyber

454
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,839
security

455
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,000
but we actually see a good amount of

456
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,320
weird activity and also just outdated of

457
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
just bad tech practices

458
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,839
we see a lot of outdated tech i was on a

459
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,760
call with someone last week that was

460
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,560
still using hotmail for their email

461
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,720
and also still using some for web

462
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,279
hosting providers um a lot of really bad

463
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,240
password practices as we're all

464
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,680
not surprised about usb is this snapshot

465
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,079
is a picture of something we actually

466
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,440
got one of the campaigns we worked with

467
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
in 2020 actually received a mailed

468
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
envelope with this usb drive and you may

469
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
not be able to see it but it says

470
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
thumb drive thumb drive thumb drive

471
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,560
socialism isn't the answer and some

472
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,079
other stuff and they were really hoping

473
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
that that that little political campaign

474
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,399
uh would plug in this usb drive

475
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,519
obviously they didn't because they sent

476
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,199
it to us and we were able to do some

477
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,720
analysis and there would have been bad

478
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,959
times on on the other side of that so

479
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,160
you'll have social media account

480
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,880
takeovers which happens uh increasingly

481
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,560
we see doxxing and we've also seen some

482
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
physical infiltration this obviously was

483
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
a little bit before

484
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,680
covent times

485
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,519
but even there you think of like your

486
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,759
project veritas for example or other

487
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,079
other groups that actually try to send

488
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,000
you know human volunteers like

489
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
physically into buildings either posing

490
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,040
as someone

491
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
who wants to be a volunteer or take

492
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,079
screenshots

493
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,720
so we've actually seen uh both poor tech

494
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
but also like active threats against uh

495
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,880
political political political campaigns

496
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
and many different um and at the end of

497
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
the day at the end of the day what we're

498
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
trying to do and what i would try to get

499
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,639
this the larger community the security

500
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
to think about is this is really focused

501
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,160
on human-centered security right we're

502
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
not the answer isn't just to throw

503
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,880
edr or any of our you know big expansive

504
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,120
enterprise tools at these campaigns um

505
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,040
because it's just not gonna work

506
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,639
so we really have to focus on how to

507
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,360
actually change human behavior because

508
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
you know in these environments humans

509
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
are at the center of the security

510
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,399
equation right and it's we and they also

511
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,480
don't have the time or patients just

512
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,079
undergo a bunch of phishing trainings or

513
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,360
pitching assessments that we also

514
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,600
typically do in our

515
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,519
so we really have to think about when

516
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,120
we're really thinking about

517
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,519
humans and human centered security it's

518
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,440
really all about behavior change right

519
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
so how as security professionals do we

520
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,320
get humans to change their behaviors

521
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
so you might think okay well there's a

522
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,600
lot of stuff out there already and there

523
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,839
must be stuff out there already in the

524
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,680
political campaign world and there is

525
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
but it's mostly all checklists um so the

526
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,240
harvard kennedy welfare center has a big

527
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,759
cyber security campaign playbook it's a

528
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,040
very long checklist of everything that

529
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,280
should be done the dnc and i believe the

530
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,679
rnc both publish security checklists for

531
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,359
their campaigns

532
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,760
and there's just checklist galore but as

533
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,480
many of folks in the audience probably

534
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,280
know

535
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,240
there's very difference between just

536
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,599
writing out a checklist and handing it

537
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,039
to someone and then actually getting you

538
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,799
know understood or implemented or

539
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,359
implemented well um or or verified for

540
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
that reason

541
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,280
and again same thing on on this initial

542
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
a campaign i worked on

543
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,840
uh their their um central political

544
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
committee uh had sent them a checklist

545
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,039
of all the cyber stuff they should be

546
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,799
doing on the technology stuff and they

547
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,320
were all too busy and didn't care just

548
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,200
you know did what they needed to

549
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
but again as we continue to see

550
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
checklist-based security both in the

551
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,640
political campaign world and in the

552
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
government and enterprise world doesn't

553
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
really work well and so we try to take a

554
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,840
different approach

555
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,880
so we start off with a lot of

556
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,400
storytelling

557
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
and you know especially i know we all

558
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,039
hate fud and fud as a means of selling

559
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
uh security

560
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
but you know especially telling stories

561
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,200
that um you know open people's eyes that

562
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,160
are relevant to what people are doing

563
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
but also like aren't so far-fetched or

564
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
like oh the russians are gonna you know

565
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,919
try to hack your random campaign and you

566
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,280
know this for this state right like what

567
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
are the most realistic scenarios you can

568
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,720
think of this as threat modeling except

569
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,480
we have to do it uh because the

570
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,760
political campaign doesn't have the time

571
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
or the knowledge

572
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,039
but telling stories really connects with

573
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,400
people in terms of getting them to

574
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
understand what are examples of threats

575
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,919
why should they care

576
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,360
and and you know make sure they don't

577
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,559
feel super helpless about it right it

578
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,480
kind of helps them identify we have to

579
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,039
try to keep the examples really relevant

580
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,120
i can't say many times even on a paddle

581
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,039
as recently as yesterday you know we in

582
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,679
security we like to point out or whether

583
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,120
you know often the press will often

584
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,640
point out these kind of key economic

585
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
exam canonical examples of like major

586
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
cyber incidents whether it's oldsmore

587
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,559
colonial pipeline or

588
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,080
jbs or whatnot and then kind of you know

589
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
between the press and sales people we

590
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,000
kind of use these incidents to sell

591
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
whatever it is that we're selling even

592
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,120
if those stories don't actually resonate

593
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,240
with the

594
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,600
end customers or the stakeholders that

595
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
we're trying to work with we'll try to

596
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
keep our examples really relevant to

597
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,559
political campaigns

598
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,480
and and again really try to get that

599
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,000
sense of empathy

600
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,480
next we try to provide clear easy fixes

601
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
right and and this is a lot of how uh

602
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
our overall approach uh we're not gonna

603
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,559
do anything that involves you know

604
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,320
opening up a command line or anything

605
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
super technical we've got to be simple

606
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,000
fast cheap we have to make people feel

607
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,840
empowered right because if you

608
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,120
bring a bunch of doom and gloom and

609
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,559
there's nothing you can do and a

610
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,640
determined adversary can totally pop

611
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,520
everything you're doing and you're

612
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,679
screwed which is true

613
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,160
but maybe not likely people aren't going

614
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,919
to be as likely to change their behavior

615
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,960
if they don't think it will make a

616
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,080
difference right which is really

617
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
important if you want to change users

618
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
behavior you have to make them feel

619
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,720
empowered and make them feel that they

620
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,080
can make a difference and their their

621
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,320
actions can make a difference and lastly

622
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,919
we provide support so we don't just go

623
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,480
in and parachute and say here's your

624
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
security training and awareness and your

625
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,520
yuba keys

626
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,960
have a nice life

627
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,280
we stay involved we have a slack

628
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,600
community for our current and previous

629
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,039
campaigns

630
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,200
you know we were always reachable and so

631
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
maintaining constant support with our

632
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
users again it's not just a political

633
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
campaign example but it's often times

634
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
we're busy we just want to chuck stuff

635
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
over the fence and say all right here's

636
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,799
a eubaiker here's the thing go configure

637
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,480
it well

638
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,919
it doesn't always happen unless you need

639
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,880
you know sometimes you need a little bit

640
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,840
of

641
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,440
good touch uh a little bit of light

642
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
touch to get people you know just on on

643
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,720
the path

644
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,559
um and we've i think we've seen some

645
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,880
really um some really promising data and

646
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,799
we do collect data before and after we

647
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,600
do our trainings and again

648
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,000
and series of uh increments afterwards

649
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,679
and so we'll see pretty significant

650
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,960
increases in the amount of you know

651
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,240
users that are you know deploying

652
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,400
multi-factor authentication using

653
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,480
password managers or otherwise just

654
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,880
deploying stronger passwords uh and

655
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,720
again i don't again the goal is not to

656
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,640
get into whether password managers are

657
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,400
the most secure type of technology

658
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,080
because if you spend too much time on

659
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,280
infosec twitter you know that there's

660
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
some strong opinions there but it's a

661
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,320
hell of a lot better than what a lot of

662
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,679
people are doing with their passwords

663
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,360
and creating really weak passwords and

664
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
storing them in you know very easily

665
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,480
accessible places

666
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,840
we can even get these non-technical

667
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
folks to encrypt their devices uh and

668
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
turn on auto updates which um again

669
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
especially on the former one uh it's not

670
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,760
something you'd expect your your

671
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,440
non-technical person to do

672
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,600
and um pretty much everyone we train

673
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,760
ends up uh adopting at least one secure

674
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
behavior after one week so we like to

675
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,440
think that the approach that we

676
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,120
are working on and continue to iterate

677
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,840
on

678
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,520
has actually been uh fairly fairly

679
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,039
successful in terms of changing user

680
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,559
behavior and again we don't think this

681
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,000
is necessarily true just for political

682
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
campaigns but potentially could be you

683
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,039
know

684
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,400
used more broadly

685
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
and so we have some some lessons and

686
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,080
goals from you know what we've done uh

687
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,640
thus far um and continue to do and i can

688
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
continue to integrate on uh the first um

689
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,440
supporting good tech decisions early on

690
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
is critical

691
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
again there might be some startup

692
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,440
startup folks in the crowd or folks who

693
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
might start their own companies

694
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
making those early good tech decisions

695
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,159
early on

696
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,000
makes all the difference

697
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
again from a political campaign

698
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
perspective

699
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,799
picking out you know using just a

700
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,880
squarespace or a wix or you could do

701
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,480
miles ahead of folks

702
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
that are using you know custom you know

703
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,440
you know

704
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
web hosting services or some other old

705
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,600
one that they found for free somewhere

706
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,039
they have a some sort of discount down

707
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,080
right even if it costs a little bit of

708
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,159
money enabling as much security by

709
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,080
default as possible especially behind

710
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,200
the scenes

711
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,559
um so you know against common common um

712
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,679
examples

713
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,600
that we focus on for political campaigns

714
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,360
but also again more in general things

715
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,039
like mfa

716
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,039
dmarc for emails

717
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,280
i know as much as you know ultimate goal

718
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,520
for us is can we make it as transparent

719
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,120
as possible for the user to get all

720
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
these security functions without getting

721
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,559
them you know they're essentially our

722
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,159
clients to have it you know setting up

723
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,120
for them

724
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,960
uh we're trying to develop this thing

725
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,720
called the campaign in a box which is

726
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
this this

727
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
concept where if somebody decides they

728
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,840
want to you know run a political

729
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
campaign start a political campaign

730
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,240
can we just provide them this

731
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,760
whatever it is if it's a zip file if

732
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,080
it's a guide or a website or whatever

733
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,240
that just you know it opens everything

734
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,919
up and sets everything up

735
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,440
pre-configured with all of the right

736
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,679
security practices in place uh has all

737
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,840
the right secure tools so you know we'll

738
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,760
we'll recommend or help set up signal

739
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
automatically as opposed to using open

740
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,919
sms for mfa or normal communications

741
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,440
how do you get as much of that secure by

742
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,679
default secure by design into like a

743
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,520
one-click you know

744
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
everything we need is is already there

745
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
right

746
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
and then lastly for when there are cases

747
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,600
you know we all we're all busy you know

748
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,279
and we don't want to tell everyone to

749
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,039
you know rtfm

750
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,480
for example

751
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,720
writing super simple guides uh is really

752
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,039
important but also again you know i i

753
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,799
say as a last resort because we want to

754
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,559
make this stuff as transparent as

755
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,600
possible

756
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,880
but having guys for people to walk

757
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,120
through themselves super importance uh

758
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,799
and i also can't stress having been in

759
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,600
the

760
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,200
in and around the infosec community for

761
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,640
a while

762
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
our guides aren't as simple as we think

763
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,400
they are right because we tend to think

764
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,559
of them from our perspective our

765
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,720
technical aptitude

766
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,400
you know it's oh it's so clear what you

767
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,919
do after you need to do the step or

768
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,960
where you'd go to find

769
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,799
you know what happens if

770
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,640
i get a phishing email oh it's so clear

771
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,919
to tell oh i need to look through every

772
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
single you know common advice people get

773
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,720
is

774
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,159
like when

775
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,240
detecting a suspicious links and

776
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,080
phishing emails oh you have to hover

777
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,520
over the link and see where it's going

778
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,440
and determine whether the domain is a

779
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,039
trusted domain before you click on the

780
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,880
link none of that stuff makes sense to

781
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
your average user right how do i hover

782
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,799
like even on most browsers you hover

783
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,320
over it and you know in chrome or

784
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,400
firefox you see that tiny little banner

785
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
at the bottom most people aren't going

786
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,279
to look at that and then how do they

787
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,880
know if it's a trusted domain right they

788
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,279
don't know that alexa top 1000 uh

789
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,840
domains are what's verified so a lot of

790
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,279
this stuff it just goes over most

791
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,960
people's heads and so you know as a

792
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,120
community we just want to you know good

793
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
securities transparent security um

794
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,720
because if anything is too inconvenient

795
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
for users we're not going to

796
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,480
actually put into place better security

797
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,520
behaviors

798
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
and then that's bad for us and for the

799
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
overall efforts obviously

800
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,200
why should we care so i'm talking about

801
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
you know helping secure you know uh down

802
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,039
below political campaigns right it's not

803
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,559
it's not the president it's not the

804
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,600
pelosi's or the mcconnells

805
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
many of these folks lose so this is my

806
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
state or local representative uh they're

807
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,080
probably not the most targeted victims

808
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,720
for for adversaries well why why am i

809
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,320
here talking about this why should we as

810
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,240
security professionals care

811
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,919
and i think there are a lot of reasons

812
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,760
so when we think typically think about

813
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
election security or you know political

814
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,360
campaigns they'll tend to think about

815
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,880
the same things we think about you know

816
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,760
2016 was kind of the watershed year at

817
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,400
least for us domestic in the us between

818
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,360
you know

819
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,080
hillary's uh emails and and her and you

820
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,760
know john podesta clicking on the link

821
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,880
that both the dnc and the d triple c uh

822
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,360
both got a compromise uh we had

823
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,200
allegations and activity around uh

824
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,039
russian behavior uh in 2016. uh and also

825
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,640
we always just think of

826
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,240
compromised election machines like the

827
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,279
actual voting voting machines um which

828
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,039
there are there's still much work to do

829
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,039
especially in that ladder space

830
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,080
a lot of

831
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,720
good work going on but a lot of it again

832
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,080
of the problem and as we'll talk about

833
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,600
in a sec not the only ways that the

834
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,760
adversaries can can make a large-scale

835
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,960
impact especially now that there's so

836
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,360
much scrutiny um and research going on

837
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,880
and we generally hope genuinely hope

838
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
that that continues but it's a lot more

839
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,320
common than folks thinking these are

840
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,080
just a couple of high-level uh written

841
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,600
up at tampa because most of them go

842
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,520
under the radar so you know there's a

843
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,960
bec attack on wisconsin gop in 2020 that

844
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
lost 2.3 million dollars which again is

845
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
a lot even for a state party

846
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,279
this is also a case and i believe 2020

847
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,400
as well

848
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,760
where um

849
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,360
a candidate realized that several of her

850
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,600
accounts were compromised by ips that

851
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,760
allegedly sourced back to russia and

852
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,120
were accessing some class that they

853
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,960
shouldn't have and it exported some data

854
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,039
but i can't tell you how many anecdotes

855
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,400
there are of people who worked in

856
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
political campaigns even going back you

857
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,799
know six or eight years that have

858
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,880
somehow been been compromised

859
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,440
via phishing uh hack and leak you know

860
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,919
getting names uh sense of information of

861
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,440
donors there's been a lot of doxing

862
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,679
a lot of you know trying to um you know

863
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,200
compromising email accounts and sending

864
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,919
them out to journalists or people to to

865
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,360
saying very not nice things that piss

866
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
people off

867
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,000
but none of this stuff gets written up

868
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,360
and so you know we're always left to

869
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,480
think about these very kind of

870
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,399
high-level high-powered issues

871
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,240
when it's really happening all the time

872
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,799
at all levels of you know political

873
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,919
campaigns

874
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,840
um and there's another kind of deeper

875
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,000
problem here around of opportunity and

876
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,640
accountability so like many other things

877
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,720
uh in life you know the better resourced

878
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,039
folks are at an advantage right so when

879
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,559
we think about incumbents versus

880
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,559
challengers many of us probably you know

881
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,000
in civics class growing up you learned

882
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,159
that oh and incumbents have a much

883
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,159
higher rate of winning re-election part

884
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,360
of it's because they have the name

885
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
recognition but they also have a lot of

886
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,120
money and money matters a lot and money

887
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,360
pays for better tech money pays for

888
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,760
dedicated i.t security staff which many

889
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,919
of these larger campaigns do and again

890
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,600
these are things that that

891
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,279
are afforded mostly to incumbents or

892
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,360
self-funded candidates uh which

893
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,000
obviously means wealthier candidates

894
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,080
and so when we think about you know if

895
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,840
we're trying to hold our current elected

896
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,520
officials to account or want to make

897
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,360
sure that it's not just who has the most

898
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,440
money so they can you know either buy

899
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,320
the most ads or secure you know keep

900
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,000
their campaign the most secure that

901
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
really puts challengers that is a

902
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,360
disadvantage so we think about if we

903
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,880
want our governments to you know work

904
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,720
for the people and we want to hold our

905
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,640
elected officials accountable we want to

906
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,399
make sure that people who who are a

907
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,919
little bit more uh you know we don't

908
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,200
just like i said we don't just have a

909
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,880
bunch of more wealthy folks running for

910
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,760
office

911
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,440
this is another thing that puts them at

912
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,200
a disadvantage right

913
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,080
you don't

914
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,039
have that sort of uh those resources to

915
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,880
you know buy the right track buy buy the

916
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
right tech or even just buy tech at all

917
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,960
or you know under i'll be able to

918
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,399
recover if there is some sort of uh

919
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,320
incident that that might happen

920
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
and and i think another thing that that

921
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
folks overlooked too is the power of

922
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
state and local and again down ballot uh

923
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,880
campaigns even though we've learned

924
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
and again it's very much part of the

925
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,039
american ethos the power of the federal

926
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,720
government which obviously you know not

927
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
dying the power of the federal

928
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,480
government we've also seen uh how much

929
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,559
in in recent years

930
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,279
states especially play huge roles in our

931
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,360
everyday lives uh we think about

932
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
redistricting right so the 2020 census

933
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,679
just happened maps are being you know

934
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,039
where you know

935
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,039
uh you know everyone you know signs up

936
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,200
fills up the form uh and then at the

937
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,520
state level new district maps are drawn

938
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
that controls how many congress people

939
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
you have that's what gerrymandering

940
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,039
tends to happen that's all wrong at the

941
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,200
state level right so we think about how

942
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,880
you know you know

943
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,159
just keep it back to gerrymandering

944
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,919
without going into anything partisan

945
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,679
that's that's power that you know state

946
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,679
uh legislatures have and elected

947
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,159
officials have uh state laws

948
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,919
again we'll try to keep things uh

949
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,080
without going uh into too many examples

950
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,159
here but everything from you know we've

951
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,399
dealt with mass mandates or you know

952
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,960
covered related uh uh regulations or

953
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,440
laws at the state level uh people are

954
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
probably tracking that there's the leak

955
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,039
out of the supreme court around uh

956
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,480
abortion

957
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,159
where things get passed down back to the

958
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,000
states or when states are passing their

959
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
laws about something that's consensus

960
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,720
abortion that that's something that

961
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,880
states uh that state of elected

962
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,440
officials control confirming judges uh

963
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
at the state level uh again also falls

964
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,559
on on uh uh officials uh many of these

965
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,640
people will probably graduate from state

966
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,880
and local level and go up to congress or

967
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,480
to other federal levels and have amassed

968
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,559
more power and also at the state level

969
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,320
uh states control their own elections

970
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,200
right so you figure out who can vote

971
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,360
you know how you know can how easy is it

972
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,919
to vote in a particular state

973
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,159
or how easy is it to develop absentee

974
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,799
ballot how long are the polls open for

975
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,960
all these things uh are controlled at

976
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,120
the state level and it's really really

977
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
powerful and as we all know they're a

978
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,799
lot you know typically more under the

979
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,159
radar than federal races it takes a lot

980
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,720
fewer seats and votes to win than at

981
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,519
federal uh uh races and i think both

982
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,200
parties have started to realize that

983
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
there's actually a lot of power to be

984
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,440
had at the state level and actually

985
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,279
either bypassing at the federal level or

986
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,200
when there's a lot of gridlock federally

987
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,720
in washington dc whether it's responding

988
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,600
to a pandemic or passing

989
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,640
laws that you know might affect people's

990
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
freedoms or ability to you know do what

991
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,720
they need to do there's a lot of power

992
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,320
for folks who you know who are running

993
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,559
for state and local office

994
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,120
so our overall theory and on the darker

995
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,559
side of prediction we think that

996
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,919
adversaries can actually have a pretty

997
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,320
significant impact on you know u.s

998
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,240
political divisions our internal

999
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,559
conflict our culture and our policy by

1000
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,080
influencing large amounts of local

1001
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,240
elections rather than trying to

1002
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,919
interfere at the top-level races but

1003
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,279
there's a lot more scrutiny there's a

1004
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,720
lot more money

1005
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
there's a lot a lot more people's eyes

1006
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,039
on it and even as we've seen now

1007
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,360
with all the gridlock in dc that the

1008
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,440
president and congress aren't putting

1009
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,080
out as much as each of them would like

1010
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,440
or think they're they're capable of

1011
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,480
putting out

1012
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,039
so it is it stands to reason and again i

1013
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,240
think we start to see a little bit of

1014
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
this and especially when we think about

1015
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,519
certain adversaries ultimate objectives

1016
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,519
when we think about disinformation and

1017
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,760
class elections is you actually actually

1018
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,880
have a pretty

1019
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,760
serious impact on other countries by

1020
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,679
impacting local elections which again

1021
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,159
much lower barriers to entry i talked

1022
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,399
earlier about the low sophistication of

1023
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,320
technology the lack of people doing

1024
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
security in this field and so as an

1025
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,039
adversary maybe not a bad idea or maybe

1026
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,480
if there's some you know maybe there's a

1027
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,559
particular state or you know again the

1028
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,039
senate right now is is very very close

1029
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,399
even a couple seats can swing it from

1030
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,919
one party to the other and we all know

1031
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,519
the senate is also incredibly important

1032
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,799
incredibly important at the federal

1033
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,960
level it's not too far-fetched to think

1034
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,880
that for a particularly close race that

1035
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,720
might tip uh the senate one way or the

1036
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
other or congress one or the other uh

1037
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,039
determined adversary can start you know

1038
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,720
trying to meddle uh with particular

1039
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,399
elections or even the folks that might

1040
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,640
feed up to that in a couple of years

1041
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
and we think this is only going to get

1042
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
easier for adversaries

1043
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
circling back to the little ddos story

1044
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,760
at the beginning on the campaign are we

1045
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,600
used it turned out it was probably a

1046
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,399
variant of of the hulk ddos

1047
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,240
and a very interesting right word or

1048
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,159
tool proposed or familiar with with the

1049
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,559
hulk hulk tool it's basically kind of

1050
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,320
like a very easy download plug-and-play

1051
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,480
ddos tool that generates a fairly

1052
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,000
sophisticated set of requests that makes

1053
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,679
it pretty harder uh pretty hard to block

1054
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,880
unless you have you know more

1055
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,480
sophisticated tools

1056
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,240
we also have changing business models

1057
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,559
within our adversary's infrastructure

1058
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,559
you know ddos as a service just general

1059
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,960
things as a service right you can access

1060
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,480
as a service there's a lot of schools

1061
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,640
you can just plug and play so again and

1062
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,480
back in the the case that i dealt with

1063
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,720
and back in 2018 this was the guy who i

1064
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,320
think was like a web developer maybe an

1065
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,640
it guy who just went online and you know

1066
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,559
they literally government found his

1067
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,320
browser searches looking for like ddos

1068
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,079
tools and he downloaded it you use his

1069
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,918
credit card he's actually able to have

1070
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,599
an impact and this is not going to get

1071
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,440
any harder for your average script kitty

1072
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,760
to be able to get access to the decent

1073
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,079
tools to cause um some sort of

1074
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,159
consequences of consequences there are

1075
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,079
very few it's still a very clever again

1076
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,320
a few eyes so not very rare that any of

1077
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,918
this stuff gets caught it's really

1078
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,399
unclear um which law enforcement u.s law

1079
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,000
enforcement agency has jurisdiction over

1080
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,159
this right fbi won't touch anything

1081
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,679
unless it's generally unless it's of a

1082
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,599
certain level like congress or above or

1083
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,119
there's a certain amount of damages that

1084
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,520
were done sizza does general election

1085
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,960
security but may not necessarily jump

1086
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,040
into specific political campaigns and

1087
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
terms and it's not a law enforcement

1088
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,839
agency

1089
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,159
other parts of dhs it's really unclear

1090
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,839
you know when we were when i was uh on

1091
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,119
this campaign it was unclear who we

1092
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,079
turned to

1093
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,918
would actually be able to to help us at

1094
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,760
the time and again the legal framework

1095
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,960
and this could be you know like a

1096
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,720
separate talk because the

1097
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,400
you know this case might be pushing a

1098
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,920
new precedent or setting a new president

1099
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
when it comes to election interference

1100
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,480
in challengers for federal or

1101
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,240
congressional campaigns there's not only

1102
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,560
much of a legal framework there so you

1103
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,119
know we see the access is getting easier

1104
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,599
there are very few consequences and with

1105
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,280
minimal effort you can have a surprising

1106
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,119
amount of impact if you're able to

1107
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,920
impact people's you know fundraising or

1108
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,599
again hack and leak

1109
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,240
any of the kind of typical tdps if you

1110
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,040
will

1111
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,480
that might actually

1112
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,960
cause an impact in a political campaign

1113
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,480
context

1114
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,079
and it really could have worked in this

1115
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,400
little district that i worked on back in

1116
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,800
2018 like i mentioned the primary point

1117
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,560
that that by canada lost to ended up

1118
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,240
going to congress

1119
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,200
and you know until uh they had to resign

1120
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,960
under um

1121
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,800
some some interesting circumstances

1122
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,040
shall we say had to see the tables was

1123
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,440
on certain committees you know had a

1124
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,839
very bright future in in their party

1125
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,280
so again people don't really think about

1126
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,880
that kind of longer tale of what might

1127
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,960
happen but and again it's unclear and

1128
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
i'm not gonna presuppose that these ddos

1129
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,359
attacks made the candidate i worked for

1130
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,119
lose right or affected the votes too

1131
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,000
much

1132
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,680
this also wasn't a very sophisticated

1133
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,160
adversary but if it was intentional or

1134
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,200
it could have been intentional or

1135
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,560
somebody tries a similar thing in a

1136
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,800
different jurisdiction

1137
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,079
they could have the same impact that

1138
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,000
could be someone you could be sending to

1139
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,359
congress sitting on really powerful

1140
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,359
committees have an oversight

1141
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,920
you know be launching a a very strong

1142
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
career for the long term in the country

1143
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,160
that can have a huge impact so uh i

1144
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,320
wanted to end uh one lesson before end

1145
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,400
is you know so kind of so what and i

1146
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,240
want to take action here right we have a

1147
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,800
community of infosec experts on all

1148
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,240
sides so what can we do because we're

1149
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,480
all busy and defending our own you know

1150
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,400
enterprises and have our own jobs but

1151
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,200
first

1152
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,119
simply just work or volunteer on local

1153
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,400
campaigns

1154
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160
even just the really basic stuff like i

1155
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,079
said like you know getting people on

1156
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,480
using you know gmail even microsoft both

1157
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
of them have free services available for

1158
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,160
political campaigns you know just

1159
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,240
setting up basic services getting them

1160
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,800
to use yuba keys um just your really

1161
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,720
really basic stuff doesn't take that

1162
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,400
much time out of your day

1163
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,160
help gives you that nice fuzzy feeling

1164
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,920
of participating and

1165
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,160
you know local democracy and you know

1166
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
getting our civic duty or what a lot of

1167
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,920
people start doing just you know if you

1168
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,839
can for those who can actually work on a

1169
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,160
political campaign um you can take many

1170
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,000
people from tech will take a hiatus if

1171
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,680
they can or or

1172
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,000
you know leave their job to actually go

1173
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,400
do security for larger campaigns during

1174
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
campaign cycles and there's also been a

1175
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,880
lot more stuff there's been some

1176
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,160
interesting security tools have been

1177
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
developed in the open source community

1178
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,920
political campaigns so there's a lot

1179
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,200
that can be done there

1180
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,119
again especially as as you know policy

1181
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,880
becomes a larger and larger issue and

1182
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,400
you know i know the policy village of

1183
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,599
defcon

1184
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,040
kind of got off the ground last year and

1185
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,480
we hope that there's more coming this

1186
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,560
year we want to continue to educate our

1187
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,800
law makers and our elected officials not

1188
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
only about the threat but also all these

1189
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,079
gaps on

1190
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,000
you know lower down uh you know down

1191
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,320
ballot uh campaigns right

1192
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,720
jurisdiction question the statute

1193
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,599
question how should we treat someone who

1194
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,280
achieves some sort of negative

1195
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,079
adverse impact on a

1196
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,760
campaign right we don't want to have

1197
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
cfia type rules where we can't like

1198
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
press f12 in certain states without

1199
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
trying you know trying to be people in

1200
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,960
jail but you know what constitutes like

1201
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,880
real intent versus just you know our

1202
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,400
normal you know scanning testing or you

1203
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,640
know really basic stuff lastly if you

1204
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
just uh the really easy out is just you

1205
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,160
know foresight we're always looking for

1206
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,000
volunteers we have a lot of campaigns to

1207
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,119
work with

1208
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,880
we try to have fun with it

1209
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,480
and again pretty much all we do is free

1210
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,240
it's all volunteer so i'm not paid my

1211
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,560
partner i'm tax isn't paid

1212
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,920
so we're just trying to you know spend

1213
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,520
some of our free time making making the

1214
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,200
country a little bit more secure

1215
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,560
and then there's just one thing if

1216
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
people can um

1217
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,000
amuse me for a sec while i get up on a

1218
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,560
soapbox real quick uh before i i open

1219
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,040
stuff for q a is i also sometimes get

1220
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
this and we all probably know some of

1221
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,320
these folks oh but i don't really care

1222
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,839
about politics politics is really my

1223
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,599
thing i'm just going to focus on doing

1224
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,599
my little infosec thing over here

1225
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,520
and and i just have to say on soapbox

1226
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,680
like everything is politics right if you

1227
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,200
care about privacy and you're in this

1228
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
room make you care about politics if you

1229
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,720
care about security policy and

1230
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,920
regulation

1231
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,240
care about politics if you care about

1232
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,560
legalizing marijuana or abortion or the

1233
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,000
first amendment or what's going on in

1234
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,800
russian ukraine you care about politics

1235
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,880
and these local elected officials that

1236
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
may start out in your neighborhood area

1237
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,560
or at the state level

1238
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
that you there might not be voting for

1239
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,440
or you know may not be uh you know

1240
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,640
aren't thinking of necessarily going to

1241
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,240
support these are the people who are

1242
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,760
going to end up making these decisions

1243
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,599
decisions in however many years when

1244
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,280
they move up the ladder and get elected

1245
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,119
at the federal level so i really i

1246
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,880
really just uh this is this obama

1247
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,560
soapbox moment of like everything is

1248
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,240
politics and so

1249
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,160
especially as infosec professionals we

1250
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,000
have a lot of this knowledge we have the

1251
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,520
ability to make

1252
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
an impact and to educate a wide swath of

1253
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,720
this really critical sector if you will

1254
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,680
that is really uh has an outdoor ins a

1255
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,560
outside impact on our on our work right

1256
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,960
we think about end-to-end encryption

1257
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,640
all these other things we talk about

1258
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,720
putting making sure we have uh cyber

1259
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,079
literate elected officials is super

1260
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,160
important and one great way to get there

1261
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,760
is to work on their campaigns and make

1262
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,200
sure they know about what threats are

1263
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,800
out there and what they can do

1264
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,560
and why this stuff is so important so it

1265
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,400
really doesn't take uh too much time out

1266
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,800
of our our normal lives um so i highly

1267
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
recommend especially in this 2022

1268
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,119
midterm cycle reach out to your local

1269
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,200
campaigns um no one's going to say no

1270
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,240
everyone's a little bit suspicious when

1271
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,839
you say hey i want to help with free

1272
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,680
cyber services

1273
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
so you know but at the end of the day

1274
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,520
you know you meet someone in person over

1275
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,480
a zoom

1276
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,440
especially if you can offer your

1277
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,960
services for free or discounted rate

1278
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,800
they're not going to charge our full

1279
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,319
private sector ir rates uh or whatnot

1280
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,839
everyone's going to say yes and people

1281
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,760
will be glad to have have you in to help

1282
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
out and again just a really great way

1283
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,119
give back to to our country and make

1284
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,400
sure we have a well-functioning

1285
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,720

1289
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,800
this time uh in san diego i know people

1290
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,839

hitting the beach or getting drinks so

1292
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,880

okay i see we have some questions

1308
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,119
here from discord all right

1309
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,960
i've worked in a state uh election

1310
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,720
office for 20 years the designation of

1311
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,000
elections as criminal infrastructure

1312
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,319
2017 has been a game changer for state

1313
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,400
and local jurisdictions do you think the

1314
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,079
effects of that designation has trickled

1315
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,319
down to the campaigns this is a

1316
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,599
fantastic question and just for

1317
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,480
background critical infrastructure and i

1318
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,839
deal with this a lot especially as i

1319
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,720
mentioned my normal uh day job is an

1320
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,359
important designation that can get

1321
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,359
money authorities funding better support

1322
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,359
from the government etc

1323
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,119
thus far from what i've seen a lot of

1324
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,560
this uh kind of like that slide about

1325
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,720
what we normally think about

1326
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,880
securing elections it's really focused

1327
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,560
on you know secretaries of state and

1328
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
their offices and securing election

1329
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,880
systems which again super important i

1330
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,319
have not seen this go down to the

1331
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,000
political political campaigns because

1332
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,920
they're not tied to governments right

1333
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,520
they're almost like little mini startups

1334
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,040
they get their information from their

1335
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
local committees and even the the

1336
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,640
committees like on the democratic

1337
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,480
republican side are often private

1338
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,599
entities

1339
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,040
so they don't really fall under the same

1340
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,560
auspices and they're not really getting

1341
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,079
a lot of support from government or from

1342
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,960
other places

1343
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,920
so again most most political campaigns

1344
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,200
we see it's

1345
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,640
you know they just get these checklists

1346
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,240
and it's go do whatever or maybe one

1347
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,839
person happens to do something in tech

1348
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,440
beforehand and that person becomes a

1349
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
dedicated i.t tech security person on

1350
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,200
the campaign so i think that's a great

1351
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,599
point of if we're able to extend that

1352
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,839
protection or that designation to

1353
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,680
political campaigns have to think about

1354
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,520
that logistically

1355
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,960
that might make a bit a bit of a

1356
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,319
difference but right now it's really

1357
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,680
just focused at the government level at

1358
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,280
the state level state government level

1359
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,560
on protecting their election

1360
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,800
infrastructure

1361
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,440
another question the issues uh that the

1362
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,680
campaign i had in 2018 of not knowing

1363
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,000
who how who or how to report to

1364
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
do i think that's gotten better in 2022

1365
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,079
the campaigns know that information

1366
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,480
i don't think it's gotten much easier i

1367
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,680
still don't necessarily know what the

1368
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,200
right answer is or who would help

1369
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,440
support um usually when we work with

1370
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,119
campaigns we say hey reach out to us and

1371
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,280
we'll figure out what uh kind of where

1372
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,440
to go from there most campaigns have no

1373
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,880
idea

1374
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,119
so they don't know about scissors this

1375
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,880
is also fairly new this is again also

1376
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
not a law enforcement agency

1377
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,640
really will just you know scissor will

1378
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,880
help kind of collect um information to

1379
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,480
see if there are larger trends going on

1380
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,839
for example

1381
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,319
fbi a lot of people are afraid to reach

1382
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,720
out to fbi for various reasons

1383
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,319
or just they they don't even realize

1384
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,079
that the fbi would even care about their

1385
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,000
small political campaign

1386
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,560
dhs also has other little

1387
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,240
you know cyber components across the

1388
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,079
agencies that do some of this work so

1389
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,280
the short answer is no i don't think

1390
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,960
it's gone any easier

1391
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,960
i i don't think it's clear you know some

1392
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,240
if you're in a city like you're in new

1393
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,079
york you've got new york cyber command

1394
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,640
or la chicago i think have some kind of

1395
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,359
city-wide uh security teams and even

1396
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,359
some other states too most of you i

1397
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,680
don't even know which states have

1398
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,359
all the states that have local cyber

1399
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,359
security support

1400
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,040
so that that's a another thing i think

1401
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,119
would be low-hanging fruit

1402
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,720
either for the government or for states

1403
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,640
or even if someone out there

1404
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,920
built a nice little web app that says

1405
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,000
hey i put in my zip code and or my state

1406
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,160
and based on that here all of the you

1407
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,079
know federal state local security

1408
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,839
resources i can reach out to that's a

1409
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,520
huge win and if somebody ends up doing

1410
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,960
that i've had some ideas so feel free to

1411
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,800
reach out

1412
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
um and those are all the q and a's i'm

1413
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,079
seeing in the chats

1414
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,400
here's a different one from the q a how

1415
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,560
the hd double hockey sticks do you get

1416
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,400
people to use a password manager you

1417
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,760
have to walk them through several

1418
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,359
passwords

1419
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,119
sometimes yes and sometimes no i think

1420
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,440
the best sell for password managers

1421
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,280
is

1422
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,359
just again telling the story of how easy

1423
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,960
it is right instead of saying you're

1424
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,800
doing passwords wrong install this

1425
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,119
software that's going to be uh kind of

1426
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,720
hard to use at first

1427
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,599
i tell people hey i have a tool that

1428
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,720
makes you know i don't have to think

1429
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
about passwords anymore i don't have to

1430
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,079
create passwords i don't have to

1431
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,760
remember my passwords i don't even have

1432
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,920
to write them into my browser or without

1433
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,000
my phone anymore and that usually gets

1434
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,640
people their eyebrows oh crap i hate

1435
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,240
passwords and everyone yells at me for

1436
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,160
them what tool can i use to make me

1437
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,079
never worry about passwords and

1438
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,680
sometimes just to show you know i have

1439
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,280
an iphone here i'll even show them the

1440
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,200
whole integration with you know your

1441
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,040
last pass or one password and links to

1442
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,200
your face id and i think that was some

1443
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,440
some you know great user design on

1444
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,680
apple's uh behalf and and not that i'm

1445
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,920
endorsing them i just i know ios much

1446
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,760
better than android but again just

1447
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,000
showing those bits make it a lot easier

1448
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,760
um and then yes sometimes you do have to

1449
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,359
walk people through or we'll handle the

1450
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,680
setup on the back end um and then again

1451
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,920
the really easy followable guides makes

1452
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,680
a big difference and like anything else

1453
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,680
people need one or two reps and they're

1454
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,880
usually good to go from there but again

1455
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,680
you have to

1456
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,960
you have to talk just a general thing

1457
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,000
not just in security but you have to

1458
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,839
think about the frame of the audience

1459
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,839
that you're trying to connect with right

1460
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,440
i'm if i just think about everything in

1461
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,880
my frame i'm going to talk about threats

1462
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,040
and adversaries and security and

1463
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,200
the ttps that's not how they think they

1464
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
think about passwords suck and i hate

1465
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,040
them and i don't remem i remember them

1466
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,599
all the time um so what can i do to make

1467
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,640
my life less crappy thanks to passports

1468
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,880
and who can speak to them in that way

1469
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,000
you'll end up getting a lot better

1470
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,079
update i'll try to stick around discord

1471
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,440
sorry i've been running around and back

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,880
i don't think he can hear me and i don't

1485
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,319
think you can

1486
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,680
hear me

1487
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,880
i want to i want to thank dan because we

1488
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,040
in the state of michigan are using some

1489
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,920
of the

1490
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,880
some of the information he has we've got

1491
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
a part of the the offshoot of the

1492
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,119
volunteers that i manage the reactive

1493
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,839
part we have a proactive part in in

1494
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,760
michigan called cyber partners that

1495
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,119
works with local and regional

1496
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,079
governments some of those run elections

1497
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,680
and so we've been working with folks

1498
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,359
like dan uh to try and educate the local

1499
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,160
county clerks because these folks like

1500
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,079
county kirk can get elected without

1501
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,119
knowing how the election is run they do

1502
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,280
a lot of other stuff so they can get

1503
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,760
elected and pretty shortly have to run

1504
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,240
an election and they don't always

1505
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,319
have the background to be able to defend

1506
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,880
themselves against uh concerned citizens

1507
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,559
so we're going to try and go out and do

1508
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,160
an education effort and that is going to

1509
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,480
use some of our cyber volunteers this

1510
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
might be an effort i don't know if this

1511
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,839
effort is going on in your state

1512

chance as cyber defenders to to be in

1517
