8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,279
it's uh

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,920

so let me see um we're supposed to be

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,920
like these old fogies telling stories so

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,120
let me uh

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,000
let me let me let me

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,120
let me give something that dates me in

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,239
the field of computing

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,440
oh

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
uh i was doing information security when

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,320
ed still had hair on his head

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,239
how many people

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,040
uh

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,080
do information security when i had hair

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
thank you

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,119
josh didn't have hair at the time as i

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,360
recall

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,240
ah yeah um

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,840
all right so i'm gonna pass the mic down

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
and let people introduce themselves i

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,119
think it's probably the best way to do

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,720
it so is that how we're doing this now

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
we're gonna introduce ourselves and tell

41
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
them how old we are well you know i just

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
want them to respect our authority and

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,880
okay all right so

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,320
uh melissa miller uh boy i'm old enough

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
that i actually worked on a zenith heath

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,640
kit not for work i mean i was four years

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,320
old but okay

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,720
um and my first hack here here's where i

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,560
find out how old everybody in the room

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
is

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,880
my first hacks were on prodigy

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,720
oh yeah oh yeah

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,720
computer

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,719
yeah right right all right see

55
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,840
some of them know what we're talking

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
about so that's a good start

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,600
wow

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
i feel even older than i did a minute

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,199
ago

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,639
so as the elder statesman i think of

61
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,480
this group i can say without uh

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
correction and i'm proud of my age by

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,360
the way at this point at 66. um so i'm

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
at 45 years in cyber security now

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,239
long before there was such a thing

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,680
crypto math at the national security

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,080
agency back in the mid 70s

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,120
uh to date myself i

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,080
uh took the only computer science course

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
my college offered

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,080
and it was the most miserable experience

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,239
all right if i say letters like tso jcl

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,200
all right some of you know what i'm

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,239
talking about

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,519
be really nice to the guy behind the

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,440
counter so you could get two runs in a

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,319
day

78
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,160
and that took some serious schmooze to

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,280
get that

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,840
uh and the computer wizard that i got to

81
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
know in my first summer job

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
was so he was such a wizard he got to

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
use a 300 baht acoustic coupler to call

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,200
dial into the mainframe all right some

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
of you know with that anyway so i i go

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,800
back long before there was sort of any

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,959
notion of this industry as we know it

88
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,000
but uh

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,840
so got to ride the wave that we now call

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,360
cyber and uh maybe some of that will

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,599
come out in a bit so thank you

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
wow i cannot do that that was awesome

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
yeah so uh i'm ed ed scotus uh founder

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,400
of counter hack security got the team up

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,799
here it's good to see you um required

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:25,920
thing there

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,799
is it required i don't know they're

98
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,480
taking this is all

99
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,799
that's right exactly we're watching

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,879
write down the names yeah exactly write

101
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,480
down the names lynn take the names

102
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280
um

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
so i go back a ways i remember before

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
sans had tracks and it was a series of

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
90-minute talks all day long so i

106
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,480
remember that my first computer was a

107
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,200
vic-20 anybody here have a vic-20 5

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,920
whopping k of ram do you remember that

109
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,439
they had a thing on twitter the other

110
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,519
day what was your first video game

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,640
console

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,840
i of course am looking for atari 2600

113
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,879
right right it's not even in the list

114
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
they started like with this nintendo

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,040
thing and it's like whatever right

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,239
remember before the 2600 was a 2600 it

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,840
was a vcs did you ever have

118
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,200
pong when i was a young child we had

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,320
pong so um but anyway that's happy to

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,120
have it

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,680
it was amazing there's like a video game

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
on your tv

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,280
yeah but uh you know i think each of us

124
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
has learned a lot of lessons over the

125
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,880
years and we'd like to share those with

126
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,400
you

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
maybe you know to help provide some

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
guidance or at least some fun stories

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,360
right so i'll hand it back to hal

130
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,040
so you know just this morning uh before

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
class got started i was talking with the

132
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,320
folks in my classroom and we were kind

133
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
of saying like

134
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,960
some days it feels like security

135
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,600
groundhog day you know it's like we see

136
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,360
the same

137
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
mistakes happening over and over again

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
um you know

139
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,039
and maybe it's a generational thing

140
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,880
where we're not passing along the

141
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
knowledge um

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,759
but it seems like you know we're living

143
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,199
in this world we're like hey look

144
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
suddenly directory traversal attacks are

145
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
happening again and things like that and

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,400
so

147
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,520
i think what with the purpose here is is

148
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
for us to

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,400
talk about

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,639
our experience in the cyber security

151
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,919
realm and

152
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,240
in some cases mistakes that we have made

153
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,960
um and and

154
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,039
what did we take away from that but but

155
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,680
more to the point how do we

156
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,440
how do we pass on that knowledge right

157
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,960
how do we

158
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,199
get that

159
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,320
security genetics or security dna

160
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,960
passed on to the the next generation

161
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,919
right

162
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,120
because i sometimes feel like we're

163
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,919
failing at that i feel like people we

164
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,560
leave the industry and we don't pass on

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,000
pass on the knowledge right so how do we

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,199
scale that

167
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,319
um

168
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,919
anybody want anybody brave enough to

169
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,880
start with the first story

170
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
melissa's looking at me like oh hell no

171
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
tony said he brought enough stories for

172
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,039
the whole hour i'm sorry

173
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,960
all right tony raise the scene

174
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
now technically i said i did made enough

175
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
mistakes for the whole hour because i

176
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,400
could talk about it but but i'll tell

177
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
you just some of this echoes actually i

178
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
was listening to doc's talk previously

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
and some of it really resonates right in

180
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,960
in the the role that we play and i grew

181
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
up in this role

182
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
uh so i spent 35 years at the national

183
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
security agency in again what's now

184
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,160
known as cyber defense for defense so

185
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
big sig it machine right that's 90 of

186
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
the agency little lonely 10 defender

187
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,400
that's where i spent my career

188
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,479
because i love a hopeless cause and

189
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,639
defense is the ultimate hopeless cause

190
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,440
right

191
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
but you know there was a lot of learning

192
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,199
there and the mistake of the sort of

193
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,840
cultural mistake that i uh

194
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
was was brought in

195
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,240
was you'd hire you know clever young

196
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
people

197
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
and we'd mock attack our own u.s

198
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
algorithms uh randomization you know and

199
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
then it became software systems products

200
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
and looking for zero days right

201
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
and there was a notion

202
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,919
if we just pointed out these problems

203
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,400
people would either be so scared or so

204
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,639
inspired or so impressed they would go

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,639
fix them

206
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,400
that never happened in my entire career

207
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,319
not at any scale

208
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,560
right we spent i mean some of the most

209
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,479
clever people i have ever met right with

210
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,240
the most clever ideas to attack systems

211
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,160
and you know something might get fixed

212
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
but it never got to the root cause and

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
that was so

214
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
disappointing at some point i realized

215
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
this it's not fun finding the same

216
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
problems over and over again and it took

217
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,240
me a long time to figure it out but i'll

218
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
share one quick story about red and blue

219
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
teamings i was at i was part of the

220
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
start of what was known as blue teams in

221
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
nsa that was probably 94 95

222
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,479
when things became sort of codified

223
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
anyone remember the first big government

224
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,120
hack

225
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,639
the um

226
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,319
defacing of janet reno's picture on the

227
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,560
department of justice right and remember

228
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,039
that uh i guess which federal agency

229
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,520
wound up sending a cleanup team along

230
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
meeting so

231
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
and guess how that team was formed can

232
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
anybody spell solaris in the room here

233
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,039
quick you're on the team get down there

234
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
there was no notion of this sort of

235
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,919
codified organized and so forth so blue

236
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,080
teaming red teaming came up very late

237
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,879
90s really became a thing

238
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,560
but at that time right so this is idea

239
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,840
we were finding problems in u.s

240
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,800
systems for the purpose of telling the

241
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,160
decision maker hey you got a problem and

242
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,680
they'd be you know again maybe they'd be

243
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
inspired to go fix this thing

244
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,839
so the blue team worked for me at one

245
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,120
point and the red team worked for a navy

246
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
captain down the hall and they found a

247
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,799
problem big deal

248
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,479
big thing across the dod

249
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,039
briefed everywhere super hush hush we

250
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,839
got to protect this it's a dod system

251
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,760
we've got to protect this information

252
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
who got tasked to go fix the problem the

253
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,760
blue team that worked for me so i go

254
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
knock on the door the navy captain

255
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
opened the door hey my team is tasked to

256
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
go fix this can we get a briefing on

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
what you found

258
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,920
no

259
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
close hold

260
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,800
the guy at the pentagon the senior of

261
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,279
the pentagon said no we cannot reveal

262
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,640
this information because it's a live

263
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,959
operational vulnerability uh well how

264
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,480
how do i get invited to a meeting i

265
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,240
can't believe this guy's an idiot he

266
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
wants this thing fixed

267
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,000
right but that was the culture of the

268
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
time that is the

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,279
finding of problems was so sensitive

270
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,959
you know what we did we didn't we didn't

271
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,040
hold back the bad guys right they they

272
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,560
knew the technology that we were using

273
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
they had already done the recon they

274
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,399
knew what were critical systems we

275
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,160
crippled the defense for a decade or

276
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,560
more because we could not figure out

277
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,320
how just to share information about this

278
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,640
right that is we didn't see the finding

279
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,399
as part of the solution we saw it as

280
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,800
kind of a separate decision trigger that

281
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
would happen so i made a vow at that

282
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,279
moment because i was moving up in

283
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,440
management at that point i said someday

284
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,120
both the red and the team blue team will

285
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
work for me

286
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
and i'm going to put them under the same

287
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,040
navy captain and his measure of success

288
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,600
is what gets fixed not what gets found

289
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
and uh yes that did happen

290
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,600
later in my career so that was my you

291
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
know sort of mistakes that i saw and

292
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,640
made and helped help correct i think

293
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,920
so

294
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,839
sorry what's funny is that that still

295
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
happens today by the way and it's not a

296
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,360
government thing

297
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
okay private industry you know

298
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,720
who's the first people you call when you

299
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,880
have a breach the lawyers and what are

300
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,079
the lawyers there to do that they're

301
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,040
gonna establish privilege

302
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,200
so that still happens but you were

303
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
talking about you know doc's talk before

304
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,959
and doc touched on a couple things that

305
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,560
are like really important and it's you

306
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,920
know you kind of went there with like

307
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,880
this whole idea of fud right and i

308
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
one thing doc didn't say and i was

309
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,320
hoping he was gonna touch on we had that

310
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,920
quote up there about don't you know

311
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,640
don't waste a breach

312
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,480
you can waste the breach just as easily

313
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
by going in with all that fud and like

314
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,000
oh my god this is so horrible

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
everything's awful because we think that

316
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
that's the thing that's going to get

317
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,440
people going

318
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,519
and it doesn't right i mean it's never

319
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,360
worked it doesn't work we love to talk

320
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,720
about that stuff between us because we

321
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,079
all understand it it has a lot of

322
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,839
context for us it doesn't have context

323
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,839
when we go to the executives

324
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
but

325
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
you know it put me a really interesting

326
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,040
position

327
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
where

328
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
i have a cio who is

329
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,600
one of these technology folks who really

330
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,880
sees himself he just believes he knows

331
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,600
he's got the head for cyber right he i

332
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
know security

333
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
he he reads you know different things he

334
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,519
probably reads like brian krebs and

335
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,320
whatever but

336
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
we'll go into this board meeting

337
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,200
and he now stop me if you've heard this

338
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,880
one before

339
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,279
it's not if you get breached it's when

340
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,800
how many of y'all have said that

341
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,320
seriously like how many of you all have

342
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,800
said that say i i'm guilty as charged

343
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,600
too

344
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,360
so

345
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,800
think about this for a minute you're

346
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,639
going into a meeting with your board

347
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,880
you're asking them for more money for

348
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,800
your security investment and you stand

349
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,599
up there and you say

350
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,360
it's not if you get breached it's when

351
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
and i wanted to high-five the board

352
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
member who turned right around me like

353
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
on the spot perfect and says

354
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,920
so what you're telling me is you want

355
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,399
more money to protect us from the

356
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,040
breaches that you can't stop that are

357
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
inevitable

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,839
yeah that's pretty much what he just

359
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,360
said wanted to high five them until i

360
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,079
realized like a split second later that

361
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,800
now i had this mess to clean up like

362
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
great my cio goes in there and you're

363
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
just talking about this program we're

364
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
trying to build and hey yeah you know

365
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,519
you got to give us all this money we're

366
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,560
going to protect you from getting

367
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,279
breaches but it you're going to get

368
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,399
breached

369
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,560
so i mean that that's where the and

370
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
that's not new

371
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,760
all right we do that all the time so

372
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,680
you know when doc was up here that was

373
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,200
that was the thing that kept coming back

374
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,360
to me was that story like

375
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,600
man i just

376
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
we really need to

377
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,959
you know we can tell the war stories we

378
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,320
can come up here and talk about all the

379
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,760
old technology and stuff and everything

380
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,040
else but when we're talking about how do

381
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
we move this to the next generation i

382
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,760
think we really have to start with

383
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
those lessons that we learned about when

384
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,600
we're in those audiences how we

385
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,120
communicate that

386
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,000
because it is our job is to make sure

387
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
that we give them the decision making

388
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,240
so

389
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,079
you know given the information they need

390
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,200
to make those decisions if they're

391
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
making the wrong decisions that's on us

392
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,959
and i can't tell you how many times i

393
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,480
get blasted on twitter when i challenge

394
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,680
somebody on that i'm like well if you're

395
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
pissed at your management

396
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,959
it's your fault so

397
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,120
and i think to tony's point is how do

398
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,480
you motivate

399
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,639
proper behavior right you thought oh

400
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,639
just finding it you know people would be

401
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,760
embarrassed enough that it would

402
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
motivate the the fixing behavior uh

403
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,519
that's not the way it works right so how

404
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,360
do we how do we motivate

405
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,760
motivate that behavior my experience at

406
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,600
the executive level i do a lot of

407
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,199
incident response work

408
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,720
and um

409
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,600
i was uh we were we were on an ir we're

410
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,040
kind of at the end of the ir you know

411
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,120
when you're you're teeing up the great

412
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
shock and awe event where you you you

413
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
push the attacker out of the network and

414
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,279
everybody's at the end of the rope

415
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,880
they're kind of burned out and i'm we're

416
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,399
sitting in the conference room the

417
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,160
consulting group i'm working with and

418
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,959
the

419
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,959
cto of the company

420
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,160
and um really really nice lady totally

421
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
on our side been helping us every step

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,160
of the investigation she you know she

423
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
says really thanks all of you all for

424
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,880
helping us out in this difficult time

425
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
looks like we're going to get everything

426
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,480
under control and we'll be able to move

427
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,279
on with our business

428
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,399
and i

429
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,440
stopped for a moment i said um

430
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,480
maybe we didn't exactly make this clear

431
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
you're dealing with uh

432
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,320
advanced persistent threats

433
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,519
um

434
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,440
and they did not get what they

435
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,560
came for so they'll be back this was

436
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,839
round one of a battle one of a long war

437
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,800
and

438
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
i i never actually had seen this before

439
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,720
but like her face literally went white

440
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,199
like all the blood drained from her face

441
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,399
she's like

442
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,440
what

443
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,399
um

444
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,959
so so the communication

445
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,040
that hadn't happened was

446
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
this isn't the end right what you what

447
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
you've just won as a as a lovely prize

448
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,920
for this event is

449
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
the ongoing knowledge that you have to

450
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
maintain

451
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
your your state of security at a much

452
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,839
higher level than than than you were

453
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,880
before

454
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,399
and and that is something that i think

455
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,839
we're also not very good at

456
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,759
communicating we

457
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,320
tend to see breaches as isolated events

458
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,160
and we we don't

459
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,800
give organizations a sense of security

460
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,320
continuity

461
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
um

462
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,720
around around these events um

463
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
and you know shame on us i think for for

464
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
messaging that badly

465
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,199
right

466
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,439
so

467
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
so hal was just talking about incident

468
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,000
response and communication i'd like to

469
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
move to the pen test side of things any

470
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,199
pen testers here show of hands cool so

471
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,320
um

472
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
i don't want to embarrass anybody from

473
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
our team or myself here but it was a

474
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,720
mistake we almost made and i see the

475
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
mistake being made a lot so when we do a

476
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
pen test we work on reports and we pour

477
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,600
everything we've got into creating

478
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,120
really good reports

479
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,360
we have multiple levels of review

480
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,800
when a report is done by a couple of

481
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,560
engineers it usually goes to josh wright

482
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,320
josh wave to the people

483
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
and josh helps hammer it out and such

484
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
and then it comes to me sometimes it

485
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,360
goes to patrick or lynn as well comes to

486
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,880
me and i read through the report as well

487
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,639
so i'm reading through this report that

488
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,800
we had written for a pen test

489
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,040
and i'm reading this one finding

490
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,279
originally discovered by an engineer

491
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,399
passed to josh passed to me and i don't

492
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,759
understand it i mean i'm reading this

493
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,360
thing it's like it's in greek or

494
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
something i it makes no sense i mean i

495
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,040
mean it looks interesting i assume of

496
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,279
course that i'm an idiot obviously these

497
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,120
very smart people far smarter than me

498
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,679
must know what this means but i'm the

499
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,039
avatar of the ultimate client reader

500
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
maybe a non-technical person at all

501
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,640
and i don't understand this so very

502
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
sheepishly i reach out to josh and say

503
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,839
josh you know finding

504
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,000
2.7 i don't understand what that means

505
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,679
and josh says to me

506
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,359
no offense josh but he says you know

507
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,039
what i never really understood that one

508
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,119
either

509
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,440
so so josh says i'll i'll hand it back

510
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
to the engineer that originally found it

511
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,679
and and and we'll take care of it right

512
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,600
so josh hands it back to the engine i

513
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,720
won't name him

514
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
and he says to josh you know i never

515
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
really understood that thing either

516
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,160
i you know it they looked interesting it

517
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,919
seemed kind of scary so i kind of wrote

518
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,360
up what was happening but you know

519
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,679
what's the real risk and i don't know so

520
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,039
so the three of us get on the phone

521
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,880
together and i'm like we can't deliver

522
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
this to the customer if none of us

523
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
really understands the implication of

524
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,120
this fi i agree it's a finding but we

525
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,200
got to turn it into something

526
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,960
and so we did and delivered that to the

527
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
customer but i read a lot of pen test

528
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,799
reports not only the ones from our team

529
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,160
but some of the ones maybe you've

530
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,760
written i do a lot of expert witness

531
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,679
work and i see a lot of pen test reports

532
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,240
from a lot of pen test companies and i

533
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,760
have that experience a lot where i'm

534
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,000
reading a finding in a pentest report

535
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
and i say i have no idea what this means

536
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,720
and i'll bet you the customer

537
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,440
who

538
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
requisitioned this pen test probably has

539
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
no idea what it means and maybe the

540
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,440
engineer who discovered it has no idea

541
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,160
what it really means right so if you are

542
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
a pen tester i challenge you to look at

543
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,919
your reports and think really deeply do

544
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,440
you really know what this vulnerability

545
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,600
is i'm not talking you know nessus or

546
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,320
qualis or uh you know one of the other

547
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,160
scanning tools discovered a flaw that

548
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,000
you have to patch i'm saying this is a

549
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,400
fundamental really interesting behavior

550
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
that looks risky

551
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,799
and

552
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,360
has security implications think through

553
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,720
that try to explain it well so that you

554
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,200
can communicate the true risk and try to

555
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
drive the behavior of fixing it not so

556
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,280
that the ultimate person who has to

557
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,840
defend says i don't understand this so

558
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
therefore it must not be that important

559
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,679
so it's a lesson that we learn and kind

560
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,600
of grapple with all the time do we

561
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,919
really understand these findings and are

562
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
we communicating them in a way that

563
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,559
properly represents the risk to drive

564
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,480
the behavior tony was talking about

565
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,080
earlier that is let's make this thing

566
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
more secure

567
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
yeah that's great

568
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,480
i mean you know probably

569
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,880
the reason this perpetuates this thing

570
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
you describe is what most organizations

571
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
do is they receive the pentest report

572
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
from you they weigh it they pay you by

573
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,559
the pound and then they stick it in a

574
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,480
drawer and never look at it right i mean

575
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,440
so

576
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
that's you know that's why you get away

577
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,799
with you know putting in findings that

578
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,480
nobody understands because nobody reads

579
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,840
them right

580
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
we want to make them compelling and

581
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
right i know yeah

582
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,400
by the time

583
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,760
by the pound yeah new pricing mod

584
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,960
um

585
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,200
so okay so

586
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,720
we're all good at

587
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,840
articulating problems like mistakes that

588
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,880
we're making

589
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,440
success stories any any any of you like

590
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,320
managed to like turn this around

591
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,559
in or done something that you found

592
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,000
successful

593
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,400
so here's one

594
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
and i started this a little while ago in

595
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,039
my my incident response uh practice

596
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,440
what i find when we get involved in an

597
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,720
incident i'm third-party incident

598
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,400
responder i come into organizations on

599
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,919
the worst day ever

600
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,480
and i meet with the it team i meet with

601
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
the security team i meet with the

602
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
executives right

603
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,960
and everybody's like all pissed off and

604
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
uh everybody's like retreated into their

605
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,280
own bunker because they're just waiting

606
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
you know for the blame bombs to start

607
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,720
dropping right it's like whose fault is

608
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
this

609
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
so you have this this call at the

610
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,440
beginning of these irs and everybody's

611
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,360
on the call

612
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
and i started the call and i said look

613
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,440
here's what's going to happen

614
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,120
i'm not psychic i just do this all the

615
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,919
time right here's what's going to happen

616
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,679
we're going to we're going to do our due

617
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,520
diligence we're going to track this

618
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
incident back to

619
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,559
the the

620
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,960
system where it all started for you all

621
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,840
and

622
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,760
it's going to be

623
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
some machine on the perimeter of your

624
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,919
network one of your firewalls one of

625
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,919
your vpn appliances

626
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,320
do you have on-premises exchange oh it's

627
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,439
that machine okay

628
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,440
and what we're going to find when we get

629
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
there is that that device whatever it

630
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,880
was wasn't up to date on patches

631
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,080
and or whatever right and there was an

632
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,480
it wasn't a magic zero day it was some

633
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,200
known vulnerability right

634
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,360
and whose fault is that

635
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,960
i say

636
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
i'll tell you whose fault it is it's the

637
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,480
fault of the who used that

638
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,880
vulnerability to break into your network

639
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,640
and by the way i use the word

640
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
it's the fault of the who used

641
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
that vulnerability to break into your

642
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,440
network and drop ransomware everywhere

643
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,559
right that is ultimately who's at fault

644
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,280
here that is the enemy that is the

645
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,440
person that we are all collectively

646
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
working together

647
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
to fight right

648
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
we're not pointing guns at each other in

649
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
here right

650
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,840
guns face outward right so because blame

651
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,480
i find in an incident is the single

652
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,720
biggest demotivator

653
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,120
for for the organization everybody's

654
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
like watching their backside

655
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,720
because they don't want to be the one

656
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,960
who gets you know shot

657
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,039
um and and

658
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,280
it actually can hurt the investigation

659
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,760
because people will end up hiding

660
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
information that they think you know is

661
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,640
incriminating

662
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,000
or possibly career limiting for them so

663
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you know my biggest success was kind of

664
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,679
trying to defuse

665
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,600
the the blame game at the beginning and

666
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
say look

667
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
it's nobody's fault except the person

668
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,120
who caused us all to be here okay all

669
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,280
right

670
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,000
i'm gonna follow and you might have your

671
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,919
mind if i tell a story about you hal

672
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,360
you know the story

673
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,720
do you remember

674
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,120
well it's a little much well i once read

675
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,679
something if you remember many years ago

676
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,280
i called you i think back when we used

677
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,600
telephones to call to see if i could i'd

678
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,039
read something you wrote and i asked if

679
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,320
i could use it because it caught me at

680
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,679
the perfect moment and here's the

681
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,559
problem

682
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,720
i think in this industry we spend way

683
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,799
too much time either arguing among

684
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,520
ourselves or trying to one-up each other

685
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,919
oh i found umpteen results and we have a

686
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,679
way to fix them oh well i got five more

687
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,520
or ten more

688
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,200
it's unproductive and it's unhelpful and

689
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,880
i was really grappling with that problem

690
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,159
i read something at hall right so i

691
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,840
called him because you ever see a quote

692
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,039
that's so good you wish you had said it

693
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,039
first right well this was one of those

694
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,880
and the quote was roughly this uh in a

695
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,559
blog that you wrote

696
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,480
the the problem with the infosec

697
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,120
business is that the experts agree

698
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,640
on ninety percent of what ought to get

699
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,600
done

700
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,039
but they spend ninety percent of their

701
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,720
time arguing to the death about the last

702
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,000
ten percent

703
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,320
and i said that is the world i live in

704
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,840
that is nuts

705
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,720
right so we let perfection or

706
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
really this rivalry went upmanship

707
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,480
denies

708
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,640
right if i could get 90 of like the

709
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,919
cardiac doctors who looked at me to

710
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,640
agree on something i'm in i i'm going

711
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,600
that way

712
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,360
but we don't accept that in a lot of our

713
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,559
business right because it's about

714
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,919
wizardry and you make your name because

715
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,760
you're more clever than the other person

716
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,159
i call that the security jedi mind trick

717
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,440
people usually do this to me at sandia

718
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
when i have time out there hey we just

719
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
figured out how to fix 90 of the

720
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,960
problems yeah but you didn't fix these

721
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
and i have three more obscure weirdo

722
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
when the moon rises just right scenarios

723
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
that will come

724
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,480
but let's go fix them ninety percent

725
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
let's let's go right and that's and we

726
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,320
 ourselves with that kind of

727
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,159
nonsense so um and you know pardon my

728
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,159
yeah but it's nonsense to me and so i

729
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,240
decided that consensus would become my

730
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
model and how was one of the data points

731
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
to help really crystallize the message

732
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,919
there so the high water mark of that at

733
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,240
that time and people used to say this

734
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
the chief of the red team came to me you

735
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,600
know we're a lot better than the air

736
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,320
force red team

737
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,919
that's not my enemy

738
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
right the enemies out there coming at us

739
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,320
i don't what have you done then if we're

740
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,679
so much better than the air force red

741
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,960
team what have you done to make them

742
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,880
better do they have our tools do they

743
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,559
have our training are we willing to

744
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,000
bring their people in to take tours if

745
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
we're so much doggone better that became

746
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
the start of the dod wide certification

747
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,960
program for red teams across the dod i

748
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,039
opened up everything that we had

749
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,880
we also had that point history anyone

750
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,120
know what a disa stig is configuration

751
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,679
guide right cis benchmark

752
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,360
uh at that time nsa security guys this

753
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,679
is lake 99 2000 2001 2 3 vintage stuff

754
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,679
and there was this like rivalry oh our

755
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,760
stuff is a lot better than this stuff

756
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,480
and

757
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,600
that is not my enemy okay

758
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
what are we doing to bring them together

759
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,080
so i put a team leader in charge i said

760
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,279
here's the rule

761
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,200
no configuration setting is worth

762
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
falling on your sword on all right

763
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,440
us in agreement i wrote this down this

764
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,679
is my five principles for the for this

765
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,840
um and the first one was uh

766
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,080
uh the community in agreement and us 90

767
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,000
happy is better than the community not

768
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,200
in agreement and us 100 happy and by the

769
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,960
way no one that has ever worked for me

770
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,559
has ever been 100 happy with anything

771
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,400
that i did so that's not the target

772
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,120
right

773
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,360
and the idea was to gain consensus among

774
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
all those named players around

775
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,559
configuration guidance the high-water

776
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,200
mark was uh 2003 or four we announced a

777
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
national consensus on the windows

778
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,279
baseline i think hal was you know there

779
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,640
were a lot of great people across the

780
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,720
entire industry that participated but

781
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,039
that was about consensus and get past

782
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,520
this how do we make ourselves look more

783
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
clever than the other people so we can

784
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,279
fight for that last 10 percent that

785
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,120
stuff has irritated me and has become a

786
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,200
driver for the rest of my uh time on

787
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
this industry perfection is the enemy of

788
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,200
completion yeah yes absolutely

789
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,320
why

790
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,400
you just spun that like a there was a

791
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
perfect segway there

792
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,679
because

793
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,440
well yeah i know and i wish i had like

794
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,960
some great humorous story but you wanted

795
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,039
success stories it's like success is no

796
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,000
fun

797
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,720
but i mean i'll i'll give you a success

798
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
story because it talks to what you're

799
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,400
you're just saying about

800
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,840
a lot of what we've talked about up here

801
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,880
actually

802
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,960
you know

803
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,919
that whole like chasing perfection thing

804
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,600
right and and we're gonna get into a

805
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
little bit more i don't wanna spoil the

806
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,480
whole story because someone says

807
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,000
actually i'm going to talk about my my

808
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,279
talk tomorrow

809
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,480
but

810
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,679
you know you get into that breach

811
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,399
situation why do we go into a breach and

812
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,399
you get done you know you're in an ir

813
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,919
situation in this case it's an ir

814
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,240
situation because a log for j right i

815
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
mean how many of us were scrambling

816
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,600
around running around trying to figure

817
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,279
out where we had log4j

818
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,039
right i mean

819
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,720
i'm talking to people four weeks after

820
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,159
that thing dropped and like yeah we're

821
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,440
still not really sure where we have it

822
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
but that's important context because i'm

823
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,520
sitting there and i'm looking at this i

824
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,360
kid you not and this is the whole reason

825
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,159
i'm giving the talk i'm giving tomorrow

826
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,480
i'm sitting there eight hours into our

827
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,399
incident so it's friday night you know

828
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,159
and that thing dropped what thursday

829
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,360
basically

830
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
um late thursday friday was when

831
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,640
everybody actually started paying

832
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,480
attention and caring

833
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,120
as things usually go um

834
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,440
but you know as i'm sitting there

835
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,039
we start an instant eight hours later

836
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,240
i've got a list in my hands of 948

837
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,760
targets across my software platforms

838
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,880
that i've got log4j

839
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,279
well that's pretty damn cool why do i

840
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,360
have that because i'm running sca

841
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,279
we've got you know really nice dev

842
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,480
pipeline we're running white source no

843
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,720
reg on white's horse sneak is just as

844
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,399
cool and i forget who else is in that

845
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,399
space but they're all cool

846
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,200
but so we've got this information

847
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,039
and so you know i'm sitting there

848
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,320
thinking all right this is really this

849
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,159
is cool like oh see the industry is

850
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,440
there and then i'm talking all my

851
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,919
colleagues are like

852
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,080
you have what how did you get that you

853
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,760
know and and that's

854
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,880
you know that's one of those things

855
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,360
where it's like all right

856
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,679
cool we've got this we should build off

857
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,640
of this

858
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,159
but then

859
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,960
i'm talking to the ciso and he's like no

860
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
no we can't let a good breach go to

861
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,480
waste we got to get funding for these

862
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,120
other things and you know sure enough he

863
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,080
goes into some enterprise risk committee

864
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,399
meeting and tells them yeah here's all

865
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,159
the bad things that we've got to fix all

866
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
the holes that we have and you know what

867
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,640
happens they run them out of the room

868
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
literally i mean like literally ran this

869
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,320
guy out of the room and i'm sitting

870
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,559
there i go in the next day because

871
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,960
so just to understand i've got a ciso

872
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,600
who's kind of at that corporate level i

873
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,960
am the be so for my division so i run

874
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,200
vision i have my own boards i report to

875
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
and all that i go to i board meeting i'm

876
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,240
like yeah hey we we had 948 targets we

877
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,600
knew where they were

878
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,080
you know we we built some laugh rules we

879
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,760
put those in place while we started

880
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,039
fixing these whatever and they're like

881
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,799
great

882
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,559
a month later i'm in another meeting

883
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,080
with them and oh yeah here's three

884
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,240
million dollars to go build that new

885
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,159
cyber resiliency practice you asked us

886
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,320
for

887
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
that's a success story

888
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,600
i'm hiring 16 people in two years

889
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,880
because

890
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,559
they trust me because i could go in

891
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,399
there and say hey yeah

892
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,000
did we have to suck some people off of

893
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
some projects and slow some work down

894
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,840
for a while to fix this thing yet did it

895
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,200
suck yeah did we get breached no

896
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,640
not this time

897
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
here's what we did that helped

898
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,360
so i mean that's like when we're talking

899
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,480
success stories that's the kind of

900
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,520
success story you want

901
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,960
here's where all that money you spent

902
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,320
last year went

903
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,360
right exactly but that that's the thing

904
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,279
like that sizzle he had this whole cyber

905
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,039
transformation program thing that they

906
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,120
had spent millions and millions on and

907
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
he goes in there and says yeah all these

908
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,720
holes are the things we found as our

909
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,200
post-mortem and uh yeah those weren't in

910
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,960
that transformation program so i need

911
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
more money he just needed a big zero

912
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,320
trust budget that's on that right yeah

913
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,039
yeah

914
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,000
i mean that's probably where we're

915
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,840
headed eventually

916
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,480
ed i think sure yeah so

917
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,640
i have a story

918
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,519
that had great success early on

919
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,760
and then utter failure toward the end so

920
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,080
that fits right that's good

921
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,519
so we were doing an exercise with the us

922
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,320
military it was the army in particular

923
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,519
and the idea was there would be

924
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,200
a hundred blue teamers all in uniform

925
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,519
battling against our red team josh

926
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,120
wright headed up the red team this was

927
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
about three and a half years ago

928
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,720
and um

929
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,679
we negotiated with them to include in

930
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,320
the scope of red team activities this

931
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,559
infrastructure that represented a small

932
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,320
city with a port and all this kind of

933
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,919
stuff

934
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,720
but we also included in the scope

935
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,440
the kits that the army used that they

936
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,760
would actually you know conduct real

937
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,320
operations on that was a really

938
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,559
game-changing factor that we could

939
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,279
attack their actual kits all right so

940
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,679
they deployed i mean this was a full up

941
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,320
military exercise they landed on

942
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,159
blackhawk helicopters they brought all

943
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,240
their kits in they set it up for a

944
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,559
couple of days josh got the red teamers

945
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,880
so there's a hundred blue teamers all

946
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,760
you know trained we had i think five red

947
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,480
teamers and a whole campaign mapped out

948
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
we were gonna hit him over the space of

949
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,000
four or five days it was very very

950
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,880
exciting and i think it was day two of

951
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,640
the exercise

952
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,039
our red team had managed to compromise

953
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,760
their kits so we owned the kits we

954
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,919
pivoted through their kits and started

955
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,960
to attack this mock city through the

956
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,880
kits themselves we had

957
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,039
iot devices we had all this other stuff

958
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,559
in the city and they were hacking it and

959
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,440
just having a great time so success and

960
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,039
in fact it was a really cool thing

961
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,360
because not only did they show them the

962
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,200
vulnerabilities in the kits

963
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,360
the ttps that the blue teamers were

964
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,519
using actually exposed them

965
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,159
to two issues compromise right so this

966
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,559
not only helped those two army cyber

967
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,159
protection teams

968
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,679
learn but they actually changed the

969
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,200
whole ttps for for the entire cyber

970
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
protection brigade so this is big news

971
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,360
really fun stuff huge success

972
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,799
best day too

973
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,080
josh is laughing because he knows what

974
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,760
happened on day four

975
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,960
so

976
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
they got their act together after day

977
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,840
two and started fighting back they were

978
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,440
cleaning us out of the infrastructure we

979
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
have maps where we could show everything

980
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,279
was pre-owned we had embeds all

981
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,480
throughout the environment this little

982
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,679
city and such

983
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,760
and so the whole thing was red and then

984
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,519
we showed you know at the end of day one

985
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,200
there was little pockets of blue as they

986
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,640
cleaned us out they were pushing us out

987
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
and we're fighting back and forth matt

988
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,880
hussein was also part of that red team

989
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,240
so we're fighting back and forth and

990
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,720
pushing them and i gotta say by day four

991
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
of the exercise there wasn't a whole lot

992
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,720
of red left

993
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,559
so something happened that i didn't

994
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,880
anticipate tony's like loving this look

995
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,440
at him you're ready to pounce so i'm

996
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,039
lonely on defense they neither think so

997
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,159
yeah they need a victory well where do

998
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,159
you hear what they did so um they were

999
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,279
doing so well there was so much less red

1000
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,960
left in the environment

1001
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,560
that they asked their leadership these

1002
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,960
are blue teamers in a cyber protection

1003
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,639
team 100 soldiers

1004
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,918
they said

1005
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,760
we're cleaning them out we think we got

1006
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,399
this can we go on offense and i expected

1007
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,000
them to say no that's not what you

1008
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,760
should be training on not practicing

1009
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,079
this is a validation exercise after all

1010
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,839
but the leadership said

1011
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,359
yeah

1012
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,280
why don't you go on offense now we

1013
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,119
didn't know this as a red team the blue

1014
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,879
team just decided we're cleaning them

1015
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,800
out we've got a hundred soldiers here

1016
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,879
you keep cleaning them these folks here

1017
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,480
you start packing that this is now

1018
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,239
military doctrine they call it defend

1019
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,918
forward defend forward yes

1020
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,000
so they start scanning the environment

1021
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,159
that the red team is coming from and

1022
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,359
there's an important lesson in this and

1023
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,760
it's a big fail um

1024
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,839
this these were not our systems but it

1025
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,119
turns out there were some webcams on the

1026
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,359
walls of the

1027
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,680
room where the red team was operating

1028
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,560
now again these belong to the building

1029
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,800
that we were inhabiting but everything

1030
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,599
was in game they found these webcams

1031
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,480
default username default password they

1032
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,359
got into them and were able to see the

1033
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,680
entire red team campaign

1034
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,160
on a whiteboard and then play that back

1035
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,079
to their leadership so see what we got

1036
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,320
right so so the lesson learned in this

1037
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,200
one

1038
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,240
is iot will always bite you in the ass

1039
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,200
right

1040
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,040
um but also i think more than that too

1041
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,480
it's the stuff

1042
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,560
the the devices in your environment that

1043
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,079
you don't know about

1044
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,400
they're gonna get you that's how you'll

1045
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,880
likely get compromised so

1046
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,440
the the time and effort you spend as a

1047
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,400
defender

1048
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,960
building up that asset inventory and

1049
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,040
maintaining it if you don't know what's

1050
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,119
there it's almost impossible for you to

1051
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,599
defend it that's why for the critical

1052
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,160
controls asset inventory is still number

1053
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,200
one

1054
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,000
nearer right yeah so it's vital number

1055
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
two now yeah you gotta know what you got

1056
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,520
or you can't defend it and we saw that

1057
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,440
so we had great success and then a

1058
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,160
couple days later oops iot

1059
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,040
get you every time

1060
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,200
so i gotta ask has anybody actually been

1061
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,720
on a breach

1062
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,280
that started

1063
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,760
not metaphorically but literally

1064
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,680
from the server running under the dude's

1065
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,839
desk

1066
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,839
a couple

1067
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,440
been there that is amazing so we've got

1068
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,800
this breach this is a 18 million dollar

1069
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,680
breach okay so back then it was a lot 18

1070
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,960
million dollars now we hear that it's

1071
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,480
like what the hell wow you guys did a

1072
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,160
nice job way to go you defended

1073
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,359
yourselves

1074
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,440
18 million dollars back then was not

1075
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,480
such a small deal

1076
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,160
it was one of those things where it's

1077
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,400
like all right we we got breached

1078
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
mandy comes in whatever they start

1079
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,000
digging around they point us kind of

1080
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,400
where okay we're seeing this this seems

1081
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,880
to be we think we found patient zero

1082
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,200
it's you know this this ip over here

1083
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,720
and i piece on our desktop segment

1084
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,000
all right

1085
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,760
we go look

1086
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,839
hunt around hunter only took days to

1087
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,359
find this thing right

1088
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,880
because i mean it's on the desktop

1089
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,440
segment it happens dhcp how did this

1090
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,240
person even end up with a

1091
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,079
it was still a dhcp address it was just

1092
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,680
you know permanent at least

1093
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,079
and we get there we find this thing we

1094
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,480
have to basically backtrack some nat and

1095
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,720
figure out okay where how's how's this

1096
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,240
thing getting traffic

1097
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
all right so someone punched a nice hole

1098
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,839
here

1099
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:46,800
and

1100
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
we finally get to this box and it is

1101
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,359
literally the box running under the desk

1102
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,440
when we look at this application it is a

1103
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,359
i i don't remember exactly what it was

1104
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,119
designed to allow our customers to

1105
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,800
upload files

1106
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,839
great idea

1107
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,160
what types of files does this thing let

1108
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,680
you upload

1109
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,880
well we

1110
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,040
we built it so that you know they they

1111
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
could send us different stuff from their

1112
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,640
website

1113
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,880
what do you mean from their website

1114
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,040
well like we debug stuff for them

1115
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,920
would you write this in isp

1116
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,040
no not that cool.net asp

1117
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,520
all right

1118
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,280
all right so give it give us the box

1119
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,119
we're gonna we're gonna just quickly pen

1120
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,880
test this thing

1121
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,040
three minutes

1122
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,520
three freaking minutes and we've got a

1123
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,960
shell why

1124
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,599
because you can upload anything

1125
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,079
you can directly traversal to anywhere

1126
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,359
you want

1127
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,359
including webroot

1128
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,520
of course it's running with it is

1129
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,640
running with a domain admin account

1130
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,640
so yes upload that really cool shell.asp

1131
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,720
put it in webroot hit it boom

1132
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,400
so

1133
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,440
this

1134
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,800
this is

1135
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,440
20 years ago you know we're letting them

1136
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,880
upload code to our site

1137
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,480
anybody heard of citizen developers

1138
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,800
this is a fun concept keep yours out for

1139
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,880
this one because this is this cool idea

1140
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,960
that we're gonna let our users write

1141
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,560
code

1142
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,320
for our systems

1143
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,160
now that's really not what it's supposed

1144
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,839
to be it's kind of like how devops was

1145
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,359
never really meant to be like you throw

1146
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,280
security out the window and you just you

1147
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
go nuts but that's how everybody thought

1148
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,400
it was going to be initially

1149
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,920
and this goes to the theme of this so

1150
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,880
this whole

1151
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,839
what's old is new again so the

1152
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,119
you've got developers running around

1153
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,240
right now talking about we're going to

1154
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,839
create citizen developers where our

1155
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,880
users who are the citizens are writing

1156
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,119
code and deploying it to production

1157
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,800
how do you think that one's working out

1158
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,040
it's literally one of the battles we're

1159
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,359
fighting right now of why this is a bad

1160
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,599
idea the concept is supposed to be used

1161
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,440
like a no code solution something you've

1162
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,720
secured

1163
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,400
but understand that that's not how

1164
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,240
people are seeing it so those of you my

1165
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,319
friends in the appsec world

1166
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,599
keep your ears up for this one because

1167
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,720
that's the next one you're going to want

1168
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,839
to be paying attention to

1169
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,839
yeah that's great um

1170
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,000
exciting stuff

1171
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,440
you know because

1172
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,560
well

1173
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,079
i i'm just reflecting on

1174
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,200
all of the

1175
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,280
the lessons i've learned and all of the

1176
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,680
security minefields i've been personally

1177
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,560
dragged through and and all of the scars

1178
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,960
that i've i've received and then the

1179
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,319
thought of just

1180
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,680
letting people who haven't experienced

1181
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,640
that

1182
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,440
right production code just

1183
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,480
yeah

1184
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,240
i mean they'll i mean they're going to

1185
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,839
run through the same briar patches and

1186
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,760
same minefields the hard way i just

1187
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,000
would rather avoid that happening on my

1188
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,480
production system somehow

1189
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
at least don't be there for it when it

1190
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,319
happens yeah well that's true

1191
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,240
start polishing your resume

1192
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,520
um

1193
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,960
no but i mean that's the thing i mean

1194
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,400
it's one of the things i started talking

1195
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,599
about here i we're not

1196
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,160
we're not imparting those lessons right

1197
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,319
like i learned a bunch of stuff when i

1198
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,760
got to the labs

1199
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,560
after after college and i learned from a

1200
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,839
lot of people who were a lot smarter

1201
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:28,800
than me

1202
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,000
who'd been dragged through these

1203
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,560
minefields right

1204
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,319
maybe the problem isn't that we're doing

1205
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,240
a bad job educating about people about

1206
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,400
the mindfulness maybe the problem is

1207
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,359
we're letting the minefields persist

1208
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,160
right

1209
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,440
i mean

1210
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,040
you know

1211
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,839
is it is it the fault

1212
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,800
of the education or is it the fault of

1213
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,240
our infrastructure that allows these

1214
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,079
these things to proliferate

1215
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,319
right

1216
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,599
maybe the latter

1217
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,160
because if we're still seeing

1218
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,040
if if the land attack can come back

1219
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,880
in network stacks because and the reason

1220
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,720
that happens is because frankly the

1221
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,319
easiest way to develop a new network

1222
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,880
stack causes that that failure mode to

1223
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,359
happen right then then maybe we need to

1224
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,000
address that in a more fundamental level

1225
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,680
with with frameworks that don't allow

1226
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,520
you to make those mistakes right like

1227
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,800
web development

1228
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,480
right sorry

1229
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,839
um

1230
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,880
so

1231
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,680
i mean talks about

1232
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,400
or stories about improving that yeah

1233
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
situation so i mean you know as you were

1234
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,560
describing that hal i was thinking about

1235
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,119
how much we push our customers to say

1236
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,160
build your web applications using the

1237
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,640
various security primitives in your

1238
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,960
framework because they take care of a

1239
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,880
lot of stuff like cross-site scripting

1240
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,160
they'll do authentication they'll do

1241
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,800
session management but even when we push

1242
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,160
them to do that

1243
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,079
some developer didn't get the message

1244
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,319
and builds his or her own thing on the

1245
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,880
side of that um it's a frustrating thing

1246
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,400
it happens all the time

1247
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,440
but

1248
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,119
this gets to what tony was saying if you

1249
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,520
get most of your developers developing

1250
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,720
in that framework using those

1251
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,599
appropriate apis properly

1252
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,240
you might drain 90 percent of that swamp

1253
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,760
which gives us less findings as pen

1254
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,079
testers and that's a good thing

1255
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,760
but the stuff you find still is those

1256
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,800
same fundamental set of vulnerabilities

1257
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,440
but so web apps just come immediately to

1258
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,079
mind as a type of framework that really

1259
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,800
helps deal uh solving these problems

1260
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,720
sort of systematically

1261
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,599
i'm sure there's others

1262
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,800
i think

1263
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,240
you know that is symptomatic of what i

1264
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,400
would call the the wizardry model of

1265
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,560
security right and and same that's the

1266
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,640
i.t model right this is about

1267
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,760
wizardry you know this clever artistic

1268
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,200
free form you know there's sort of an

1269
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,640
implication here right that and

1270
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,880
structure is bad the open source

1271
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,319
developers won't put up with using

1272
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,040
security frameworks or whatever you know

1273
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,119
we don't cross bridges that haven't been

1274
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,280
built by professional engineers

1275
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,440
using tables of material strength rules

1276
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,280
that you know we'd we wouldn't get on a

1277
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,440
commercial plane where the pilot wasn't

1278
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,359
certified re-tested the plane wasn't

1279
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,440
built to spec the bolts were tested that

1280
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,359
does not provide us perfect safety by

1281
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,160
the way

1282
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,800
it provides us a rational way to make a

1283
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,119
reasonable security decision that was

1284
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,560
safe for me to get a commercial aircraft

1285
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,000
to come out here that doesn't mean a

1286
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,520
pilot pilot doesn't show up drunk or

1287
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,359
somebody got lazy and didn't follow the

1288
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,119
spec but you know we have courts and

1289
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,119
things to deal with that for for good or

1290
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,000
bad

1291
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,920
but this idea that you know this is all

1292
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,720
artwork and magic and

1293
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,960
you cannot build a society right

1294
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,040
wizardry is more about job security for

1295
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,359
all cats like me it's terrible public

1296
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,240
policy you can't base a government or an

1297
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,560
economy on wizardry because it doesn't

1298
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,880
scale it's not repeatable doesn't have

1299
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,240
some of those properties that doc talked

1300
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
about so i think there's some of that we

1301
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,280
see resistance to this idea now

1302
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,119
the the notions

1303
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,119
we have to think i think about you know

1304
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,720
we won't get the kind of rules of

1305
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,720
physics right that concrete is this

1306
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,640
strong under these conditions with you

1307
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,160
know blah blah blah the strength of

1308
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,240
steel we'd love to have that kind of

1309
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,119
data

1310
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,880
in cyber but i don't think it's coming

1311
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,560
but i like zero days for concrete

1312
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,520
exactly

1313
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,480
but you know but things do happen but we

1314
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,400
have a pretty good understanding right

1315
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,560
and modeling and all kinds of things uh

1316
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,040
so in security frameworks we know how to

1317
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,480
design

1318
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,319
memory safe tools we know how to design

1319
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,760
certain kind of structures that don't

1320
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
allow risky behavior

1321
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,240
you know and that in general will sort

1322
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,200
of guide people towards making a

1323
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,520
good decision almost all the time and

1324
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,760
prevent really bad decisions

1325
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,440
and what when wizardry what we do is we

1326
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,359
tend to blame the user oh it was the

1327
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,119
artist right and if i ever see and

1328
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,720
please if i hope i don't heard anybody's

1329
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,480
feelings here

1330
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,200
don't say stupid user tricks ever again

1331
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,520
don't ever blame the users again okay

1332
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,200
they have jobs to do

1333
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,000
and

1334
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,920
they are not trained wizards in this

1335
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,760
business and to blame them and i still

1336
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,920
see people there's a recent book right

1337
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,599
how do i stop stupid user tricks or

1338
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,880
whatever that book that's been out

1339
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,680
recently i've seen government executives

1340
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,920
we have to you know punish people for

1341
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,480
stupid user tricks are stupid

1342
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,839
good luck with that right we're not

1343
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,280
going to train

1344
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,200
our way to greatness in this business we

1345
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,480
need to design

1346
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,920
we want we have to educate people better

1347
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,920
we have to make more wear absolutely but

1348
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,520
we also in parallel have to design

1349
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
technology that makes it harder for them

1350
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,359
to make bad choices easier for them to

1351
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,680
make good and we do that in every other

1352
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,640
aspect of our risky uh social lives end

1353
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,040
of editorial thank you sir

1354
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,400
no it's not because i'm going to keep it

1355
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,599
going

1356
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,680
i'm not letting you off that easily no

1357
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,280
but yeah

1358
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,880
when you think about this

1359
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,079
it's the same thing it's like we were

1360
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,599
talking about with the executives before

1361
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,119
right like

1362
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,400
why

1363
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,319
are they doing the things they're doing

1364
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,640
just add one riff yeah here's what i've

1365
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,560
said also when

1366
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,040
when we as an industry blame the users

1367
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,800
here's what i've been training users to

1368
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,920
do to ask us people like us

1369
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,680
when we pick on them they should turn to

1370
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,560
folks like and say hey mr wizard after

1371
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,040
umpteen decades and countless amounts of

1372
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,359
money how come i still don't know if

1373
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,599
that email actually came from you or not

1374
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,520
or when i go to a website i actually

1375
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
don't know if it's that webs what is

1376
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,800
wrong with you people that you can't

1377
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,920
even give me basic safety that's what i

1378
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,240
have training people to ask us because

1379
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,160
frankly they should expect that sorry

1380
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:28,700
done

1381
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,000
[Laughter]

1382
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,800
tony's on a roll i love it

1383
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,440
monster higher

1384
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,800
make up for all my mistakes for the last

1385
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,240
45. dude you're 66 you're not 86. okay

1386
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
come on i've got grandkids though

1387
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:50,960
they're

1388
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,800
attempting a distraction

1389
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,640
but no so

1390
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,800
that whole stupid user tricks or

1391
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,400
management doesn't understand or

1392
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,240
anything else i'll challenge you right

1393
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,400
now everybody in this room you call

1394
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,319
yourself security professionals in some

1395
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,960
sense of the word

1396
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,880
when you hear that when you're feeling

1397
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,800
that

1398
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
turn that around on yourself for a

1399
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,240
minute

1400
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,960
what didn't i tell them

1401
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,040
that i should have

1402
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,680
how did the message i tried to give them

1403
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,760
fail to land such that they're doing

1404
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,680
these things again

1405
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,760
what am i doing wrong that makes them

1406
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,400
feel like they need to have

1407
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,559
citizen developers writing code and

1408
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,720
dropping it in production

1409
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,640
you know what are the things ask

1410
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,960
yourself because as tony said everybody

1411
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,640
everybody's trying to do their job i

1412
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,160
mean when we look at like phishing and

1413
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,599
when why people click on these things

1414
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,880
it's because they're busy they're doing

1415
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,160
a lot of stuff

1416
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,720
their job isn't to sit there and you

1417
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,040
know analyze emails to determine are

1418
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,480
they safe or not

1419
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,960
especially when our you know hr or

1420
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,880
somebody decides to send an email out

1421
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,599
that looks just like the phishing

1422
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,400
email we sent last week to do a test

1423
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,400
and you know so

1424
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
even there okay

1425
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,760
have we given hr the expectations in the

1426
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,480
situation like that of here's how you

1427
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,559
properly send an email where you have to

1428
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,000
send a link that someone's going to go

1429
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,240
to surveymonkey or whatever to fill out

1430
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
some employee

1431
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,400
satisfaction deal or something

1432
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,280
so

1433
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,680
think about those things because you

1434
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,440
know as doc was saying our job

1435
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,680
is to arm these people with

1436
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,160
the ability to be safe to arm these

1437
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,520
people with the ability to make the

1438
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,319
decisions we want them to make

1439
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,400
threats flood all that stuff

1440
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,240
neuroscience will tell you that doesn't

1441
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,920
motivate people to do the things you

1442
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,280
want them to do that motivates them to

1443
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,559
run away

1444
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,599
so let's maybe not make them run away

1445
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,599
let's kind of like you know

1446
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,680
we want them in the room with us talking

1447
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,720
to us

1448
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,559
but that requires us to be smarter about

1449
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,839
how we talk to them

1450
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,640
and you really want to develop empathy

1451
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,000
for for people

1452
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,240
who are not you know sort of security

1453
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,680
mavens as we all are in this room

1454
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,200
spend some time with me because i do ir

1455
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,119
for organizations

1456
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,680
who by definition are below the security

1457
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,760
poverty line right i mean if if they

1458
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,359
were above the security poverty line

1459
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,720
they wouldn't be calling an outside

1460
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,200
incident response firm to come help them

1461
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,200
and and these are

1462
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,280
these are good people right these are

1463
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,319
good people who run companies that make

1464
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,599
fishing poles or farm equipment or

1465
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,359
whatever it is right and

1466
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:40,480
and

1467
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,440
just keeping the lights on you know is

1468
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,240
is

1469
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,200
their focus and and employing these

1470
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,599
workers and keeping the assembly lines

1471
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,000
running and things like that and

1472
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,640
computer systems

1473
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,520
are the least of their of their worries

1474
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,440
and therefore the security of those

1475
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,319
computer systems is a vanishingly small

1476
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,319
dot on their radar

1477
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,359
um

1478
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,040
and

1479
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,400
i think it is incumbent upon us

1480
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,000
to be

1481
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,400
the rising tide that lifts all boats

1482
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,319
because because those people my

1483
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,880
customers who i deal with day in and day

1484
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,680
out

1485
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,000
are never

1486
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,760
going to be touched

1487
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,200
by

1488
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,160
people like you in this room i mean they

1489
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,880
they

1490
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,599
they need help but they need help in the

1491
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,200
form of

1492
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,920
out of the box it just works and is

1493
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,359
secure

1494
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,640
um

1495
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,280
because there's there's not enough of

1496
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,400
you

1497
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,640
out there

1498
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,359
technology

1499
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,680
oh you want hope okay

1500
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,720
is that the next panel uh

1501
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:22,770
[Laughter]

1502
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,040
hope hope

1503
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,400
hope

1504
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,480
hope

1505
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,440
hope i mean

1506
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,200
i i will say

1507
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,000
that what i was saying before

1508
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
i am seeing those behaviors start to

1509
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
change with security people honestly i

1510
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,359
am seeing

1511
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,079
we we if you talk to

1512
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,079
companies you know consulting companies

1513
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,200
whatever that specializes in fishing

1514
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,119
exercises for instance more and more

1515
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,200
they're getting away from that mode of

1516
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,960
three strikes and you're fired and that

1517
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,319
kind of crap

1518
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,280
so i i think it's we're starting to turn

1519
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,720
a corner on some of that it's a long way

1520
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,640
to go okay i mean we're turning

1521
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,960
something much larger than you know

1522
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,960
evergreen or whatever you know i mean

1523
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,760
this is a big boat to move but

1524
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,119
um

1525
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,559
you know i i think that's the one thing

1526
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,440
that actually gives me hope is

1527
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,000
um twitter our our favorite place in

1528
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,200
cyber right

1529
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,079
um well it was until somebody bought it

1530
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,440
um

1531
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,119
but

1532
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,960
no i i i

1533
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,599
i've seen countless polls out there what

1534
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,440
what is the one skill you feel we need

1535
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,839
more of in cyber and every time i see

1536
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,079
that poll come up someone asked that

1537
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,160
question what what do we need an infosec

1538
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,599
what's the one thing

1539
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,920
more often than not empathy

1540
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,000
is the answer i see which means we're at

1541
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,040
least aware of the problem

1542
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,240
well that's step number one of the

1543
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,040
12-step program

1544
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,160
it's hope i'm just i'm looking for

1545
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,680
something

1546
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,920
yeah we're throwing out a little bit now

1547
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,920
well so some of us and some of you might

1548
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,920
be old enough to remember when uh we

1549
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,599
used to have to like really beg people

1550
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,280
to care about security

1551
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,280
okay well our wish came true everybody

1552
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,520
does now they may not understand it

1553
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,200
right they may be panicked by it they

1554
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,559
may overreact

1555
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,640
but the the level awareness has never

1556
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,319
been higher and i will say

1557
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,720
over the last several years so uh our

1558
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,880
non-profit is the also the home of the

1559
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,640
multi-state isaac if you know what that

1560
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,720
means right so we're like the the

1561
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,880
central reporting station for uh i think

1562
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,319
now 13 14 000 state local governments

1563
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,400
and so we provide the watch and the

1564
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,079
instant response and advisories that

1565
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,839
kind of stuff and there's a growing

1566
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,200
awareness though across the entire

1567
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,119
industry small businesses and so forth

1568
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,520
and and this is a guiding principle for

1569
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,880
us at cis

1570
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,760
most of our economy cannot and will not

1571
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,280
be able to defend itself in the current

1572
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,319
model

1573
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,240
there's no cyber professional to educate

1574
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,319
at most of their you know literally by

1575
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,359
the count of the small business

1576
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,359
administration right most businesses

1577
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,520
will never have one of you on staff

1578
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,280
they'll never buy a pricey security tool

1579
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,319
directly

1580
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,599
they'll never

1581
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,400
you know that's just not going to happen

1582
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,000
they need to be protected differently

1583
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,680
and people are starting to see that now

1584
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,359
that you know you have to work upstream

1585
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,400
you have to work to the service

1586
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,920
providers you have to work through the

1587
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,520
cloud providers

1588
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,200
and you have to start thinking of we're

1589
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,960
going to educate people

1590
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,359
and we're going to make this an economic

1591
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,440
and risk decision as opposed to a

1592
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,839
technology decision that's what's really

1593
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,280
i think going to change the day if

1594
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,119
anything will change it so we work with

1595
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,559
state local governments that are now

1596
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,119
moving away from we're going to mandate

1597
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,440
that every uh company doing business in

1598
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,760
the state use the nist csf

1599
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,200
you know what whatever that means with

1600
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,359
all respect my friends at nist

1601
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,119
and we're going to incentivize the

1602
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,799
voluntary adoption

1603
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,520
of practices as found in things like the

1604
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,240
csf the crs controls etc and this is a

1605
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,760
thing it's starting to take off because

1606
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,160
it it gets to the decision-making and

1607
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,720
less about the technology you need a

1608
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,400
structure to point people to right to

1609
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,319
say these are the things so i think the

1610
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,400
shift in public policy

1611
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,880
puts the risk kind of where it belongs

1612
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,680
right because for a business executive a

1613
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,760
dollar spent on cyber whatever that

1614
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,680
means competes for a dollar

1615
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,000
spent on the risk of their reputation or

1616
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,760
the safety of their employees or the you

1617
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,440
know all these other risks that they

1618
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,920
deal with and if we try to compete it is

1619
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,359
wizard risk

1620
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,200
there's never an end right the answer is

1621
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,440
always more spend more and that's not an

1622
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,040
acceptable business answer so we don't

1623
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,799
want to bankrupt our economy to get

1624
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,400
better security because that's that's

1625
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,960
clearly not going to cut it either

1626
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,520
well said well said so you want hope

1627
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,720
i'm sitting here thinking where can i

1628
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,880
find hope i tried to delay a little yeah

1629
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,680
yeah i got it i got it for you i do

1630
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,640
so

1631
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,599
one of the truly wonderful things i get

1632
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,480
to do is to talk to students

1633
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,559
high school kids

1634
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,720
community college students

1635
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,319
four-year degree students master's

1636
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,200
students

1637
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,520
i talk to them a lot and

1638
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,000
you know i go to the local college and

1639
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,400
talk with them local high school cyber

1640
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,480
patriot teams stuff like that

1641
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,400
it is wonderful

1642
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,440
these kids are so smart so bright so

1643
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,520
eager so energetic

1644
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,880
it gives me hope um i mean no offense to

1645
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,640
all of my friends here i think they're

1646
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,079
going to be better at cyber security

1647
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,559
than we are i mean they are re and we've

1648
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,880
built some frameworks they they stand on

1649
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,480
tony's shoulders right but um

1650
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,880
if you do feel despair if you do feel

1651
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,440
like man this is all fail all the time

1652
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,520
talk to young people doing this kind of

1653
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,760
stuff and you'll say you know there is a

1654
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,720
future here that could be very bright so

1655
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,480
that's where i find my hope and it's

1656
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,079
it's been wonderful

1657
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,520

uh so i'm part of a major uh non-profit

1669
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,880
now whose business model is entirely

1670
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,200
dependent upon volunteerism

1671
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,799
here's one of the first volunteers

1672
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,400
here's one of the other first volunteers

1673

that contribute right this is high

1674
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,000
priced talent that we couldn't afford to

1675
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,880
hire

1676
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,680
that freely gives up their time to help

1677
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,680
create things like cis benchmarks

1678
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,160
controls and so forth there's an army of

1679
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,839
you out there right

1680
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,480
people of high talent goodwill in fact i

1681
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,040
just announced uh several weeks ago the

1682
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,799
formation of a new not not not a

1683
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,160
separate legal nonprofit but a

1684
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,079
non-profit confederacy called nonprofit

1685
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,559
cyber which includes first

1686
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,520
global cyber uh cyber

1687
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,920
cloud security alliance owasp you know

1688
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,640
name i think we're up to three dozen now

1689
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,480
all of us are dependent upon sort of

1690
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,640
goodwill volunteerism sharing of

1691
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,200
information and so forth and i cannot

1692
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,400
tell you how

1693
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,480
great that feels to be a part of that

1694
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,839
kind of community right that is

1695
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,319
represented by that kind of volunteerism

1696
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,079
so there's this feeling of

1697
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,240
we have a problem that we need to work

1698
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,880
together and i'm willing to quit talking

1699
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,960
and start doing so the nonprofits that

1700
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,040
we go after to to join our confederacy

1701
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,960
are what we call the doers or content

1702
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,520
creators or service providers right

1703
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,480
that's a really important thing that uh

1704
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,079
that i never take for granted because

1705
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,920
again i grew up in a world where it's

1706
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,559
your taxpayer dollars that made to break

1707
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,559
any program but to see

1708
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,799
the kind of talent that will come to the

1709
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,799
table often sponsored by company i mean

1710
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,400
there is no open source model without

1711
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,559
this this kind of spirit right so this

1712
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,400
is what i think gives me hope on any

1713
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,160
given day and also gives me a sense of

1714
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,799
responsibility to uh do my best to

1715
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:41,920
organize

1716
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,000
and one of our volunteers is back there

1717
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,440
asking that question by the way it was

1718
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,000
not a loaded question but thank you

1719
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,200
so i think you should wrap this up

1720
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,960
because we're kind of getting yeah yeah

1721
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,200
you're giving us the

1722
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,559

1723
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:54,900
um

1724
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,640
[Music]

1725
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,799
i don't take all my volunteers because i

1726
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,559
need

1727
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:01,760
believe they're not

1728
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,280
it turns out they're not supposed to

1729
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,400
know they're not like great people

1730

and i hope that um you all have some

1736
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,400
takeaways from the stories that we were

1737
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,280
telling but one of the purposes of a

1738
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,520
gathering like this is for

1739
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,839
us all to get together and learn from

1740
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,760
each other and and tell each other

1741
