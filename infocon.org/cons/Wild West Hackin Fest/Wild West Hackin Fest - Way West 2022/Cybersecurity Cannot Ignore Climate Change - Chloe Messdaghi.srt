I'm so excited all right let's do this

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,820
um so welcome to cyber security cannot

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
ignore climate change and I am so

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,340
thankful for Wild West hacking Fest for

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,500
accepting this talk I cannot tell you

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,320
how hard it has been to try to get this

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,439
talk accepted at conferences in cyber

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,359
security and we'll dive into that about

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,279
why that happened probably all right

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,320

but I really I'm looking forward to

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,240
going into the real contents of this

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,439
entire talk

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,899
so before I begin I know that this week

49
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,020
has been insane for many of us it is a

50
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,840
lot to process what is going on in the

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,180
US and I know the last thing we want to

52
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,220
hear is more horrible things especially

53
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,840
when you have the war going on in

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,360
Ukraine and Russia but please bear with

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,300
me because if you need to take a deep

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,540
breath please do so this is going to be

57
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,940
a talk which is going to have a lot of

58
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,920
information at the beginning and then

59
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,739
it'll be more about talking about how do

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,840
we resolve these situations

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,400
but first I want to make sure we're all

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,500
on the same page about what is the

63
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,020
status of our planet Earth so let's

64
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,060
first go into the real stuff so as you

65
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,680
may know that sea levels are rising

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,840
oceans are becoming warmer and there's

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,580
these longer more intense droughts

68
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,860
happening across the world and

69
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,379
especially in the US as well that means

70
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,480
wildlife and fresh water supplies are

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,720
also becoming thin from polar bears in

72
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,940
the Arctic to the Marine Turtles and the

73
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,340
coast of Africa are planets diversity of

74
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,340
life is at a risk of changing climate

75
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,800
and I just want to First share this

76
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,260
slide with you about one-third of all

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,420
planet animal species could be extinct

78
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,280
in the next 50 years that's right

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,260
we're looking at you know elephants

80
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,720
those Turtles those polar bears and all

81
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,120
the animals still already on going close

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,940
to extinction list if they said about 99

83
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,959
of them will be extinct within the next

84
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,120
uh cup like I think they said 10 to 20

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,819
years so we're looking at a huge problem

86
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,440
here because if we're thinking about

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,720
planet and animal species about third of

88
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,280
them will go extinct in the next 50

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,340
years what about humans

90
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,500
because this is going to impact us as

91
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,640
well

92
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,800
and so I want to talk a little bit first

93
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,980
about what is the case for humans

94
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,260
so you may have heard this term climate

95
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,420
refugees but in Australian Think Tank

96
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,299
IEP predicts that at least 1.2 billion

97
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,159
people could be displaced by such

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,700
climate-related events by 2050.

99
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,239
and a majority of 30.7 million people

100
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,720
were displaced in 2020 alone when they

101
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
were fleeting floods Wildlife drought or

102
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
heat waves according to report released

103
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,019
by The International Federation of Red

104
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,720
Cross red crescent societies

105
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,180
this image that you see right here was

106
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,939
taken in 2017 when a third of Bangladesh

107
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,660
was underwater as blood Devastation and

108
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,760
this forced people to Forever leave

109
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,699
their areas they became what we know as

110
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,280
climate refugees

111
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280
and in Bangladesh and alone is predicted

112
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,860
that 17 of the country will be submerged

113
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,520
by the rise in sea level by 2050 and 20

114
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,380
million people living there will lose

115
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,540
their homes

116
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,780
and that's not just there it's also

117
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,139
happening in the U.S as well

118
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,320
we're also seeing this take place across

119
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,440
the world and especially also in Central

120
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,180
America

121
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,040
you know today many people in developing

122
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,020
countries are really suffering a lot

123
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,600
from droughts and windstorms on scale we

124
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,360
have never ever seen before and I just

125
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,220
want to state that at this time our

126
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,500
planet is at a 1.2

127
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,979
Celsius degree warmer Planet okay 1.2

128
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,180
degrees it's really important to

129
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,220
remember this because you'll understand

130
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,340
later on how bad this is so 1.2 right

131
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,860
now at this very moment okay and what

132
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,960
we're seeing is you know

133
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,820
we're seeing things that we've never

134
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,560
seen before when it comes to weather

135
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,800
patterns of human existence

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,020
so this also means that depriving of

137
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,720
daily food and basic needs and as we

138
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,280
know from you know Central America

139
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,500
countries such as Honduras Guatemala and

140
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,479
El Salvador were hit by two incredibly

141
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,419
massive hurricanes which poured across

142
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,340
the border so you have to think about

143
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,320
all these people have left because they

144
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,020
had no food they had no shelter and they

145
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,880
came up through Central America into

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,000
Crossing Borders into Mexico hoping

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,060
to get Refugee status in the U.S border

148
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,220
the term climate refugees was first

149
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,900
coined to describe the increasing

150
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,360
large-scale migration and cross-border

151
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,979
mass movements of people that were

152
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,960
partly caused by such weather-related

153
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,300
disasters

154
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,500
and as you know I am based in California

155
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,479
and you're in California right now as

156
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,699
well if you're there physically but the

157
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,919
reality is that we have fires we've had

158
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,960
so much fires I think like the one thing

159
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,259
that was uh during the pandemic was in

160
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,039
2020 when I like opened the shades okay

161
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,780
I have this thing with Groundhog Day I

162
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,300
hate that movie for one reason it's like

163
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,759
nothing changes it's the same thing

164
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,220
every day it's like my worst fear in a

165
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,139
waking moment and so everybody when I

166
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,639
push open the currents and being stuck

167
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,199
inside because of the pandemic it's

168
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,120
always a sunny Sky I know I shouldn't be

169
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,740
complaining because I know people have

170
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,259
rough weather but imagine seeing that

171
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,199
every single day opening your thing the

172
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,360
only exciting part was when I opened it

173
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,919
and then suddenly it looked like we were

174
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,979
on Mars because the whole sky was so

175
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,039
orange it was the most scary thing I

176
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,220
have ever experienced opening like the

177
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,580
window like Shades just seeing that it

178
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,479
was a media get recognition that this is

179
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,840
not okay second is I am scared if this

180
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,120
is something that people will see often

181
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,800
remember when we saw what was happening

182
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,300
in Greece

183
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,759
I mean just think about that we are

184
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,460
entering in a situation we have no idea

185
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,039
how we're going to get out of it

186
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,860
and the drought conditions have gone so

187
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,740
much worse as you can see on this graph

188
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,220
right here

189
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,160
so if you are Upstate like in New York

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,539
congratulations you're probably safe

191
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,139
from this drought you have a wonderful

192
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,000
rainfall and I'm so jealous because I

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,620
absolutely love the rain I would be

194
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,419
happy every single day if I saw a rain

195
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,400
injury weather

196
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,880
but the reality is that right now the

197
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,740
reason why we're having these fires

198
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,080
increased and harder to put out is

199
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,940
because you're dealing with

200
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,080
round that is so dehydrated so dry that

201
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,479
it becomes kind of like this instant

202
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,060
fire where you cannot put it out so if

203
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,400
the ground was somewhat damp right if we

204
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,120
had rain you know once every two weeks

205
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,099
right the ground would be easier to

206
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,740
fight a fire but the thing is we haven't

207
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,780
had rain for months

208
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,940
it's harder to put out fire it just

209
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,639
everything goes up so fast and it's

210
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,159
travels so fast and this is why we're

211
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
seeing these extreme fires across

212
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,820
California and other places around the

213
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,839
world

214
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,880
but you know what it's not just fires we

215
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,279
have to worry about because you know

216
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,020
um we are assuming more category three

217
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,740
or higher storms across as well and as

218
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,839
you know the reason why we're getting

219
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,100
these type of storms is because of this

220
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,660
melted glaciers you may not know this

221
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,700
but melted glaciers add to rice and sea

222
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,100
levels which in turn increases colossal

223
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,100
erosion and elevates Storm surges as

224
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,899
warming air and ocean temperatures

225
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,240
create more frequent and intense Coastal

226
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,120
storms like hurricanes and typhoons

227
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,600
and according to NASA and Grace the fact

228
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,120
is is that Greenland and Antarctic Ice

229
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,519
she's are losing significant amount of

230
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,500
land-based ice as a result of

231
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,899
human-caused global warming as you see

232
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,680
in this chart from 2004 to 2020 this is

233
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,019
scary we have never seen it lose this

234
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,120
fast we weren't anticipating this fast

235
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,519
scientists were not anticipating how

236
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,480
fast this is right now and as you know

237
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,779
we have to talk about water right so at

238
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,180
least 14 million tons of plastic ends up

239
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,399
in our ocean every year

240
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,160
and plastic makes up about 80 percent of

241
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,959
our marine debris found from surface

242
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,420
waters to deep sea sediments marine

243
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,040
species ingests were entangled by

244
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,839
plastic debris which caused severe

245
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,880
injuries and death and if you think

246
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,640
that's scary guess what humans are cells

247
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,580
we are consuming a credit card worth of

248
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,760
plastic every single week and that can

249
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
be found in our water our food and so on

250
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
plastic is everywhere but also it is one

251
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
of the things of why we have the Great

252
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,620
Pacific Garbage Patch you may have heard

253
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,839
of this but you see in this image right

254
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,180
here okay

255
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,519
this is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch

256
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,100
all right it is part of a five offshore

257
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,500
plastic accumulation zones in the

258
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,180
world's oceans and is located halfway

259
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,180
between Hawaii and California it covers

260
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,580
approximately the surface area of 1.6

261
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,200
million million square kilometers

262
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,180
and an area that's twice the size of

263
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,820
Texas three times the size of France it

264
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,060
is estimated that between

265
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,700
1.15 million to 2.41 million tons of

266
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,560
plastic are entering our oceans every

267
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,339
year from Rivers so remember that Rivers

268
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,920
okay another key point to remember

269
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,380
but if you don't know about this is that

270
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,160
plastic takes about 400 at least to

271
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,459
decompose but more likely a thousand

272
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,660
years to decompose that means a thousand

273
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,399
years you're wondering about why you're

274
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,860
eating a size of a credit card of

275
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,220
plastic that's why you can't get rid of

276
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,500
it it's hard to get rid of

277
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,220
and the reality of it is that right now

278
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,320
I hate to tell you this but this is the

279
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,339
reality

280
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,740
if you have a plastic water bottle right

281
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,480
now and you're like oh I'll just put in

282
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,240
the recycle because it's recyclable

283
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,920
guess what it's recyclable for maybe

284
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,100
like one more time and that's it but the

285
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,620
thing to know about recycling plastic is

286
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,660
that the US doesn't have a recyclable

287
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,779
program that's right every time that

288
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,180
you're recycling plastic it's guess

289
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,760
where it's going your landfills

290
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,459
and this is a huge problem the reality

291
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,920
was in the past the US used to export

292
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,500
their plastic you know whatever you put

293
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,600
in the recyclable bins or in the trash

294
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,540
they would take that plastic and ship it

295
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,459
to China and China would deal with the

296
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,079
plastic containers

297
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,839
China came out with a ban on plastic

298
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,640
Goods that are being imported into their

299
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,720
country

300
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,600
so now the US is like oh no we don't

301
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,880
have a recyclable program for Plastics

302
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,920
because we don't

303
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,899
if anything you can literally put your

304
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,820
Plastics in the trash can because it

305
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,320
does not matter

306
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,360
at the end it's going to end up the very

307
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,459
same place

308
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,660
so

309
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,839
I know this is very scary to hear

310
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,000
but that's not all okay so we're gonna

311
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,220
keep going here

312
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,899
um you may need a shot after this

313
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,660
conversation that we're having but the

314
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,820
other thing to keep in mind is that um

315
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,579
so in the 70s they shared about climate

316
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,019
change and how this is going to become

317
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,839
an issue and in the reports themselves

318
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,600
they talked about pandemics

319
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,660
and if you're wondering oh no what are

320
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,000
you about to share with me I hate to

321
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,459
tell you this but

322
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,740
pandemics are also caused from climate

323
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,540
change as well there's actually strong

324
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,579
evidence and has been proven since the

325
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,980
70s and the reason for that is

326
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,600
deforestation

327
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,300
so many other causes of climate change

328
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,959
also increases the risk of pandemics

329
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,279
deforestation which occurs mostly in

330
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,620
agriculture purposes is the largest

331
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,279
cause of habitat loss worldwide the loss

332
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,860
of habitat forces animals to migrate and

333
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,600
potentially contact other animals or

334
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
people and then they share germs large

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,339
livestock Farms can also serve as sorts

336
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,440
for spillover of infections for animals

337
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,380
to people so the main ones for that is

338
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,399
like cattle Farms but also palm oil

339
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,620
but the thing is to note is that you

340
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,959
know preventing deforestation that would

341
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,060
help that reduce that root cause of

342
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,500
climate change

343
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,320
it also can help stem biodiversity loss

344
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,019
as well as the slow of animal migrations

345
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,820
that can increase the risk of infection

346
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,880
disease spread in other words

347
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,740
we may need to have more conversations

348
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,899
of having less demand for animal meat

349
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,660
and we may have to do that in more

350
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,779
sustainable animal you know farming is

351
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,220
the other thing that we should also look

352
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,920
into because the emerging of infectious

353
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,959
disease risk and lower green has gas

354
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,180
emissions now the thing to note about

355
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,760
Greenhouse emissions if you have never

356
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,680
heard this term or you have it is

357
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,100
composed of four different gases okay so

358
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,920
you have carbon dioxide methane nitrous

359
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,660
oxide and fluorinated gases

360
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,360
and one of the evidence of this is the

361
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,480
recent Ebola epidemic in the West Africa

362
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,339
um and the reason that this occurred was

363
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,720
from bats

364
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,000
um and because what happens is that the

365
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,620
bats have been forced to leave their

366
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,260
habitats because of the forest that they

367
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,000
were living in have been cut down to

368
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,660
plant palm oil trees this causes Ebola

369
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,980
epidemic to occur

370
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,540
now overall the future risks are not

371
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,420
easy to foretell but climate change hits

372
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,000
hard on several fronts of the matter to

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,240
what and where pathogens appear

374
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,500
including temperature and rainfall

375
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,480
patterns to help limit the risk of

376
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,639
infectious diseases we should do all we

377
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,440
can to vastly reduce the greenhouse gas

378
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,120
emissions and limit global warming to

379
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,579
1.5 degrees at this time once again

380
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:30,199
we're at 1.2 degrees

381
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,839
so as you have now learned and I know

382
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,060
this is depressing it is definitely

383
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,399
depressing but humans and wild animals

384
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,620
are facing really challenges of

385
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,720
surviving because of climate change we

386
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,459
have more frequent of intense drought

387
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,500
storms heat waves rising sea levels

388
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,720
melting glaciers and warming oceans can

389
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,600
directly harm our entire planet where we

390
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,699
live and how we live

391
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,760
and in the U.S climate change it is a

392
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,620
huge problem as well and we have seen

393
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,180
dangerous weather events have been

394
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,760
occurring but that's it could get a lot

395
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,760
worse that's why right now it's

396
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,740
important that we have this conversation

397
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,800
so the reason I bring this up is that

398
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,420
climate change is real

399
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,240
and over the past couple years I've met

400
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,279
with different Executives and boards at

401
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,079
companies in cyber security

402
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,120
and we still have people that deny the

403
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,180
science that climate change is they

404
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,279
don't think that it exists

405
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,100
um and this is a huge problem because

406
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,800
it is real it is happening

407
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,660
and I wanted us to be on the same page

408
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,180
because I find that we need to talk

409
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,860
about it

410
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,320
because at this time I really love this

411
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,779
quote but at this point we are heading

412
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,139
towards a three degree celsius weather

413
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,899
and not weather but planet and globally

414
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,699
we're assuming we're at least going to

415
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,399
hit two degrees at this point because

416
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,740
remember we're at 1.2

417
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,240
and you may have heard of the Paris

418
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,220
agreement and the Paris agreement talks

419
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,319
about why they want to keep all

420
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,740
countries hitting that 1.5 increase not

421
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,380
two degree increase but unfortunately

422
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,179
because of how things are we haven't

423
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,939
done too much around the world we're

424
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,640
looking at a three degree celsius at

425
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,079
this time if we don't do anything

426
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,919
and if you're wondering well what's the

427
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,500
difference between a 1.5 and a two well

428
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,540
the thing is once again we're not in 1.5

429
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,200
right now we are at 1.2 but these are

430
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,940
some of the differences that you would

431
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,760
see if you have a 1.5 versus a 2 degree

432
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,320
celsius but once again I want to

433
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,539
reiterate that recent evidence has shown

434
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,419
that we are going to surpass the two

435
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,760
degrees Celsius we're getting closer to

436
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,640
3 degrees Celsius as our projections if

437
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,940
we don't take steps right now

438
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,100
and here's another one so you can see

439
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,620
the differences as well of what would be

440
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,780
the difference of 1.5 to 2 degrees

441
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,419
Celsius at this time

442
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,100
now one of the things once again I want

443
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,780
to point out is I don't have Graphics of

444
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,919
what it would look like it's three

445
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,320
degrees Celsius just imagine it would be

446
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,860
incredibly horrible for even having a

447
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,240
future here

448
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,179
so um in this you could see the fusion

449
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,940
txx so txx measures like our heat

450
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,440
extremes

451
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,980
the wsdis they themselves are looking at

452
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,020
the measures of hot spells so like

453
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,940
droughts in other words

454
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,580
but the overall the collective Global

455
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,740
goals that we have under that Paris

456
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,080
climate agreement is to prevent Rising

457
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,820
global temperatures from increasing no

458
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,919
more than two degrees it has shifted

459
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,100
from 1.5 to now 2 degrees Celsius

460
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,780
which if you don't know what that is

461
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,480
it's 3.6 Fahrenheit

462
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,000
um with no more so once again they they

463
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
really want to get to 1.5 that was the

464
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,179
original goal but the ideal it's gonna

465
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,820
it seems highly unlikely at this time

466
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,160
unless countries were to take Serious

467
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,740
risks and changes immediately on

468
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,900
businesses at this time

469
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,840
but right now like I said we're on the

470
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,780
track if we don't change anything we're

471
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,880
looking at three degrees so even this

472
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,580
two degrees Celsius 1.5 versus whatever

473
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,380
doesn't really matter because we're

474
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,820
looking at three degrees if we don't

475
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,260
change anything

476
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,840
and each year the UN does publish a

477
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,640
report valuing that gap between the

478
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,220
latest climate pledges and the the Paris

479
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,200
agreement goals and last year and

480
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,059
conclude that the world is falling very

481
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,799
much short

482
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,320
so the report finds that the updated

483
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
pledges would probably result in the

484
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,340
warming of around 2.7 degrees Celsius

485
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,380
just think about that if implemented

486
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,720
effectively though like net zero Mission

487
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,360
pledges could limit the warming to 2.2

488
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,000
degrees Celsius closer to the well below

489
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,860
2 degrees Celsius goal of the Paris

490
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,880
agreement

491
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,940
so once again we're at 1.2 chances are

492
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,760
we're not going to hit we will go to 1.5

493
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,580
but it won't be in 2050 it'll be

494
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,340
relatively a lot sooner than that

495
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,240
so you're probably wondering okay Chloe

496
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
thanks for telling me how to ruin my

497
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,059
Friday today and my entire weekend

498
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,980
but the thing I wanted to bring this up

499
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,960
is because it is something we don't talk

500
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,140
about in cyber security and yes this is

501
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,880
one of those moments where we don't talk

502
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,520
about Bruno may get stuck in your head

503
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,320
and I'm sorry for all the parents in the

504
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,539
room that are watching this right now I

505
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,760
know you probably hate that song at this

506
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,620
time but the reality is that in cyber

507
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,900
security we don't talk about climate

508
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,840
change and and this is a huge problem

509
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,820
because if we're not talking about it

510
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,580
we're not prepared for it what this

511
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,260
means for us

512
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,780
so even though cyber security is part of

513
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,260
the tech sector in a sense the thing is

514
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,179
we have to think about how are we

515
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,700
causing the situation too

516
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,340
Tech the industry itself it uses lots of

517
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,260
electricity including computer data

518
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,020
centers if much that comes from coal

519
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,000
believe it or not and it creates a

520
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,160
boatload of Planet warming emissions

521
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,140
this is relatively easy problem to solve

522
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,419
if companies use renewable energy which

523
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:13,980
is expanding fast and getting cheaper

524
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,140
like companies like Amazon Google and

525
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,880
Microsoft have also gotten attention for

526
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,280
selling technology to help oil and gas

527
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,860
industry extract fossil fuels which are

528
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,240
a major source of greenhouse gas

529
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
emissions however I believe Google

530
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,220
promised to stop recently

531
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,179
so that's one part next thing is that

532
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,940
it's possible that big tech companies

533
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,039
again are saying themselves voluntarily

534
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,480
targets to forestall National

535
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,880
legislation like on emission standards

536
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,340
we see that major tech companies have

537
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,500
been lobbying to make sure that there is

538
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,380
no changes to legislation when it comes

539
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,820
to climate change

540
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,340
because it would be bad business for

541
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,580
them

542
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,020
um so like for example the UK and the

543
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,480
European Union they now require

544
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,860
countries to achieve net zero emissions

545
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,559
by 2050 and that's bound to affect Tech

546
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,460
and every other industry as well and for

547
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,520
many companies right now it's like it's

548
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,780
one of those things like if we want to

549
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,780
get net zero emissions by 2050 it means

550
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,700
all companies across industries that

551
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,860
need to participate including companies

552
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,299
or cyber security

553
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,220
so you're probably wondering okay so so

554
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,960
what do you mean by we're not prepared

555
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,760
for climate change and packing cyber

556
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,159
security well think about it this way

557
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,380
we have to protect natural resources

558
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,080
such as water from attackers

559
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,059
you know if attackers can get a hold of

560
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,400
our water resources

561
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,280
we'd be screwed if there's a fire

562
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,840
the other thing is the shift of

563
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,460
employees moving across the country in

564
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,460
the world because of climate refugees

565
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,520
um or you know people in the movement of

566
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,120
people due to severe weather changes

567
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,799
that's going to make an impact on our

568
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,720
business but also on security side as

569
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,640
well increase the weather damages

570
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,860
impacting businesses that's right when

571
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,780
we're having a category three storm

572
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,120
guess what what's happening you're going

573
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,159
to lose electricity you might lose

574
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,200
running water as well

575
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,299
or heat and these are things to think

576
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,620
about how's that going to impact your

577
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,039
businesses if your employees are in a

578
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,320
flooded territories

579
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,220
and or in fires right or even think

580
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,500
about the pandemic remember how covid-19

581
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,320
impacted our businesses so much in 2020

582
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,559
we all have to stay at home and that

583
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,840
shift and that change has happened so

584
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,820
drastically it did impact the business

585
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,760
and the future of the business as well

586
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,919
but it's the other thing is that we have

587
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,140
to think about protecting Aid as well

588
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,780
delivery from attackers so if say for

589
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,520
example we're sending

590
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,080
um Aid to countries that are

591
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,720
experiencing a devastating loss of a

592
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,880
situation due to climate change

593
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,500
we want to make sure that attackers

594
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,440
don't get access to those resources

595
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,500
so I'm having this conversation with you

596
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,260
because we need a plan and I can't be

597
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,880
the only one who's going to come up with

598
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,919
ideas here on what to do

599
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,080
but I do have some suggestions and I'm

600
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,380
hoping that this may help as well so

601
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,059
here's some suggestions to prepare the

602
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,919
future and I just want to give a random

603
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,740
fact here but carbon dioxide if you

604
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,780
didn't know this can last for 1 000

605
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,640
years in your atmosphere it is actually

606
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,640
one of the guesses you cannot remove so

607
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,700
once it's in there it stays there for a

608
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,500
thousand years and the reason I have

609
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,700
this track here is because

610
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,240
transportation is the number one cause

611
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,299
of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S

612
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,460
alone the first thing that we could do

613
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,799
to try to change the situation and start

614
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,600
having conversations about climate

615
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,039
change and how it's going to impact our

616
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,320
industry and our security teams is by

617
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,059
spreading awareness of climate change it

618
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,440
exists we need to have conversations

619
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,360
About It by ignoring the subject nothing

620
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,620
is ever going to get done we're never

621
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,720
going to have Solutions so you'd rather

622
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,280
just have a conversation about until

623
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,960
waiting for it when it's too late to

624
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,299
change anything we need to be prepared

625
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,820
that means I know a lot of us are

626
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,500
hackers in the community and some of us

627
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,380
maybe after this as well but it's all

628
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,559
about protecting resources making sure

629
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,480
that attackers don't get a hold of those

630
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,900
resources we must protect people and

631
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,360
making sure that they have every

632
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,179
resource at their in their in their

633
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,700
hands and being able to get to it

634
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,919
um that means food that means clean

635
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,799
drinking water that means so many things

636
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,440
and it's up to us to really make sure we

637
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,360
take that initiative to make sure that

638
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,980
people are getting the resources that

639
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,059
they need

640
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,799
another thing you could do is get your

641
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,080
companies on board with ESG Frameworks

642
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,480
you may not heard of ESG you may have

643
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,700
but ESG stands for environmental social

644
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,900
government

645
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,299
I'm not government governance on ESG

646
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,039
Frameworks how they work is that they

647
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,620
help companies figure out their

648
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,020
sustainability plan and sustainability

649
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,240
does take in people not just climate

650
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,539
change okay so these are the four ESG

651
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:06,360
Frameworks I recommend looking at one is

652
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,720
the tcfd this is a really good framework

653
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,880
to get your board and your company to be

654
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,679
prepared for what would look like for

655
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,779
your company and its supply chain when

656
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,120
we get to 2 degrees Celsius

657
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,580
so it's a good practice to know what you

658
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,960
need to do and how to plan for the

659
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,080
future I highly recommend it for every

660
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,059
single company to be able to know what's

661
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,559
going to happen in their supply chain

662
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,020
this is going to help reduce those risks

663
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,260
the other one is the with IBC it takes

664
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,720
the U.N sustainability goals that were

665
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,760
launched so the sustainability

666
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,100
development goals sdgs you may hear of

667
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,679
them there were goals that basically the

668
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,500
world signed on to to get to by 2030

669
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,059
yeah we're not going to hit those goals

670
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,679
let's be real we can't get our

671
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,140
governments to come together but the

672
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,760
thing is is that these goals will really

673
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,220
help kind of show us what we need to do

674
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,740
and how companies can take full

675
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,799
advantage of that type of those goals

676
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,380
and make sure that's plugged into their

677
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,080
business as well because the thing that

678
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,940
runs the world it's not necessarily

679
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,820
governments is companies gri is the the

680
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,880
first like ESG framework that we have so

681
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,860
it's great to use SAS B is one for

682
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,620
accounting and finance to know what what

683
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,940
kind of things they need to be aware of

684
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,520
but to be honest I honestly think ESG

685
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,740
used to be esgc because I looked at

686
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,020
their cyber security parts of their

687
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,779
Frameworks and they are terrible

688
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,580
like absolutely terrible it's not like

689
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,500
they don't really have any idea about

690
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,480
cyber security so I started that

691
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,760
conversation end of last year so

692
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,860
hopefully it'll become esgc one day in

693
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,559
the future but for now ESG

694
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,720
you can know your carbon footprint I

695
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,580
absolutely highly recommend if you have

696
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,080
a computer your phone in front of you

697
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,700
feel free to go to this right now it's

698
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,740
called

699
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,580
footprintcalculator.org for individuals

700
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,740
you don't need to sign up or register or

701
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,000
anything like that you could totally

702
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,159
skip if it asks for it you don't need to

703
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,919
do it that's why I put it on here but it

704
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,720
will let you know how many Earths it

705
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,000
would take for you to live your everyday

706
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,320
life

707
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,360
so I really like it because it also

708
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,100
provides recommendations on how you can

709
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,659
cut back as well

710
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,679
and if you're a company there is a ghg

711
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,900
protocol.org and this is a great source

712
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,480
they just released a beta calculator to

713
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,700
know how to calculate your greenhouse

714
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,679
gas emissions oh yeah by the way if you

715
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,260
see ghg it means greenhouse gas

716
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,299
so it's a great calculator to get

717
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,120
involved in and start calculating to

718
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,620
know what your carbon footprint as a

719
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,580
company now let's go into waste so one

720
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,779
of the things that we need to talk about

721
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,260
is waste so in companies we need to

722
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,179
figure out how we reduce our plastic

723
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,240
waste that means I hate to tell you this

724
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,520
but once again don't look at Plastics as

725
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,679
things you can recycle look at it as

726
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,539
things that you will put in the trash

727
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,539
and it'll be in stuck in this planet for

728
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,580
thousands of well not thousands but

729
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,220
it'll be up to A Thousand Years

730
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,860
so just I want you to remember that also

731
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,659
that it most likely will get into a

732
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,340
river and into an ocean and then you'll

733
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,900
get that double-sized Texas it'll be

734
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,840
like triple sized Texas in the ocean so

735
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,900
just remember reduce plastic just think

736
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,340
of plastic as if you have a Twist

737
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,559
between plastic or glass

738
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,899
go glass and we're going to use plastic

739
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,940
reuse it if you get like a you know a

740
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,220
water bottle it's plastic reuse that

741
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,980
sucker reuse it until you can't use it

742
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,860
anymore that's right just keep reusing

743
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,020
it you know that Dasani water bottle

744
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,399
that you hate because let's be real

745
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,799
Dasani with water is disgusting

746
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,320
just drink it and then reuse that water

747
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,360
bottle refill it up in an airport refill

748
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,100
it at your company just keep reusing

749
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,559
that bottle compost the other thing we

750
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,200
could do is in having you know your

751
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,059
trash your recycle bin and the office

752
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:54,600
have a compost one because actually you

753
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,820
couldn't you can basically live on just

754
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,299
having a compost bin and recyclable bin

755
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,880
once again that's if you cut out plastic

756
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,399
in the office I'm not going to go to go

757
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,380
trash freezing because that is up to

758
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,480
your company to do um and to be honest

759
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,240
it is kind of impossible but you could

760
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,279
get close to it just kind of Target that

761
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,820
as as as you're saying reuse containers

762
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,200
so you know when you go in the office

763
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,000
you have paper cups well instead of

764
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,460
paper cups just have mugs and then just

765
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,620
have a dishwasher or like a sink where

766
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,779
people can wash the mugs reusable

767
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,220
containers are really important to use

768
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,100
we don't want to waste remember the best

769
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,260
way how you can take care of our climate

770
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,700
situation

771
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,140
is to reuse over and over and over again

772
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,360
buy snacks in bulk if you are a snack

773
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,799
office

774
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,260
and not in like those individual packets

775
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,200
put in like you know you get these

776
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,020
ginormous uh containers and you can use

777
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,419
that instead

778
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,399
remember trying to go recycle glass

779
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,039
paper products and just buy less believe

780
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,740
it or not you don't have to buy so many

781
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,380
products so one of the things that I

782
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,779
would say is that for example

783
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,659
body lotion face lotion you can actually

784
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,059
use the same product

785
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,340
just look for one that doesn't have any

786
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,200
like fragrance in it and you will be

787
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,240
okay there are some products that

788
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,340
literally say face and body you don't

789
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,140
need to buy a face one because that

790
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,580
means you're going to get a smaller

791
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,899
container you're gonna have to buy more

792
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,820
of those containers when in reality that

793
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,100
look that lotion thing that's for face

794
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,840
and body you could just use that whole

795
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,720
thing and it's just as good the reality

796
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,340
is that we have to start figuring out

797
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,260
how to buy less

798
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,740
that that's the key here if we buy less

799
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,200
less waste that means better for the

800
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,080
planet and better for you and I okay I

801
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,179
am so sorry Wild West hacking Fest but I

802
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,340
have to talk about conferences one of

803
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,659
the things about our industry is that we

804
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,880
have a lot of conferences so one of the

805
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,020
things that we need to talk about is

806
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,760
eliminate all plastic fibers including

807
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,720
swag

808
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,240
I know we love our swag people I I

809
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,580
understand I used to be that I remember

810
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,140
my first year in cyber security I went

811
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,820
to all those conferences oh my God I

812
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,620
took bags of Swag and shirts and then I

813
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,940
didn't use them

814
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,980
and then they ended up in the trash and

815
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,860
then I I donated the shirts but the

816
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,559
reality is we don't need that

817
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,179
so when we're thinking about Swag if

818
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:22,620
you're on a marketing team is trying to

819
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,120
think of things that

820
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,820
you know you can recycle something like

821
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,940
a glass container or aluminum container

822
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,760
but trying to reduce the type of Swag

823
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,620
that's handed out

824
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,659
also having a hybrid version of

825
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,580
conferences is really important as well

826
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,100
because this also reduces Transportation

827
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,039
issues so one more when wherever we're

828
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,779
flying and then driving into a place

829
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,460
this is going to become a problem

830
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,740
because it does increase greenhouse gas

831
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,360
emissions and now you might be thinking

832
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,399
well what happens if I rode in a Tesla

833
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,559
well guess what it really doesn't matter

834
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,659
if you drive a Tesla if your energy

835
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,820
source for you know charging your car

836
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,700
comes from coal so the reality is you

837
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,380
have to just think about these things is

838
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,179
figuring out what is the energy source

839
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,500
in the area

840
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,480
um also when it comes to food how much

841
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,820
was it local how far did you have to go

842
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,580
and get those food so we really want to

843
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,340
know what we're doing that causes these

844
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,140
you know emissions when making decisions

845
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,299
when it comes to conferences

846
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,039
but Wild West hacking Fest did a great

847
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,779
job by making sure that this is a hybrid

848
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,600
version so it definitely does help but I

849
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,559
want to go into a little bit about

850
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,700
t-shirts so swag t-shirts so if you may

851
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,899
not know this but majority of your

852
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:36,120
shirts include plastic fibers and as we

853
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,799
know it takes more than 400 years to

854
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,019
decompose but majority of your shirts

855
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,539
you you know you may donate or you throw

856
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,880
away and it ends up in a land ways but

857
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,320
the reality is that those shirts are

858
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
going to stay there for hundreds of

859
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,799
years and when you think of donating

860
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,539
shirts you think that's going to go to

861
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:53,940
someone in Goodwill but guess what

862
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,240
Goodwill and also the

863
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,580
oh my God what is that one other one

864
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,779
called

865
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,059
it will come to me there's another place

866
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,559
where you can also donate your clothes

867
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,539
at and what ends up happening is they

868
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,399
get sent to developing countries where

869
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,099
it'll end up in their land waste or for

870
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,000
sale

871
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,040
and a majority of our swag t-shirts were

872
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,480
made in sweatshops believe it or not

873
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,119
that includes child labor but also

874
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,760
exposures and chemicals so in cases in

875
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,739
India for example the rivers have become

876
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,399
incredibly polluted because of basically

877
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,179
our our t-shirts t-shirts pants dresses

878
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,099
all that fast fashion is one of those

879
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,020
things so when we're getting t-shirts

880
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,119
we're getting them from

881
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,020
one place and what's happening is we buy

882
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,960
in bulk we don't know what is the supply

883
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,300
chain look like for it but usually the

884
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,980
supply chain for many of the Swatch

885
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,159
shirts that we get they are going pure

886
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,859
shirt and the material that came with

887
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,899
at least went to five different

888
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,720
countries so that's Transportation all

889
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,640
the way around and this causes a lot of

890
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,080
CO2 emissions that's why there's a lot

891
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,420
to talk about fast fashion and all our

892
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,580
t-shirts that we get at swag you know at

893
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,520
conferences that's usually fast fashion

894
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,200
so if you're wondering what is this

895
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,740
picture this is a second hand clothing

896
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,260
area so this is in Chile and it's in

897
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,420
deserts so what's happened is that fast

898
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,119
fashion has ended up here so every time

899
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,560
that you throw your T-shirt into the

900
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,680
trash or you go and you want to give

901
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,280
away your shirts it ends up here

902
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,960
and this is one of those things to think

903
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,640
about is that this is we're looking at

904
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,099
more than 60 000 tons of clothes or

905
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,560
imported each year that ends up in this

906
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,540
desert landfill and this has

907
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,579
consequences for the environment and the

908
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,380
local community as well

909
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,200
last but not least one of the things

910
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,520
that we need to talk about is that we

911
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,839
need to educate ourselves on what goes

912
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,119
into technology that we buy and what the

913
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,560
climate impacts are and how long a

914
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,240
product might last we can also think

915
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,859
about what we buy in the first place

916
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:58,740
such as like you know we don't need to

917
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,839
always change our iPhone every single

918
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,220
year right

919
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,780
because the thing is we're not thinking

920
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,640
about is the shipping the delivering and

921
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,280
the returning of things but also the

922
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,579
replacing that battery or the items that

923
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,980
go into our devices

924
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,740
so one thing to note is that

925
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,079
invest in your devices keep it until it

926
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,520
no longer works

927
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,680
all right just hold on to your phone as

928
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,180
long as you can you don't need to buy

929
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,800
the latest tech every single year

930
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,320
because you're thinking well I I just I

931
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,000
trade in my phone so then that company

932
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,160
takes my phone and then it gets recycled

933
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,320
guess what there is no actual recycle

934
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,960
program for devices who ends up

935
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,099
happening as they go to developing

936
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,540
countries where they take it apart in

937
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,640
pieces and that glue is really hazardous

938
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,900
to your health

939
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,359
so think about this way

940
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,119
it's not really it's not doing too much

941
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,859
so just think about it

942
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,260
keep the item you have the longest you

943
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,579
can

944
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,640
that's gonna help so much and if if you

945
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,680
do want to get a new product if you're a

946
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,240
company and you have plenty of laptops

947
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,339
that you need to get new ones donate

948
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:03,300
them

949
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,359
donate them to Charities local a lot of

950
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,940
schools could use laptops and computers

951
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,520
it'd be a great way how to do it one of

952
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,660
the other things to think about is to

953
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,700
repair your devices and I know the dmca

954
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,740
is around where it makes it really hard

955
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,079
to repair our own Goods but things are

956
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,060
starting to change such as like apple is

957
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,579
now releasing information on how to

958
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,920
repair your devices slowly so this is

959
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,960
really good for us because then we get

960
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,760
to fix the items that we've purchased

961
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,980
but the last thing I want to talk about

962
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,380
here is the rare materials that go into

963
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,800
this so when we're mining such materials

964
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,320
it's in developing countries and we have

965
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,060
no idea what's going on over there but I

966
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,500
can tell you what has been happening

967
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,839
there most of the time this is done by

968
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,339
children

969
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:49,800
and a lot of times it they are exposed

970
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,000
to violence and not just physical

971
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,339
violence but sexual Vines as well they

972
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,960
don't have proper wages they don't get

973
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,240
breaks and there is no safety along with

974
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,760
it and we need to use rare materials to

975
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,800
you know to make solar panels for

976
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,500
batteries and this is something we don't

977
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,079
talk about enough is that when we're

978
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,119
mining rare materials that's also a

979
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,579
climate change problem but also it's a

980
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,500
Humanity problem

981
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,839
so overall how to get involved on this

982
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,119
and I know this has been a hard talk for

983
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,680
some and maybe some of you you're

984
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,020
probably like I can't handle this it's

985
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,359
not real this can't be real and I I

986
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,540
understand it it is it is insane to

987
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,599
think about it is it's hard it's hard to

988
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,700
acknowledge that this is happening I

989
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,320
mean even for us some of us in the

990
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,359
pandemic are still in shock that we were

991
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,940
even in a pandemic in the first place

992
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,859
but just note that there are some things

993
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,060
that you can do

994
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,000
know your waste know what your what is

995
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,099
your trash get your companies on board

996
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,220
with ESG practices and Frameworks so

997
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,200
they can do things ahead of time to

998
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,060
start getting ready for a two degree

999
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,160
celsius warmer planet

1000
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,560
track your carbon footprint and figure

1001
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,000
out what are ways how you could cut back

1002
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,619
on that yourself it's not just going to

1003
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:03,300
be businesses it's also be on you but

1004
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,700
you can also be a pusher to make sure

1005
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,079
that those things happen in your

1006
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,720
companies ensure events produce low

1007
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,880
emissions and trash you can calculate

1008
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,220
how your conference or event will make

1009
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,380
an impact

1010
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,780
help in by like volunteering to protect

1011
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,180
resources that is something that we

1012
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,099
haven't been talking about yet but we

1013
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:24,839
really need to start figuring out how

1014
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,400
we're going to protect our resources

1015
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,859
such as water and so on and making sure

1016
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:30,480
people get the proper Aid that they need

1017
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,480
from attackers purchase less technology

1018
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,579
that's right just hold on to your phone

1019
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,800
as long as you can until it no longer

1020
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,079
works and it's broken then you can do it

1021
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,900
if you can't fix it keep updated on

1022
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,579
climate change and what's happening the

1023
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,500
UN does publish a report every single

1024
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,099
year about the situation of our planet I

1025
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,200
highly recommend looking at it donate

1026
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,640
your Tech equipment don't assume they

1027
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,320
can be recycled remember from this whole

1028
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,480
takeaway is that nothing is really

1029
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,880
recyclable except for glass and tin and

1030
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,720
paper

1031
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,940
just keep reusing your plastic

1032
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,800
and then spread this talk and talk about

1033
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,960
climate change that's the first thing if

1034
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,520
if you can't do any of that at least

1035
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,920
start talking about climate change start

1036
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,320
talking to people about it because you

1037
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,060
can make a difference

1038
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,859
and I just want to say thank you all for

1039
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,720
existing for catching this talk I know

1040
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,880
that it's you know it's your lunch time

1041
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,740
now at this point I try to go as fast as

1042
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,839
possible but I'm here to answer any

1043
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,660
questions that you have and thank you so

1044
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,480
much for like honestly for for accepting

1045
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,460
this talk we really do need to talk

1046
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,440
about this issue because it's not talked

1047
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,599
about and it's time that we start

1048
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,160
talking about these issues that are

1049
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,380
oppressing ahead of the game so then we

1050
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,540
could be prepared for the future

1051
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,300
happy to take any questions by the way

1052
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,880
I do see one question here in the Q a

1053
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,480
your thoughts on global level

1054
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,859
desalination for more drinking water

1055
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,440
globally and reducing Rising tides

1056
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,140
it's a birthing we have to figure out so

1057
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,380
I know in Israel right now and also in

1058
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,320
Venice they they have the technology to

1059
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,480
make our you know take ocean water and

1060
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,420
make it clean drinking water but it is

1061
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,660
incredibly expensive so I don't know if

1062
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,640
that's going to be happening across the

1063
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,320
U.S that'll be a possibility but I think

1064
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,060
for major cities such as like San

1065
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,099
Francisco Bay Area that's already in

1066
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,500
conversation of what to do because we

1067
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,660
have a shortage of water now

1068
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,579
so that's going to be one of the first

1069
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,140
things

1070
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,359
um on that front the reducing the rising

1071
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,880
tide situation that's more of a

1072
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,040
collective agency across the world of

1073
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,079
cutting back on you know a grid house

1074
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,940
gas emissions because that's you know

1075
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,560
that's warming up our planet and that's

1076
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,500
what's causing with you know the the ice

1077
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,960
sheets to come down or the glaciers and

1078
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,520
so that's one of the things that we have

1079
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,040
to talk about it's it's a two

1080
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,619
two-prong issue drinking water is

1081
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,660
definitely something of need in you know

1082
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,040
especially in California with the

1083
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,760
increase of drought and less rainfall

1084
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,680
um but the rising Tides is one of those

1085
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,720
things through Transportation itself and

1086
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,280
coming back on meat products that would

1087
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,060
be good thank you oh you're welcome if

1088
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,440
anyone has any questions feel free to

1089
