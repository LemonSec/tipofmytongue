1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,140
it was so yeah I was conceited man but

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,300
he's not wrong oh well it wasn't

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,099
conceited at all he's making it work for

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,219
me

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,719
all right coming up next we got Three

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,060
Amigos are you gonna do the dance no all

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,920
right how to tell if your pen test was

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,660
performed by a silent movie star

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,660
if you have that question I mean this is

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,119
your chance to get an answer here's the

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,579
best part of this topic

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,940
I we were discussing wildlife's hacking

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,320
Fest which is one of our favorite

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,719
conferences to go to uh other than the

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,540
fact that it's in [ __ ] Deadwood

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,100
um

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,280
takes forever to get there like it's an

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,739
entire day Delta like says when you book

19
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,840
a flight to Rapid City Delta actually

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,520
says are you sure you want to go there

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,680
um but we were talking about it we're

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,120
like hey what should we do and I'm like

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,340
oh I got this great idea for a talk the

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,979
talk is going to be about how shitty pen

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,500
tests keep happening because the reality

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,760
is

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,820
the vast majority of pen tests out there

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
and please note I am not saying mine are

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,140
not

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,979
the vast majority of pentas out there

31
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,200
suck donkey balls

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,939
that's the type of candy for all you

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,258
inappropriately minded people

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,460
are politicians to be calls and yet we

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,079
keep electing them

36
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,000
right the same thing happens in the pen

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,880
test industry and so I'm talking to my

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,520
people like I got people now this is

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,259
weird for me I forgot I was supposed to

40
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,500
stay over here I'm sorry he just told me

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,420
where I was allowed to walk to and I

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,860
forgot already hope you guys weren't

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,200
expecting a professional talk at this

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,820
one uh

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,640
we're just gonna go off and do things

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,500
but so I'm talking about people like hey

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,700
I got this idea we're going to talk

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,799
about how shitty pen tests are and how

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,079
we can make pen tests better and how you

50
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,360
all who are hiring people to do pen

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,000
tests or doing pen test yourself can

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
hold our own feet to the fire so we can

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,480
do better

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,340
because the reality is we have to do

55
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,379
better we have to improve this because

56
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,120
the world sucks

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,160
right and I talk to customers and

58
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,140
they're like hey I'd like to do a pen

59
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,879
test but please don't touch this [ __ ]

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,340
over here because it falls over and I'm

61
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,560
like did you tell the Chinese and

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,520
they're like

63
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,620
how would we do that I'm like that's the

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,860
point right and we keep letting people

65
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,780
do this stuff so I said to my team I got

66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,300
an idea I'm going to do a talk entirely

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,920
based on the movie Blazing Saddles

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,920
and they said don't do that

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,239
and I'm like

70
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,000
why it's a great movie and they're like

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,580
Kevin so we talked about a little bit we

72
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,080
decided that blazing battles might not

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,260
be the best idea so I read the synopsis

74
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,340
of Three Amigos on Wikipedia and decided

75
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,260
it'd fit my dog

76
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,660
this is where I shouldn't admit I've

77
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,640
never seen the movie

78
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,879
so I know I know I know so this talk

79
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,340
might be a stretch okay like when we

80
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,900
finish this dog and you're like [ __ ]

81
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,480
Kevin that was bad that had nothing to

82
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,760
do with the movies but the idea behind

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,560
the movie according to Wikipedia and we

84
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,900
know everything on the internet's true

85
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,599
birds are real damn it

86
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,799
I'm just saying

87
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,900
you have three silent movie stars

88
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,580
that were fired from their job because

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,440
their movie bailed bombed whatever the

90
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,140
word is right and then they went off and

91
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,319
there was this Village that was being

92
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,420
ransacked by Bandits and the villagers

93
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,640
because we always treat villagers in

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,700
movies like idiots right there's never a

95
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,580
smart group of villagers in movies

96
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,140
I've been to Villages they're smart

97
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,239
people there it's just not movies

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
they thought these movie stars were real

99
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,980
heroes

100
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,260
and they hired them to protect the city

101
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,879
the town The Village

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
the next day the bandits show up because

103
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,819
of course they do it was in the movie

104
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,700
and the script so they had to show up

105
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,699
and the movie stars thought it was a

106
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,279
stunt show and they did a front show and

107
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,959
then one of them got shot I was like oh

108
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,060
[ __ ] that was real

109
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,040
and they like ran away and then they got

110
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,380
captured by like the bandits and all

111
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,660
this stuff the woman who was the you

112
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,220
know it's always in those movies there's

113
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,720
always this woman that is in the village

114
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,820
and everybody loves her and right she

115
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,280
gets kidnapped and then the movie stars

116
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,020
have to go rescue her and they go rescue

117
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,699
her and they bring her back and and the

118
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,160
model of this is

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,419
stop hiring people to do jobs they

120
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,240
aren't qualified to do

121
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,600
and the problem is how do you judge

122
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,720
whether they are qualified right you

123
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,580
can't just look at their uniform because

124
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,639
these guys had the flashy Sombrero in

125
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,520
the sparkly clothes that that I guess

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,919
the story decider was a hero and that's

127
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,960
what they did and we have pen testers

128
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,300
and we have security people that are the

129
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,639
fancy ones they wear the cool straw

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,440
cowboy hats I just had to pick on

131
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,259
Giovanni for a second but

132
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,240
that you know you talk to the pen tester

133
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,620
and they come in and they tell you stuff

134
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,380
like well like Kerber roasted the ldap

135
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,680
symbol star and then I took control of

136
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,880
the NFS SMB mount with my TCP one packet

137
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,539
own system with my double xss blind SQL

138
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,520
injection right these are what and

139
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,160
you're like oh man so [ __ ] cool and

140
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,100
you hire that idiot right and we made it

141
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,720
even worse because the entire I.T

142
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,000
industry the entire infosec industry is

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,520
full of acronyms right we have so many

144
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,120
acronyms we have an acronym to call out

145
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,660
acronyms TLA three-letter acronym

146
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,820
do you know why we have so many acronyms

147
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,360
anybody

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,340
we were bullied in high school

149
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,199
and now the bullies have to ask us what

150
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,240
the hell those letters mean

151
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,520
gives us the power

152
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,320
sticks and stones may not hurt me but

153
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,000
well they would but you know what I mean

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,520
the acronyms will screw you up

155
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,460
and so we and people are afraid to ask

156
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,139
I talk to people I was actually at a

157
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,639
place and I was working with this

158
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,139
company and this group of people and

159
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,520
they were good people they were smart

160
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,740
people and they were really good at

161
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,259
networks and stuff like that right

162
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,340
but they didn't know anything about

163
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,479
security

164
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,740
when I'm almost decided their office

165
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,259
they had the shell coders handbook right

166
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:38,340
for the people who don't know the shell

I got so much stuff in Shell Code I am

195
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,120
like the king of Shell Code

196
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280

197
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,479

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,460
really

202
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,319
I'm gonna tell you right now I've been

203
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,479
involved in security for a very long

204
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,280
time like I said I'm an old fat guy I've

205
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,139
been involved in I.T professionally

206
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,500
since 1991. I've been doing this for 31

207
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,940
plus years

208
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,160
okay

209
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,160
I write Shell Code I've written payloads

210
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,680
for buffer overflows and format string

211
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,979
attacks I've written them from scratch

212
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,919
I know assembly

213
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,819
and I could not finish the shell coders

214
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,280
handbook because the book was so

215
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,280
difficult for me to understand that I

216
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,580
couldn't get through it okay

217
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,080
I talk to these people and what I

218
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,020
realized was not a single one of these

219
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,320
guys had ever read the book

220
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,559
they thought it was a bash shell coding

221
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,760
book

222
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,420
they didn't understand it but none of

223
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,380
them had the courage or honesty

224
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,120
to say

225
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,620
I don't know what the hell I was reading

226
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,680
like I don't know what that was

227
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,959
right yeah you're like what the hell's

228
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,540
wrong with you people right that's what

229
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,279
we're fighting because they're the

230
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,399
people hiring pen testers so we can say

231
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,800
whatever [ __ ] we want to them we can

232
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,839
blow smoke yeah [ __ ]

233
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,320
man I owned you from Timbuktu to leftist

234
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,420
Marlin I don't know what that last part

235
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,839
was let's just go with it right and so

236
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,640
that's what this talk is about yeah that

237
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,920
was a long thing so I'm Kevin for the

238
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,440
people who don't know I'm

239
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm the head nerd at secure ideas right

240
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,480
I'm one of the founders I'm the CEO

241
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,399
which is the fancy way to say head nerd

242
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,720
I'm the dude responsible for everybody

243
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,060
else's mortgage right

244
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,740
um it's really unreasonable every one of

245
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,300
my staff members expects a paycheck

246
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,140
every two weeks it's just ridiculous but

247
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,880
also nice faculty member I'm an open

248
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,519
source project person and my wife says

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,540
this is the nerdiest thing I've ever

250
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,640
done I am a member of the 501st in

251
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Rebelution that is me in those Star Wars

252
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,860
costumes I built the costumes we use

253
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,140
them to raise money for charity I did a

254
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,839
5K in both the Darth Vader and the

255
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,940
Imperial Guard I do want to be clear and

256
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,019
honest I did not run a 5k I slogged that

257
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,180
[ __ ]

258
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,220
it was hot

259
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,440
uh the Chewbacca is my favorite costume

260
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,580
it's awesome I was supposed to bring it

261
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,640
out here uh and did not but that's me

262
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,680
okay I don't think you came here to hear

263
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,180
about me I think you came here to hear

264
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,880
about how penetration testing sucks

265
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,800
it does

266
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,580
and I don't care if you're a consultant

267
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,660
an internal team or me

268
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,060
we suck at what we do very often now if

269
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,920
I may say so for myself and this is not

270
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,019
a sales pitch but I will tell you that

271
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,260
at my company our goal is for you to

272
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,660
have the best penetration testing

273
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,700
experience you ever had

274
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,640
even if that means that you get it from

275
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,140
another company

276
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,760
that's why if you go to our website we

277
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
actually list the seven companies we

278
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,959
recommend you hire other than us

279
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,200
obviously we recommend us we like us

280
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,360
right I am a greedy capitalist but like

281
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,579
John says I suck at capitalism

282
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,920
at some point and the problem is we see

283
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,420
this time and time again that they do

284
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,700
these tests I I get tests done on myself

285
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,279
I've had people come in and do we have a

286
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,660
pen test done every year it's good ideas

287
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,380
we we have people test us we've had

288
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,519
companies that have come in and they're

289
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,260
like okay I had this guy once he was a

290
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,820
bug Mountaineer I don't know that's a

291
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,279
real word but it should be right

292
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,079
um he was a security research which

293
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,760
researcher which everybody knows my

294
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,700
opinion security researcher is often the

295
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,100
another phrase for criminal

296
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,339
um but not all security researchers just

297
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,500
many of them oh [ __ ] I got caught I was

298
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,240
researching where's your lab coat

299
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,360
[ __ ] but

300
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,220
this guy sends us a message and he's

301
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,660
like hey You're vulnerable to heart

302
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,800
bleed

303
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,899
I'll be honest I saw that and I'm like

304
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,160
[ __ ]

305
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,019
we're a security company

306
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,820
we've got some of the best consultants

307
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,100
in the world Kathy's one of them she

308
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,300
just walked in so I got to call her out

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,680
and embarrass her right

310

we've got some of the best pin dancers

311
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,560
in the world how did we miss heart bleed

312
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,540
on our systems

313
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,660
that vulnerability had a [ __ ] logo

314
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,720

315

317
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,779
nobody's ever created one right like a

318
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,120

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,440
vulnerable heart played and he sent me

330
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,399
proof

331
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,139
and I looked at the proof and what found

332
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,260
out was this Jack hole

333
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,180
had run nmap in debug mode with the

334
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,040
script to find heartblade

335
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,220
the output said

336
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,279
not vulnerable to heartbreak

337
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,860
and right underneath that was the debug

338
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,220
mode output of the handshake for the TLs

339
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,620
connection right and have you ever how

340
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,519
many people here have looked at the

341
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,620
debug mode and nmap of the TLs handshake

342
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,399
right

343
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,500
okay okay way more hands should have

344
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,200
come up okay but thank you thank you

345
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,100
very much right it looks if you don't

346
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,860
know what you're doing and I'll call it

347
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,360
ignorance and I want to be very clear

348
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,639
when I say ignorance I don't mean the

349
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,680
social media meaning of ignorance which

350
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
is an insult I mean the lack of

351
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,399
knowledge

352
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,160
we are born in ignorance we will die in

353
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,180
ignorance

354
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,639
the question is what do we do to solve

355
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,579
the ignorance and this Jack hole didn't

356
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,200
try to solve it

357
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,760
so I wrote back to him I'm like hey dude

358
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,620
you know I appreciate you know I do I do

359
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,980
I appreciate you helping us out except

360
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,040
and I got to document how to use nmap

361
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,500
for some weirdo on the internet

362
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,579
and I did it why because I believe we

363
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,920
should educate people right Rising Tides

364
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,200
float all boats for some other Trope

365
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
like that

366
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,800
and so I told them like this is what

367
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,620
this means he wrote back rude that's not

368
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,860
true

369
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,240
[ __ ] you I don't I don't know what else

370
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,180
to say right like here would you like

371
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,399
the link to the documentation you should

372
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,339
have read before you sent me an email

373
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,940
because I got to waste half my day

374
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,100
panicking why did I panic because I

375
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,440
assume I screwed it up

376
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,940
I've broken more of our production

377
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,519
systems than anybody else in the company

378
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,880
the CEO should not have admin rights

379
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,880
nobody's taking them away from me

380
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,579
right this is the problem we do these

381
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:00,839
things and we don't have a good

382
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,300
definition of pen testing which is not

383
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,820
true I just lied to all of you

384
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,279
we do have a good definition we don't

385
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,600
enforce it

386
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,899
we let any Jackal marketer say this is a

387
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,120
pen test it looks a lot like the end map

388
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,000
uh the nessus output well yes but it's

389
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,880
our specialness server it's kind of like

390
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,440
the football special teams did you guys

391
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,100
know that's a thing

392
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,420
specialness is output what does that

393
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,899
mean oh we replaced the logo with ours

394
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:34,800
that's not special that's plagiarism but

395
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,680
we allow people to Define pen tests as

396
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,660
things they aren't

397
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,579
and then we accept them

398
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:42,959
how many times have you met somebody at

399
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,519
a conference like this and you say to

400
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,740
them hey what do you do and the guy says

401
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,079
don't answer that the guy says because I

402
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,279
want to be clear like I don't want to

403
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,660
embarrass this dude if he says what I'm

404
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,639
about to say he says I'm a pen tester

405
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,199
you're like really

406
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,260
Bic or fountain

407
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,519
and they don't get the joke but

408
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,860
really you're a pen tester yeah what do

409
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,079
you use like what what do you do as a

410
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,240
pen tester well I open opened that

411
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,600
server okay that was your first mistake

412
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,420
um I use math scan okay that's good

413
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,560
that's good what do you do with Matt

414
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,339
scan I look for vulnerabilities

415
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,019
with math scan

416
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,279
yes

417
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,260
you talk to Robert lately because I

418
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,360
don't think he thinks it does that and

419
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,699
he wrote it

420
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,740
he might be wrong

421
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,560
but I don't think so right so we have

422
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,600
these people so here's the thing I

423
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,459
believe and I want to be very clear I

424
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,779
want to be very clear because you guys

425
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:40,800
are going to look at the next slide and

426
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,779
you're gonna be like no [ __ ] you

427
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:44,279
timed it that way just because the talks

428
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,680
called Three Amigos that's not why I

429
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,160
have three reasons why we suck at pen

430
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,620
tests okay and it's not because it's

431
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,180
really goes but it fit

432
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,720
quality validation and understanding

433
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,820
and they are a pyramid

434
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,440
I believe the first problem that we need

435
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
to address the first problem we can

436
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,579
address is the quality of what we get

437
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,059
when we do a pen test or hire for a pen

438
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,079
test the second problem in my opinion is

439
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,359
why that first problem exists because

440
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,179
most people don't know how to

441
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,679
Val validate sorry my internet

442
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,339
connections down the validates

443
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:28,319
the findings they get

444
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,460
and then in my opinion again the reason

445
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,460
we are able to push out [ __ ] that isn't

446
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,260
validated is because people don't have

447
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,700
an understanding of what they're looking

448
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,780
at how how how how many people

449
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,240
how many people have looked at an

450
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,340
Essence report of 2500 pages

451
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,919
and thought to themselves oh [ __ ] what

452
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,059
do I do

453
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,980
which is why we look at criticals and

454
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,660
highs first right

455
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,919
but I'll tell you right now here's the

456
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,000
problem with looking at criticals and

457
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,679
Heights first how many people here love

458
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,260
John strand right

459
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,020
I mean I know he's your boyfriend but um

460
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,480
we love John strand

461
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,200
John strand said nine years ago and I

462
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,280
know it was nine years ago because it

463
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,840
was my 40th birthday and he and I were

464
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,820
on stage at RSA

465
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,059
he said nine years ago and he said it

466
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,980
before that too but nine years ago he

467
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,740
said on stage that the vast majority of

468
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,840
exploits he does the vast majority of

469
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,960
the results he gets aren't from critical

470
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
and high vulnerabilities they're from

471
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,440
low and informational

472
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,360
and he's right

473
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,960
and he told us that [ __ ] nine years ago

474
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
and we're still not doing it I actually

475
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,240
have customers nope that's not true

476
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,640
that's a lie I have companies that would

477
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,860
like to be customers but I won't hire

478
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,780
them as a customer

479
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,460
because they want me to write a report

480
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,020
that's just all the critical and high

481
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,340
findings

482
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,740
nothing that's low in medium

483
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,360
well you're a [ __ ] you're not actually

484
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,340
trying to fix [ __ ] you're protecting

485
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,100
against auditors

486
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,200
we don't look at this stuff

487
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,299
so quality is the first problem

488
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,100
right off the bat we don't have real

489
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,260
good scan results

490
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,140
or the flip side of that

491
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,900
we're just scanning

492
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,500
we run nessus pen test

493
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,000
just because you were clicking a pen

494
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
while you ran nessus does not make it a

495
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,360
pen test

496
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,340
by the way I can say that because I am a

497
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,000
professional pen tester and Pen maker

498
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
um

499
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,820
we don't we do these scans everybody

500
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,679
does it I'll be right I'll be blunt

501
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,780
secure ideas when we scan a large

502
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,539
Network we do scans

503
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,340
we do we have to to find out what's

504
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,160
there what hosts exist

505
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,380
s but if that's all we did

506
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,240
I would put us in the category of Jack

507
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,660
hole

508
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,620
and I don't put us in that category I

509
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,179
like us

510
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,299
right I'm biased I'll admit it

511
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,840
we don't have good tooling

512
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,039
and worse

513
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,620
we depend on the tooling we as an

514
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,940
industry

515
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,620
we depend on the tooling

516
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,679
how many people here have pulled off SQL

517
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,100
injection exploitation not discovery

518
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,260
exploitation

519
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,760
with just a browser

520
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,320
again more hands should have gone up

521
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,220
in my opinion even if you're not a pen

522
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,419
tester because I am going to pick on

523
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:34,740
Giovanni right now I hope you don't mind

524
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,080
Giovanni is not a pen tester that's not

525
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,500
his job he's capable of pen testing he'd

526
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,419
be good at it if he was one but he's not

527
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,120
it's not his job but he raised his hand

528
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,799
because he's done SQL injection

529
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,440
exploitation in a browser so he

530
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,419
understands it better he doesn't depend

531
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,760
on the tooling and because he doesn't

532
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,039
depend on the tooling when he gets the

533
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,660
results of the tooling he understands

534
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,400
what it's doing he understands the

535
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,580
limitations of the tool how many people

536
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,160
here use zap The Zed attack proxy to

537
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,200
intercept traffic okay great that's

538
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,460
awesome now let me ask you a question

539
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,440
how many people here have websites that

540
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,960
support HV 2.0

541
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,000
okay I will point out that some of the

542
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,980
same hands went up how many people here

543
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,559
are aware that Z attack proxy does not

544
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,440
and has no plans for the near future to

545
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,200
support hdb 2.0

546
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,720
very few hands went up

547
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,340
they're working on it

548
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,480
but it's going to take effort and

549
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,740
they're volunteers

550
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,620
okay so what we have is a group of

551
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,100
people who support HP 2.0 yet use a tool

552
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,679
that doesn't support the technology they

553
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,059
use

554
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,380
and we know there are bypasses

555
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,299
that can be done

556
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,460
if the control system is based around

557
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,840
1.1 or 1.0 and you're using two

558
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,780
and so you I don't mean to be mean

559
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,940
but you are depending on tooling that

560
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,880
can't do what you need it to do and I

561
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,140
love zap

562
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,419
I recommend it as long as you understand

563
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,140
the limitations of the tool

564
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,960
do you buy an iPhone and take it scuba

565
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,580
diving

566
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,080
no

567
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
is it water resistant I don't know

568
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,260
probably I'm an Android person

569
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,900
but it's not the tool for that

570
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,880
but in in infosec we use it all the time

571
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,799
same thing how many people here get a

572
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,299
pen test or work for a company that gets

573
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,799
a pen test once a year

574
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,720
or more than once a year at least once a

575
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,440
year right okay cool how many of you

576
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,679
believe or have talked to your pen

577
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,679
testers at any other time during the

578
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,299
year except when you're trying to buy

579
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,880
the pen test from them

580
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,220
very few hands I'm glad to see someone

581
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,179
up

582
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,220
you should partner with your pen testers

583
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,620
and if your pen test firm isn't willing

584
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,480
to talk to you unless there's an sow in

585
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,059
place [ __ ] them

586
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,740
those are the ones that should be set on

587
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,600
fire and then don't pee on them to put

588
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,959
them out

589
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,440
it's ridiculous oh no man I charge 300

590
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,840
an hour retail we got some discounts in

591
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,419
there some of that crap we charge 300 an

592
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,520
hour as a pen tester

593
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,020
you call me to do a pen test I'm gonna

594
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,760
scope it up ah you know blah blah blah

595
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,440
man new client discount twenty eight

596
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,240
thousand eighty dollars

597
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,559
twenty eight thousand eighty dollars for

598
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,659
a pen test a five-day pen test two

599
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,220
Consultants by three days of reporting

600
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,539
okay

601
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,520
yes I did that in my head

602
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,000
not really I have the number memorized

603
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,700
that's a 10 discount so the rate's 270.

604
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,120
okay

605
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,240
I do my pen test my team does it we

606
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,919
deliver the report

607
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,720
three months later you finally get

608
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,220
somebody in management to talk to you

609
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,960
and you're fixing something and you

610
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,000
don't know what to do after you fix it

611
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,159
do you know what you can do

612
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,159
you can call me you can email me you can

613
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,080
join my slack workspace and talk to me

614
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,179
directly you could show up at my office

615
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,559
and knock on the door we have a ring

616
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,700
doorbell but it's really annoying so

617
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,679
please don't ring it

618
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,960
and you can talk to my staff we have a

619
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,820
slack workspace so we give an SLA of 30

620
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,500
minutes during business hours to get you

621
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,240
a response to what's going on and I'm

622
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,460
not telling you this for you to hire me

623
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,620
I'm telling you this so you can expect

624
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,740
that level of [ __ ] from every [ __ ]

625
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,780
pen tester you work with

626
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,179
because I will tell you I've worked with

627
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,520
pen testers in other companies where

628
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,320
I've called them and said I work for a

629
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,640
company Blue Cross or Blue Shield

630
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,340
Florida that I was one of their admins

631
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,740
we got a pen test from a company that I

632
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,960
won't tell you

633
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,580
was Secure works

634
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,740
I think I might have told you

635
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,520
they sent us the pandas report it was a

636
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,799
47 page report

637
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,840
30 of the pages outlined the

638
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,419
vulnerabilities in the Coca-Cola Network

639
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,419
I hope you noticed I said I worked for

640
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,140
Blue Cross of Blue Shield of Florida

641
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,179
that is spelled very different than

642
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,280
Coca-Cola

643
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,500
no I don't know if those vulnerabilities

644
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,900
were really coca-colas or if that's some

645
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,360
code name they use for Blue Cross but

646
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,460
the IPS didn't match anything we knew

647
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,760
foreign

648
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:22,320
check marks is worse they suck don't

649
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,460
ever buy check marks but

650
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,260
this is the problem we don't partner

651
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,659
with our pen testers we don't work with

652
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,700
them our pen testers come in they beat

653
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,039
us up they tell us our baby is ugly and

654
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,860
they go home

655
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,419
they should be talking to you on a

656
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,600
regular basis I as a pen tester should

657
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,419
know what changes you are making in the

658
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,340
next release of your application that I

659
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,240
tested last week why because I hope that

660
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,679
when you come to me before it goes to

661
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,440
production in a month that I'm ready to

662
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,539
do the test with the knowledge of the

663
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,279
change tickets you've got

664
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,500
and I know I've heard this [ __ ] but

665
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,299
Kevin the real hackers wouldn't have

666
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,919
access to our change channel system yes

667
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,919
they [ __ ] do

668
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,400
they have access to your systems

669
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,120
and if they don't they should

670
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,279
because if that's your excuse not to

671
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,620
give the pen tester information

672
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,760
you were undermining your own success

673
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,860
stop doing it

674
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,679
so we need quality

675
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,740
which brings me to experience sorry I

676
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,299
skipped that one how many people here

677
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,799
are higher pen testers right out of

678
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,120
college

679
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,940
yeah stop doing that

680
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,679
I know I know I'm going to be accused of

681
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,960
gatekeeping I'm not gatekeeping

682
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,299
I want to hire people straight out of

683
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,880
college and have done it

684
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,220
that's okay

685
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,799
but have a plan to teach them and pair

686
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,380
them with somebody who has built and

687
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,679
managed actual Enterprises not because

688
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,900
that person out of college can't handle

689
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,179
it they're probably smarter than I am I

690
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,440
barely made it out of high school

691
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,240
my teachers from elementary school and

692
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,640
high school are shocked

693
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,460
that I've taught at Princeton

694
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,799
that was a fun procurement Department

695
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,900
where did you get your doctorate

696
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,440
oh my GP is Dr Smallwood

697
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,940
that was my pediatrician it's the only

698
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,559
doctor I can think of

699
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,179
it's a long time since I went to a

700
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,720
pediatrician

701
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,900
they didn't think I was funny

702
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,000
give them the experience let them know

703
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,559
stuff let them know how to manage stuff

704
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,779
which brings us to validation

705
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,640
right first one that everybody's worried

706
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,679
about false positive I generate a report

707
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,240
I send it over to the customer they look

708
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,100
at it and they go uh-huh nope nope nope

709
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,539
nope got a false positive right here

710
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:49,980
that's not real

711
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,720
really that's not real I was testing

712
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,460
this one system I won't say who it was

713
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,740
no joke there I'm really not gonna

714
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,679
I know you're waiting

715
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,500
I dumped three and a half million Social

716
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,779
Security numbers from a database

717
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,580
right and in this case I was told I had

718
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,559
to actually transfer the data normally

719
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,000
we don't transfer that level of data I

720
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,320
don't want the liability I don't want

721
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,179
your customer Social Security numbers on

722
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,460
my laptop

723
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,679
but I dumped them I go in I'm in a

724
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,720
meeting we're doing a debrief I tell the

725
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,059
the I.T people yeah you know I got on

726
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:26,460
the knock Rock 0860 woo 53 SQL

727
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,360
no you didn't

728
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,880
no I I did

729
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,919
like here's the data here's the table

730
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:37,380
structure his name and server here's

731
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,700
where it is in the data center it's on

732
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,340
the third rack from the left five up I

733
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,679
exaggerated on that last part

734
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,360
I mean I had broken into their data

735
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,260
center but I didn't know where that

736
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,880
specific server was

737
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,980
the guard let us in but

738
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,960
like no you didn't yeah I did there is

739
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,700
no way you dumped data from that

740
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,140
database is it okay

741
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,840
okay yeah I get it I get it I get it I'm

742
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,000
telling you your baby is ugly which by

743
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,779
the way

744
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:07,320
I have kids all babies are ugly we lie

745
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,020
to you and tell you your baby is cute

746
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,340
we do

747
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,140
they're scrunchy and they're weird

748
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,980
colors and they make noise

749
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,840
I will say one noise they make it's the

750
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,760
best sound in the world the laugh of a

751
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,419
baby is so joyful unless it's like 3 A.M

752
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,539
and you don't have kids but

753
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,419
and it's [ __ ] weird

754
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,159
we tell you your baby's ugly and you

755
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,020
don't want to admit it so you say we

756
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,580
didn't hack you okay great so I'll ask

757
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,840
you a question do you have that server

758
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,960
yes okay does it have a database on it

759
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,700
called this yes

760
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,299
does it have Fields called this yes

761
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,220
here's 10 sample Social Security numbers

762
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,940
are they in that database yes okay let's

763
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,840
weigh our options I don't know guys

764
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,700
here's the choices

765
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,220
Kevin successfully compromised the

766
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,500
system

767
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,679
or Kevin successfully guessed

768
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,919
all of that information correctly

769
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,779
you pick

770
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,159
people want to claim it's a false

771
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,159
positive sometimes it is we've had false

772
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,720
positives

773
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,760
right but you got to Rule now you got to

774
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,080
understand how to Value you have to look

775
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,940
at what it is okay if this is a false

776
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,320
like for example we talked about this in

777
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,399
class yesterday

778
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,500
you're doing a TLS scan and it tells you

779
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,320
you're running TLS version 37 minus

780
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,299
three or something I know that's not a

781
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,500
real version

782
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,240
and it's vulnerable to this you don't

783
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,980
have to validate that I mean you would

784
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,840
if it said 37 minus three because that's

785
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,520
not real but if it tells you you're

786
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,919
running TLS 1.0 it probably you are

787
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,600
running tls1.

788
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,360
right the scanners for that are pretty

789
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,500
robust

790
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,120
I'm going to validate that I'm also not

791
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,140
going to call it a high-risk finding

792
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,700
unless you're PCI Compliant your auditor

793
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,340
is a joke but

794
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,320
but if I find a SQL injection flaw

795
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,659
here's how I proved it here's how I do

796
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,700
this okay look at that then we've got

797
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,919
false negatives this is the one that

798
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,179
should scare you more than false

799
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,039
positives and it doesn't scare most

800
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,720
people more most people are like oh

801
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,220
false positives my auditor is going to

802
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,299
give me a hard time I got all these

803
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,880
reports no a false negative means I

804
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,320
missed it

805
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,299
I don't know of a vulnerability you have

806
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:21,600
and you don't know about it either

807
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,880
you know how we figure those ones out

808
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,620
we go back to Quality

809
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,020
we test better we work better we

810
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,740
cooperate

811
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,340
here's what I think everybody's all

812
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,140
heard about purple teaming and red

813
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,779
teaming and blue teaming and uh I don't

814
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:38,340
remember oh my God I'm blanking on her

815
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,320
name she came up with the color wheel of

816
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,059
infosec and it's been plagiarized by

817
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,279
some shitty companies but

818
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,000
um

819
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,919
it's got orange Jimmy and yellow teaming

820
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:47,940
all these kind of things could we just

821
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,980
stop with the colors and call it teaming

822
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,659
because that's what we should do we

823
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,520
should team here's hey you got this i

824
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,659
got this well let's work on it together

825
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,880
let's build out what we're doing

826
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,559
and that will let us work out false

827
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,240
negatives it will also move us to

828
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,919
thresholds

829
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,320
I had a customer argue with me that

830
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,360
because their policy said eight

831
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,279
characters was long enough on a password

832
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:11,159
it was a false positive to ding them on

833
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,600
a shitty password policy

834
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,320
I don't know what to say to that did you

835
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,299
detect my Brute Force attack that logged

836
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,460
in as a domain admin no your thresholds

837
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,240
are wrong

838
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,240
yeah where are you alerting we didn't do

839
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,320
any alerting because you gave us our

840
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,120
your IP addresses so we we muted all

841
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,320
those alerts

842
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,640
why

843
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,880
I mean don't call the FBI but you

844
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,059
know you're alerting saw me

845
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,600
I don't know should we have yes

846
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,820
the reality is you should know let me

847
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,100
ask you a question yeah who is willing

848
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,320
to answer a question for me right now

849
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,179
okay great anybody else other than

850
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,520
Giovanni you'll do it okay good here's

851
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,380
the question for me what type of company

852
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,120
do you work for do not tell me who you

853
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,279
work for

854
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:01,559
Financial even better

855
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,419
do you have uh do they transfer money

856
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:04,740
back and forth in their accounts or

857
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,640
something

858
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,760
I'm sorry no no do your clients transfer

859
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,760
money great how many transfers a day

860
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,940
happen on your production systems

861
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,559
don't answer

862
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,519
here's the question do you know or know

863
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,260
where to find out

864
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,299
exactly how many transactions of that

865
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,679
type happen on your system in a day

866
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,760
answer we should use his financial

867
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,700
services company whatever it is

868
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,539
okay

869
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,700
I'm sorry

870
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,279
yeah we shouldn't use Wells Fargo that

871
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,899
was a Joel because he said Wells Fargo

872
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:46,200
not me I did after he said it but that's

873
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,640
great most companies don't know how many

874
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,440
transfers do you have a day I don't know

875
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,480
how many of that page hit do you get a

876
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,399
day how many people log in successfully

877
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,919
on your system a day

878
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,659
do you know how to test your Dr plan you

879
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:58,740
know people say to me all the time how

880
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,179
do I test whether we would detect an

881
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:01,620
incident

882
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,500
well have you been hacked lately

883
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,140
no then you are incapable of detecting

884
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,159
an incident

885
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,040
but that's depressing

886
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,379
how do we test it here's how you test it

887
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,260
pick a transaction the transfer of money

888
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,060
start from the client all the way to the

889
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,040
backend system and then back up pick one

890
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,060
transaction

891
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,980
trace it through the entire system a

892
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,119
successful one

893
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,239
if you can trace one of your important

894
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,940
transactions from client to servers and

895
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,899
back

896
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:34,260
you can detect an incident

897
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,599
probably

898
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,940
but if you can't do that for your real

899
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,399
business you aren't even able to begin

900
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,960
looking at how to figure out the

901
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,839
thresholds for security incidents you

902
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,418
can't do it I mean you can you can make

903
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:51,480
up numbers 42. every time we have 42 of

904
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,219
something that's the answer

905
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:56,280
right you know it is

906
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,800
so figure it out which brings us to the

907
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,160
last thing

908
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,420
you know I had to do it right here's the

909
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,599
problem

910
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,160
if I call you ignorant are you insulted

911
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,540
now if I called you a [ __ ] ignorant

912
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,920
fool you'd be insulted but that's

913
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,800
context right if I call you ignorant

914
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,200
more people online I have used the term

915
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,480
ignorance I'm ignorant

916
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,460
we hear in the infosec field that we

917
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,800
have imposter syndrome

918
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,720
once the psychologist has told you you

919
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,160
have imposter syndrome you probably

920
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,240
don't

921
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,220
and here's why I say that

922
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,339
imposter syndrome is you feel like you

923
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,400
know so much less than anybody else does

924
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,040
and you're pretending to know to be in

925
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,660
the position you're in now you may be

926
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,760
that way but to me that's a scammer

927
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,320
Kevin mitnick should have imposter

928
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,079
syndrome because he's a scumbag

929
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,859
you have ignorance and here's the

930
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:57,599
problem when I decided I want to get

931
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,280
involved in security I was an admin I

932
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,900
was a developer I thought that hacking

933
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,460
stuff man it was gonna be so much fun

934
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,000
this would be cool let's do it right

935
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,099
and so I wrote down a list I'm not a

936
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,320
list guy I wrote down a list of 10

937
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,599
things I needed to know to become an

938
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,160
information security person I actually

939
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,020
talked to my poor

940
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,400
it's Mike

941
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,380
here's what I want to do what should I

942
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,119
learn and he told me some things I

943
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,000
learned I I got 10 days and I learned

944
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,260
one of the things

945
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,980
I'm so proud really was I passed my gcia

946
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,700
it's too expensive now to buy it

947
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,660
I also don't understand why you would

948
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,040
ever name a security training company

949
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,079
without security but that's a separate

950
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,820
conversation

951
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,300
some eating of Sands

952
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,859
they've got good materials

953
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,420
I know I wrote some of them they're

954
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,960
still usable but

955
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,320
I got my gcia so I had a list of

956
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,200
36 things I needed to learn

957
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,540
because when I learned that one

958
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,540
I found 27 other things I hadn't known

959
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,180
existed

960
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,260
as of last week my list has 4 trillion

961
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,300
387 billion 563 million 947 and a half

962
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,800
items

963
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,859
it didn't make up that number

964
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,720
every time I learned something I learned

965
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,700
more stuff I didn't know that's

966
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,200
ignorance

967
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,140
I'm ignorant of lots of things

968
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,020
stupidity which sadly is way more common

969
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,359
than Common Sense we call it common

970
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:31,740
sense to make ourselves feel better

971
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,118
because it's not that common

972
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,000
50 of the people in the world are

973
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,820
average or below intelligence

974
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,020
that's math

975
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,880
were ignorant until we have the

976
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,859
opportunity to learn and if we ignore

977
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:53,640
that opportunity then we're stupid

978
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,560
don't be stupid

979
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,839
because stupid should hurt

980
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,619
I wish stupid came with a flag

981
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,480
seriously man we got flags for

982
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,280
everything now and I'm thrilled with the

983
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,920
flags we've got I just feel bad that

984
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,720
we've left out probably the most

985
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,099
important one

986
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,599
I'd like all the stupid people to

987
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,880
identify themselves as stupid so I could

988
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,099
stop talking to them

989
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,960
because it hurts the problem is it

990
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,579
doesn't hurt them

991
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:24,060
it hurts the rest of us

992
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,220
and people don't understand what's going

993
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,500
on right and they don't understand I say

994
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,599
I see cyber risks everywhere here's the

995
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,920
problem people see cyber risk all the

996
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,599
time I go cyber is cyber is cyber is

997
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,780
cyber risk we suck at risk detection

998
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,760
let me ask you a question how many

999
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,300
people here are afraid of sharks

1000
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,099
pretty sharks great

1001
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,900
so I'll ask sir

1002
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,280
where do you live what state foreign

1003
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,420
North Dakota

1004
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,380
North Dakota and you're afraid of sharks

1005
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,780
it's a landlocked state

1006
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,400
maybe the only way a shark's getting you

1007
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,079
is if they're transporting it down the

1008
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,440
highway and you hit the [ __ ] truck

1009
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,780
you know what you should be afraid of

1010
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,859
soda machines

1011
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,660
that's reasonable everybody should be

1012
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,400
scared of grizzly bears especially if

1013
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,780
you've seen one shaved have you ever

1014
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,839
seen that thing that's nightmare fuel

1015
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,900
it doesn't matter they're scary as hell

1016
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,579
and they've got legs they can chase you

1017
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,680
the shark you get up on the dock and

1018
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,980
you're like

1019
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,380
you should be afraid of soda machines

1020
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,000
more people in the United States are

1021
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
killed by soda machines a year than

1022
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,839
sharks but Discovery Channel doesn't

1023
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,599
have a soda machine week

1024
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,579
it'd be boring

1025
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,400
and there's the Pepsi

1026
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,980
right because we don't understand risk

1027
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,160
it's like reputational harm how many

1028
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,180
people here have worked for a company

1029
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,619
and they're like man we've got

1030
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:00,300
reputational harm it's really bad we can

1031
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,859
have trepidational harm right how many

1032
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,920
right reputational harm for infosec it's

1033
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,420
a cop-out

1034
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,220
every single time I hear a consultant

1035
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,140
say well the risk of reputational harm

1036
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,540
almost every single time I hear it it

1037
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,339
tells me that that consultant couldn't

1038
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,940
think of a business risk to use and so

1039
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,160
they categorized his reputational harm I

1040
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,300
was teaching a class once I probably

1041
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,380
shouldn't tell the story but I'm going

1042
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,880
to tell the story I was teaching a class

1043
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,859
once and I said that a guy in the

1044
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,020
audience said Kevin you're wrong

1045
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,280
but okay

1046
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,839
I'm okay being wrong I'm wrong all the

1047
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:34,079
time ask Kathy

1048
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,240
we have a contest in slack at work

1049
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,740
should say how many times I'm right

1050
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,180
because it happens so rarely

1051
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,260
I said this guy okay fine he's like my

1052
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,240
company we've studied it we're worried

1053
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,680
about reputational harm

1054
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,480
like really he's like yeah we put a lot

1055
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,040
of money into studying it and we know

1056
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,660
it's the biggest risk we have really who

1057
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,619
do you work for and this [ __ ] said I

1058
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,020
work for Comcast

1059
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,540
and I laughed

1060
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,480
you're worried about reputational harm

1061
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,460
your Comcast Comcast people who have

1062
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,040
never heard of you hate you

1063
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,280
as a customer you have more recordings

1064
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
of me calling your sales people stupid

1065
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,740
[ __ ] than any other company in

1066
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,160
the world

1067
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,440
I hope you get hacked not because I want

1068
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,060
you to be hacked but because the hackers

1069
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,300
would provide better service

1070
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,800
there's no reputational harm there

1071
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,680
people still shop at Target

1072
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,359
people still work with the US government

1073
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,960
even though let's be honest OPM happened

1074
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,000
they got our Biometrics I had to go burn

1075
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,800
all my fingerprints off

1076
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,140
that's not true I mean it didn't get the

1077
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,579
Biometrics I just didn't burn my

1078
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,160
fingerprints off right

1079
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,079
we have to understand the risks we have

1080
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,480
to work on our understanding and then we

1081
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,280
need to go back into town

1082
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,520
see I told you I'd type to the movie

1083
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,740
might be a stretch watch the movie tell

1084
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,180
me if I got it right

1085
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,980
because I didn't

1086
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,540
I have watched Top Gun we had that

1087
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,119
conversation last night

1088
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,760
go back into town

1089
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,500
the next time you're hiring a pen test

1090
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,060
firm the next time you're working for a

1091
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,619
pen test firm the next time you're doing

1092
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,839
pen test of your own company

1093
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,140
think about what I just said

1094
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,940
how do you provide the best quality

1095
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,040
service you can

1096
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,380
how do you enable the people receiving

1097
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,700
the results

1098
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,900
to validate that you're not full of [ __ ]

1099
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,000
and then how do you share the

1100
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,040
understanding so that you don't have to

1101
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,339
be there

1102
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,160
when I started secure ideas I told

1103
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,260
people then that my goal in life in

1104
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,700
business was to put myself out of

1105
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,560
business

1106
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,660
sadly you guys haven't enabled me to do

1107
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,020
that no that's not sad I'm happy

1108
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,440
but my goal is to educate as often as

1109
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,140
possible everywhere I can

1110
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,240
I don't care who you work for like

1111
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,379
unless it's check marks

1112
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,020
not helping them

1113
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,420
don't buy check marks

1114
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,400
I don't care where you work if you're in

1115
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,839
a problem if you've got a question if

1116
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,920
you have something you don't understand

1117
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,579
my email address is Kevin securityos.com

1118
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,500

1119
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,940

workspace you can call me at

1121
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,920
904-403-8024

1122
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:32,400
my social security number is no

1123
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,200
it's been compromised so many times I

1124
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,060
might as well say it

1125
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,800
if you've got a question send me an

1126
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,140
email reach out ask I don't care if

1127
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,960
you're competing with me I don't care if

1128
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,060
you're doing the pen test I bid on and

1129
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,380
lost

1130
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,079
I don't I mean I do I wish I hadn't lost

1131
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,700
it

1132
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,160
but what I want to do is give you the

1133
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,079
information I can and if I don't know

1134
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,920
the answer I got 26 other people who are

1135
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,720
smarter than me

1136
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,880
because that's something I did and this

1137
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,440
is something I'm proud of there are not

1138
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,500
many things in my life that I did that I

1139
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,319
look at and go yes I am proud of every

1140
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,940
aspect of that

1141
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,680
this is one of them

1142
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,440
I am proud of the fact that every single

1143
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,780
person that works at secure ideas is

1144
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,579
smarter than I am

1145
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,099
every single one of them every single

1146
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,560
one of them knows more than I do every

1147
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,260
single one of them is a better person

1148
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,599
than I am because they would have

1149
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,579
forgiven check marks

1150
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:35,460
they would have been wrong

1151
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,859
if I don't know the answer they will and

1152
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:39,420
I'll connect you to them and I won't

1153
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,800
bill you

1154
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,599
because we're not lawyers we don't bill

1155
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,400
when we think about you

1156
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,500
now don't get me wrong I'd like you to

1157
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,819
think about hiring this at some point

1158
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:51,240
but whatever what I want to make sure is

1159
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,280
that you get the best pen test

1160
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,900
experience you can

1161
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,520
and if you're offering the pen test

1162
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,140
experience I hope you're giving the best

1163
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,180
pen test experience you can and if I can

1164
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,280
help you make it better call me it's

1165
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,579
that simple that's it I think

1166
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,160
I got five minutes for questions I think

1167
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,040
right am I right timelines okay I did

1168
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,020
that you know normally I really suck at

1169
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,240
timing it that's what I did right that

1170
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,980
never happens

1171
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,040
so yes sir so

1172
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,460
I am a fantastic and we occasionally

1173
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,160
when we go in to a place where

1174
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,500
somebody's been there before

1175
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,260
occasionally we'll get a prior Year good

1176
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,819
night

1177
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:33,720
yeah

1178
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,060
very rarely

1179
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,160
do we see the good ones that like from

1180
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,599
companies that we know are doing their

1181
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,720
good jobs do you know why that is

1182
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,640
no because when we do good jobs they

1183
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,020
don't hire a different company the next

1184
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,119
year no that's not true I if you want to

1185
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,339
see a good pen test report

1186
00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:51,540
secureideas.com Knowledge Center so

1187
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,160
that's where you can ask it's like you

1188
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,420
see like

1189
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,500
yeah like the not so good stuff I mean

1190
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,819
but we don't we like to learn from

1191
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,619
others and it's like how so you share

1192
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,420
yours and it's like it's almost like

1193
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,880
this secret obviously it's meant to be

1194
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,440
it's IP and Secret Sauce whatever no

1195
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,819
it's not Secret Sauce please don't say

1196
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:09,720
that

1197
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,839
God no no no it's not

1198
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,599
let me be very clear my report of the

1199
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,619
test I did for that dude is secret right

1200
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,540
because that's theirs I gave it to them

1201
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,480
it's like kind of like salaries

1202
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,160
I won't tell you what anybody in my

1203
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,200
company makes not because I think salary

1204
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,400
should be secret as a matter of fact

1205
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,900
salary is being secret has caused

1206
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,099
problems for years

1207
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:33,859
here's why I don't tell people salaries

1208
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:37,079
Kathy's salary is her business and if I

1209
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:38,579
share it without knowing that she's okay

1210
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,339
with it I'm an [ __ ]

1211
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:42,420
it's the same thing with pen test

1212
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,280
reports I'm not going to share that pen

1213
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,079
test report but if you work with a

1214
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,880
company and you talk to another pen Test

1215
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,800
Company any company that's called Black

1216
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,060
Hills they'll give you a copy of a

1217
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,500
report they've done

1218
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,060
calling Guardians they'll give you a

1219
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,400
copy of a report they've done call ions

1220
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,900
they'll give you a copy trusted sex

1221
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,400
they'll give you a copy red Siege

1222
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,900
they'll give you a copy and what I just

1223
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,180
did is I listed a group of people that I

1224
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,099
have no problem if they beat me on a bid

1225
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:07,859
a trade is they'll give you a copy

1226
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,900
there's good pen test reports you can do

1227
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,540
there's a GitHub repo

1228
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,460
where they have been collecting but the

1229
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,960
problem is they're collecting ones that

1230
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,400
are put on websites and they're very

1231
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,839
often redacted

1232
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,940
okay but every one of those companies I

1233
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,380
just told you will give you a pen test

1234
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,900
report and they are good ones

1235
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,839
okay does that help okay next question

1236
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,500
yes sir

1237
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:38,180
I didn't tell the story

1238
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,020
have you ever worked with check marks

1239
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,880
talk recently went through

1240
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,040
um

1241
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,560
and you don't understand how I hate them

1242
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,400
they lied

1243
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,920
I asked them I had a job I was a

1244
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,720
customer I asked them specifically if

1245
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,160
they were able to support something I

1246
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,140
was told by their engineering team that

1247
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,000
they could and what they meant they

1248
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,680
could in a version that wasn't released

1249
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,260
to the public and they screwed me

1250
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,780
and I told them that I was going to let

1251
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,579
everybody know they screwed me and then

1252
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:15,960
I would make sure that in every talk I

1253
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,240
give I say don't buy check marks and

1254
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,160
I've kept that promise because unlike

1255
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,078
them I keep my promises

1256
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,690
my lawyer hates that I say that

1257
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,040
[Music]

1258
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,920
I pay her to help

1259
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,010
so any other questions

1260
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,240
[Music]

1261
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,220
I mean I agree with them you're saying a

1262
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,420
lot of things you're saying we were

1263
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,359
doing 15 years ago

1264
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,940
you know you're validating doing you

1265
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,560
know making sure you're getting a good

1266
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,200
report this doesn't seem all that new I

1267
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,540
guess it's not here's the problem

1268
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,020
when you say we were doing that 15 years

1269
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,980
ago

1270
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,200
you were in a very select group because

1271
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,760
15 years ago when I was working in

1272
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,380
Guardians you're absolutely right we did

1273
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,420
everything I said up there 15 years

1274
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,920
later when I'm at secure ideas we're

1275
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,420
doing everything I say up there the good

1276
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,260
stuff the problem is the wheeze that do

1277
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,660
that are the rare ones

1278
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,240
right when you go to the pen test puppy

1279
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,280
mills and we all know who they are right

1280
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,740
you all know that when you bid on a pen

1281
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,319
test an optiv wins it instead of you or

1282
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,880
let's okay let's go with a really good

1283
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,260
one because some of the opt-in stuff is

1284
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,099
good

1285
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,740
anything that comes out of coal fire

1286
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,140
right oh yeah see I heard groans because

1287
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,660
you all know it but we're not willing to

1288
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,220
say it out okay I'm willing to say it

1289
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,319
out loud

1290
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,780
we don't say it right it's kind of like

1291
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,980
and this is going to be so inappropriate

1292
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,180
but I'm gonna say it because I'm an

1293
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,740
inappropriate person it's in court

1294
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,240
records I'm an [ __ ] and it wasn't

1295
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,680
Divorce Court where I assume that

1296
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,279
happens a lot

1297
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,099
for years at Defcon we knew of people

1298
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,839
that sexually assaulted and harassed

1299
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:55,859
people

1300
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,319
and we still put them on pedestals we as

1301
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:02,119
an industry take the scum of the earth

1302
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:04,800
and treat them like they're [ __ ] rock

1303
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,540
stars

1304
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,040
how many times have you seen Kevin

1305
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,160
mitnick on stage as a keynote being paid

1306
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,900
thirty thousand dollars to give that

1307
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,060
keynote address and he stands up and

1308
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,160
says I committed crimes that shouldn't

1309
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,260
have been crimes and I would do it again

1310
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,460
I have no problem with people who've

1311
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,380
done felonies I don't

1312
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,119
you get arrested you made a mistake you

1313
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:25,740
did something bad you served your time

1314
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,180
and you know what [ __ ] I'm gonna

1315
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,740
help you out

1316
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,480
but when you finish it and you say what

1317
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,640
I did wasn't bad and I shouldn't have

1318
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,200
been held to that standard when it was

1319
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,300
bad don't get me wrong

1320
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,280
then that's a problem why are we putting

1321
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,599
him on a pedestal

1322
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,579
and I'm not asking you to put me on the

1323
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:44,220
pedestal he's on I'm asking you to put

1324
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,059
the good people on the pedestals we

1325
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,460
stand on the shoulders of giants I am

1326
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,200
where I am because of the other people

1327
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,619
who held me up and my job my role is to

1328
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,359
hold up the next people and the problem

1329
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,859
is there's way too many people who don't

1330
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:00,660
want to be held up

1331
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,040
there's way too many people who don't

1332
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,339
want to support the weight of others we

1333
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:06,839
aren't competitors

1334
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,000
we should share all this information and

1335
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,099
we don't so you're right nothing I said

1336
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:13,680
is new the problem is we haven't kept

1337
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,059
doing it

1338
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:18,059
you know it sucks by the way I'm going

1339
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,140
to tell this story because I think it's

1340
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,119
hilarious a lot of people think I look

1341
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,579
like Kevin midnight

1342
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:25,740
and over the years I have been asked

1343
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,479
many times to sign his book

1344
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,640
every time I'm asked to sign his book I

1345
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,319
sign it

1346
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,839
but I signed it as Kevin Johnson because

1347
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,700
I'm not going to defraud the person hey

1348
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,260
you asked me to decide I don't know why

1349
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,700
you want me to sign that book when I'm

1350
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,140
signing it so I actually have an eBay

1351
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,880

1352
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,260

1353
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,059

1354
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,460

1356
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,339

1357
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:58,380
help did it because you're right it's

1358
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,480
