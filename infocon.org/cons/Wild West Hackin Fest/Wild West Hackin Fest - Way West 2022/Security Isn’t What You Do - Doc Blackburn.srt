7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,400

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,880
to have this many of you in this room

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,640
um there's too many people i don't know

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,000
how many of you are now all of a sudden

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,840
claustrophobic

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,000
after the past few years i've got that

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,560
feeling a little bit a couple of quick

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,400

the way west wild west hack fest

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,280

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
the hell out of me i don't know if

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,440

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,640
someone wearing this shirt there's

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,399
someone that can help you

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,239
uh if you have a question you want to

26
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,079
get to the right place if you have

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,559
medical assistance that's needed please

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,079
look out for somebody wearing one of

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,000
these shirts and they can help you out

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,960
also

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
it's ridiculous how many people have

32
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,800
these shirts right now our staff

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,239

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,840
set up has just been amazing can i get a

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,280
round of applause for everybody that's

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,320
been setting all of this up

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,840
so and if you see something suspicious

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
something weird just let us know um

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,080
there's no reason to go in and confront

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
people and turn it into a scene but let

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,720
us

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
talk to the people who can actually

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,320
handle that i would appreciate that i'm

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,520
also going to talk a little bit about

45
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,960
code of conduct if you go and look on

46
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,280
our website we do have a code of conduct

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,880
the first year that we did this my code

48
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,840
of conduct was don't be a jerk

49
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,759
and if you don't know what being a jerk

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
is if you're coming up to me or like i

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,520
want specific details on what qualifies

52
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,960
being a jerk

53
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
don't come

54
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,200
um if you're that

55
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,960
confused over what being an is

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,640
you shouldn't be here you shouldn't be

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
around people

58
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,240
all right she said jerk now you're

59
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
 yeah we're escalating we're

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,200
escalating we're escalating um but

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
here's the deal we can disagree with

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,520
each other folks

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,199
we don't have to make it a personal

64
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,720
argument we don't have to escalate it to

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
the point where we hate each other we

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
can have disagreements

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,599
you know about should there be four

68
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,480
layers the stevens model or are there

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
seven layers in the osi model taste

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,680
grace less filling all of that

71
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,959
um also if someone isn't interested take

72
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,400
the

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,760
leave them alone

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,879
right okay this isn't this isn't okay

75
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,200

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,160

77
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,519

78
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,640

80
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,680

82
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,080
let you know um if there is a conflict

83
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,920
between people at this conference i'm

84
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,040
going to ask both people to leave

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,440
and i'm not doing that because i'm being

86
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,080
an a-hole or just you know

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760

between two individuals i am not going

89

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
rest of the people at the conference

95

lot of really cool workshops uh going on

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,640
another mother jonathan ham um is not

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
feeling well and he made the right

121
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,280
decision somebody applauded

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,199
that guy is sick

123
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
or they applaud it too soon they're like

124
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,959
i should have heard the rest of that and

125
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,960
he made the smart decision

126
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
he didn't feel good

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
and he is not

128
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,600
to be presenting

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
i'm gonna say this if you're not feeling

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,560
well

131
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
be like jonathan

132
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,199
you know don't come downstairs and cough

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,280
all over us no we don't we don't need

134
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
that so he unfortunately will not be

135
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,199
here if you can send him well wishes on

136
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,280
twitter i'm sure he won't read them uh

137
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,960
because he's he's smart and he stays off

138
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
of twitter

139
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,440
um

140
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,840
nathan sweeney will be presenting 2 p.m

141
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,199
to 2 50.

142
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,720
i believe that nathan's taking over

143
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
jonathan's slot is that correct

144
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
um and he's got this talk which i have

145
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
to see

146
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
shortcuts through the minds of mariah

147
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,800
how bad could it be

148
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
i'm guessing bad

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,320

165
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600

he was a dean okay so he was literally

167
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,800
freaking college uh

168
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,680
and

169
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
my one of my favorites that i've ever

170
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,919
keep the audio

171
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,919
air every time i touch it

172
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,840
on your left

173
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
so

174
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
i'm gonna hold this up

175
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,600
we're gonna keep this going um

176
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,560
we were playing around a while ago

177
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720
and we were talking about the dmca we

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
were talking about music and how they if

179
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,039
you're sharing music

180
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
you could get like the record companies

181
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
to come after you we devised a scheme so

182
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,680
what ray did is he burnt all of his

183
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
music onto a hard drive for me and he

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
gave it to me as his backup service

185
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,560
and periodically i had to validate the

186
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
backups and we thought that that would

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,639
be a good way of getting around um

188
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,479
the riaa and everything that they were

189
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,280
doing with music so uh but ray is one of

190
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,600
the legitimate completely legitimate we

191
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
were hoping we would get sued i don't if

192
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
you self report on youtube there are no

193
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,599
penalties if you sell report on youtube

194
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,919
so hi youtube welcome this conference

195
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,639

196

197
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,280
of the tracks and then bb king is going

198

security isn't what you do i'm going to

215

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,839
45. you know how you know how budgets

299
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,680
are if you don't use the whole budget

300
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,279
they take it away from you and so now

301
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,560
they're like oh well you can do it in

302

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,360
velda but we're going to have a very

305
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,279
very uncomfortable conversation here

306
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,279
and the conversation

307
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,959
is going to be around

308
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,560
one question

309
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,680
and one question only

310
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,240
are we secure

311
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,800
so let's start with a thought exercise

312
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
on that

313
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
when i give presentations

315
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,240
presentations before

patricia

335
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720

340
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800

well he learned because he talked to

344
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
patricia she's walking out the door it's

345
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,639
like yes we are secure

346
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,839
now

347
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,519
i i as the boss i got the answer i was

348
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,760
looking for right obviously because when

349
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
patricia said no

350
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,279
i fired her

351
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,720
so now

352
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,040
and i forgot your name already

353
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,320
daniel

354
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,040
daniel said yes we are secure now what

355
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,639
did i as the boss hear not

356
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,519
not what did daniel say

357
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,279
but what did i hear as the boss

358
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,360
that where what so go ahead you're safe

359
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,360
we're safe which means no

360
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,440
no hacks no breach right

361
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,240
daniel i remembered your name this time

362
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,399
two times the charm

363
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,240
is that what you meant to tell me can

364
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,000
you tell me

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
can you tell me that we'll never be

366
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
breached

367
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
no of course no of course not

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,519
then why did you say that we're secure

369
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,040
so now what happens what's that

370
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
that's what that's what the boss wants

371
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,519
to hear but then what happens

372
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,200
is daniel

373
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,800
is the first one out the door he gets

374
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,560
unceremoniously fired

375
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,440
when we get breached

376
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,959
and then i hi uh who with the

377
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,880

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,480
of my brother's names all right so craig

382
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,639
daniel just got fired and now i ask you

383
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,839
i hire you and i ask you are we secure

384
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,839
he's got a deer in the headlights look

385
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,160
camera on him here you should see his

386
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,279
face here it's like wow

387
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,959
are we secure

388
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,440
i don't know i don't know who that's a

389
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,720
great answer

390
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,399
no you just you're not you're just

391
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,720
parroting what patricia said you want to

392
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,480
get fired don't you yeah

393
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,680
yes is the wrong answer

394
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,959
because we can't guarantee it right

395
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:29,760
no

396
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,920
is the wrong answer because the boss

397
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
doesn't want to hear that

398
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,399
and you

399
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,079
you call yourself security

400
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,560
now when i say that some of you right

401
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,320
now you're thinking well you don't

402
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,480
understand though there's so much more

403
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
to it just saying it's like but there's

404
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,199
but

405
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,199
yeah i know some of you are feeling that

406
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,680
way right now it's uncomfortable right

407
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,639
well some others of you

408
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,440
are probably like preach it brother

409
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,040
you are giving us the word this is the

410
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
word this is what i'm talking about well

411
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
just wait folks those that

412
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,199
yeah

413
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,760
you don't know what the answer is do you

414
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,600
if any of you know it blurt it out

415
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,920
please because i haven't figured it out

416
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
yet all right

417
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,440
not yet

418
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,639
now

419
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
i'm sure some of you say well wait a

420
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,839
minute doc

421
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,759
so you're either in one camp or you're

422
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,560
in the other or all of you others are

423
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,800
like wow doc blackburn's already blown

424
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,120
through three memes on the first slide

425
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,639
of its presentation

426
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,160
it's like yeah

427
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,240
you know why not

428
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,839
pictures are easy to find on the

429
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,440
internet use google right and my brother

430
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,399
the reason that i put this picture up

431
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,680
is my brother the other day and all the

432
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,079
stories i'm gonna tell are true

433
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,680
my brother i had a conversation with him

434
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,759
about a month ago and he said he said

435
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,279
you know you're like sheldon cooper

436
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,759
and i asked him i said

437
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,360
what's a sheldon cooper and apparently

438
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,639
apparently my asking that question made

439
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,959
me more of a sheldon cooper

440
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,240
i don't know

441
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,279
i just found pictures i saw some lady

442
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,519
yelling and some other person with hands

443
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,680
in the air you know and oh by the way

444
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,440
since we're dealing with all of these

445
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,519
memes i know

446
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,800
today is a special special day right

447
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,360
it's the it's the anniversary of

448
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,880
battlestar galactica right

449
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
and so all i'm going to say is

450
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,680
yeah okay

451
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,000
all right let's go let's back to the

452
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,639
question here so are we secure we know

453
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,120
that no isn't the right answer yes isn't

454
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,560
the right answer

455
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
and so we deflect we

456
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
let's say let's say

457
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,279
you pull

458
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,000
an answer out of your butt

459
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,720
that gets you out of the boss's office

460
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,959
and now you're back in the hallway

461
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,559
slowly

462
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,760
glad i

463
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,919
got through that

464
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,359
well now here's the thing you're no

465
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,319
longer relevant in your organization

466
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,919
if you aren't going to be able to answer

467
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,319
this question to the boss so

468
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,079
my question to you is

469
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,000
is it

470
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,400
really the right question to ask

471
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,520
can any of you say

472
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,760
that you will never be sick again in

473
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,400
your life can anybody say that we take

474
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
vitamins apparently we're doing yoga

475
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,919
tomorrow which sounds like a lot of fun

476
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,000
we're going to do some running

477
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
we take care of our bodies

478
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
but nobody here can say you will never

479
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,520
ever again be sick can anybody say that

480
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,000
just checking just making sure everybody

481
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,160
you say you'll never be sick again yeah

482
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,400
liar

483
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,120
no

484
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,200
no we can't say that right one out of

485
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,160
what 200 or 150 and we can't be wrong

486
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,200
right

487
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
so

488
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,320
what's the problem that we're dealing

489
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,880
with here

490
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
the problem is

491
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
is when the boss asked you the question

492
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,200
it was their expectation

493
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,280
as to what the answer would be it was a

494
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,640
matter of breach or no breach

495
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
and that's the metric right

496
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,039
yes i'm seeing some faces they're like

497
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
it is

498
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,559
the boss thinks that this is the metric

499
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,280
for you doing your job right

500
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,640
now

501
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,200
what that does is it puts us in a very

502
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
uncomfortable position

503
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,480
because

504
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
we

505
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,760
are based on this metric

506
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,679
we are being paid

507
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,760
so nothing bad happens to the

508
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,600
organization doesn't that feel like a

509
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,080
mob boss sort of proposal right there

510
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
it'd be a shame if something happened to

511
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,240
your stuff

512
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,039
they're paying us so nothing bad happens

513
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,600
to our organization is that the right

514
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,960
way

515
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,400
to have our jobs be viewed

516
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,559
because that's how the boss sees us

517
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,640
right now unless we change the

518
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,280
expectation now some of you may say well

519
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,880
blah blah blah you know we do the we do

520
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,039
what the company across the street is

521
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,799
doing

522
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,799
right you ever you ever run across a new

523
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,840
problem

524
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,480
and you ask i have literally been in a

525
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,240
position where i've had a boss ask me

526
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,520
as i was working for a research hospital

527
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,039
we had of affiliate hospitals

528
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,880
and my boss who was

529
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
had the title of director of security

530
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,919
said

531
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,520
well what are they doing across the

532
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,760
street what's children's hospital doing

533
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,640
as if children's hospital had any idea

534
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
what the they were doing

535
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,400
sorry

536
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,280
right

537
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,159
come on

538
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,080
now now we're preaching it

539
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,520
yeah we're gonna do what they're doing

540
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,039
as if they had some sort of a plan in

541
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,240
place

542
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,480
somebody over there was like i don't

543
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,679
know

544
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,400
put a firewall in front of it right the

545
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,480
firewalls are magic they make us secure

546
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,720
so

547
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,120
let's take things a step further now

548
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,000
security

549
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
is getting in the way

550
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,120
of the business

551
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,880
the business does not exist

552
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,440
to secure it

553
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,159
i don't care whether or not you have

554
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,039
security in your job title

555
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,960
the business doesn't exist for us to

556
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,080
secure it

557
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
the network

558
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,760
doesn't exist for us to make sure nobody

559
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
ever gets in i actually i have i have a

560
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,360
friend who

561
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,799
one day he he um uh he calls me up he's

562
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
like hey he knew knew what he did for a

563
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,320
living

564
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,720
and he said hey so doc you know you're

565
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,640
students you teach them all the stuff

566
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,679
and what we want what i've got here is i

567
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,760
created this network

568
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,360
and it just has

569
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,320
for fun and and i want to see

570
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,840
if somebody could break into it do you

571
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,000
want you want to give that

572
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,679
network address to your students and see

573
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,520
if they can break in

574
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
and i said sure

575
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,080
and i asked them

576
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,720
what does the network do

577
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,200
what do you mean

578
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
i said what does the network do what did

579
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,039
you make it for

580
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,200
he said well no i just was putting it

581
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,320
together it just it does nothing i said

582
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,120
congratulations you made something that

583
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,640
doesn't exist it's not real

584
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,280
because all of our networks are designed

585
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,000
to do some sort of a job and when we put

586
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,480
security in place

587
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,720
that causes that network to no longer do

588
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,520
the thing that it's supposed to do

589
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,240
we're wrong right all of a sudden we're

590
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,520
wrong

591
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,320
for

592
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,200
not allowing them to do this thing now

593
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
this particular picture i know it's a

594
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,960
very it's a very thought-provoking

595
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
picture right a friend of mine was

596
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,799
skiing in chile and

597
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,400
and he took a picture of that and he

598
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,080
sent it to me he's like doc that i think

599
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,559
that sums up he's a security guy as well

600
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,720
so that sums up our our job right there

601
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,840
i said yeah pretty much that's that's it

602
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,919
totally now it the problem is even worse

603
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,440
than that

604
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,919
because

605
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,000
we

606
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
they want us to secure the network

607
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,080
but we don't get to spend all of the

608
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,039
money to secure the network right

609
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,640
right because every dollar

610
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,240
you spend

611
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,320
on security reduces the value of that

612
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,360
asset by one dollar is my microphone

613
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,600
cutting in oh it sounds like it is yeah

614
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
stay away from metal stay away from mel

615
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,559
stay away from metal i i feel like uh

616
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,600
howard

617
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,400
howard and better call saul or oh chuck

618
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,200
chuck that's it's chocolate

619
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
everything everything else

620
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,840
all right

621
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,360
it's working it's working now maybe

622
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,240
maybe

623
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,720
they're just penning me in maybe i just

624
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
have to stay here but they can't go too

625
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,240
far back they said i get feedback if i

626
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,600
go back here

627
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,840
which is hilarious which means i don't

628
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,919
get to see my own slides you know i'm

629
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,640
flying blind over here i i when when you

630
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,039
see the slide i see it too

631
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,640
for the first time

632
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,520
now

633
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,559
my

634
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,159
mommy

635
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,760
remember all these stories are true my

636
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,760
mommy gives me a crisp 100 bill

i got my 100 dollar bill awesome

639
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,400
some years i spend it on

640
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,120
material things one year i bought a base

641
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,360
used and i actually i was flying from

642
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
denver to chicago

643
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,240
and i'm holding that base in its case

644
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,240
and walking down the the road in um um

645
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,600
on the plane

646
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,640
and this guy with this purple hair goes

647
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480
oh you can just throw yours on top of

648
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,679
mine there

649

and and uh

652
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,840

657
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,679
if i'm allowed to do that but i sat next

658
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,720
to him

659
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,400
and we're silent for a few seconds i

660
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,480

661
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,039

for your daily health you don't have any

669
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,039
idea the things that i just said

670
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,039
he was important at one point he signed

671
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,760
my base when he got to chicago midway he

672
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,840
signed my base for me so it made it

673
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,480
special that was a special 100

674
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,159
but this last christmas

675
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,480
i decided you know what i want to

676
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,559
the crisp 100 bill that my mommy gives

677
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,440
me

678
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
has special meaning too

679
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,960
because my mom gave it to me

680
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,720
so i decided i'm going to protect this

681
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
i'm not going to spend it it's an

682
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,200
heirloom i'm going to keep that

683
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,159
so

684
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,720
i need a special place to keep it

685
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,039
i go down to target yeah i know they got

686
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,520
breached i still shop there i go down to

687
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,960
target and

688
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
what was nice is he started seeing those

689
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,720
people in your class

690
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,440
you the the what i like seeing

691
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,679
is breach happens i don't like seeing

692
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,919
breach happened all right i mean i do

693
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,559
it's called job security but i i don't

694
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,799
like seeing breaches happen but when the

695
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,159
breach happens what i do like to see is

696
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,200
students showing up in my classroom uh

697
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
for those companies like at least at

698
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,039
least they're turning things around at

699
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,039
least they're starting to do the right

700
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,480
things now

701
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,120
but i go to target and i look on the

702
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,919
shelf it's like hmm there's there's this

703
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,240
safe a fireproof safe and that's a small

704
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,880
one it's like that's perfect i could put

705
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,640
my 100 bill in this safe and and some

706
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
other things as well some important

707
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,880
papers and so i said this is perfect i

708
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
take it to the register put it on the

709
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,840
belt the cashier rings it up and says

710
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,840
100 please i said yes and i give

711
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,960
them

712
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,559
oh

713
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,240
the 100

714
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,840
that i was going to protect in the safe

715
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,600
folks we don't get to spend all of the

716
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
money protecting the assets because the

717
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,320
asset would be worth zero at that point

718
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,480
i can't spend one hundred dollars

719
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,720
protecting one hundred dollars

720
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,600
because

721
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
then it's worth nothing

722
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,440
it's worth nothing at all

723
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,919
so we don't get to spend all of the

724
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,240
money

725
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,520
also speaking of money

726
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,880
insecurity

727
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,320
we're seen

728
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,039
as a cost center

729
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,960
what does that mean we're seen as a cost

730
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,760
center it's going back to a few slides

731
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,880
here we pay the money so i mean

732
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,320
we pay security money so nothing bad

733
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,039
happens to our stuff

734
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,440
and even worse than that

735
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
we also get labeled as the department of

736
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,440
no

737
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,919
whatever you do do not ask security

738
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,640
because they'll tell you no right

739
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
so what do they do they take the manager

740
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,799
takes their purchasing card and just

741
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,279
here just just buy it just buy it

742
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,320
don't tell security about

743
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,039
which is about the worst possible

744
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,200
condition we could be in

745
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,279
at that research institute that was

746
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,559
working for we had a we had a new

747
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,960
researcher come in um

748
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,880
i'll leave names out of this but let's

749
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,799
just say this particular principal

750
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,200
investigator we poached them from johns

751
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,919
hopkins university it's like yes you've

752
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,640
got a big gun here millions of dollars

753
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,480
of funding

754
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,440
and i at the time i was supporting uh

755
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,840
that area of the the research

756
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,960
institution and and she comes to me one

757
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,440
day she says so doc you're you're you're

758
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,279
the person that helps me with my i.t

759
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,960
stuff right and i said yeah sure what do

760
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,120
you need and she said here let me show

761
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,960
you and we go to her office to her her

762
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,880
wet lab and for those that know and

763
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,960
research a wet lab that's a heck of a

764
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,039
lot more important than dry lab the

765
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,200
difference between the two is a wet lab

766
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,679
is a lab that has a sink yes

767
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,360
that's what the researchers want is a

768
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,080
lab with a sink and yes that's as an

769
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,799
actual thing and she had a bunch of it

770
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,960
it was actually her wet lab area was

771
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
about the size of this room

772
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,399
and when it comes to research dollars

773
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,000
that's huge

774
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,320
and she took me over to one of the

775
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,360
cabinets and she opens it up and there's

776
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,679
servers and blinking lights and cables

777
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,919
and switches and and all sorts of stuff

778
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,159
and she's like i need to

779
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,760
and i didn't let her finish her

780
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,520
statement i i closed it

781
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,520
and i said

782
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,600
i was never here

783
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,360
and i walked right out the door

784
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,399
that's shadow i.t right where they bring

785
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,919
in the i.t yet if something was to

786
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,399
happen to that

787
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,360
the university would be in trouble

788
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,399
it wouldn't be so and so researcher you

789
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,200
know had stuff in a cabinet that they

790
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,600
didn't tell anybody about this stuff and

791
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,320
so you know that's not the headline it

792
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,360
was the university had a breach

793
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,919
and so here we are dealing with this

794
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,320
this uh these things that we don't even

795
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,080
know about

796
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,840
because either it's allowed it's like

797
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,760
why was that allowed she brought

798
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,919
millions of dollars of research funding

799
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,799
in so of course it was allowed

800
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,320
she was making the business better

801
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,279
remember we support the business

802
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,279
so those are the types of things that

803
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,679
we're dealing with everybody to get in

804
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,200
the picture here we we've got a problem

805
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,600
keith palmgren

806
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,240
summed it up best

807
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,360
when he said that when security gets in

808
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,720
the way of the mission security is wrong

809
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,200
not the mission

810
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,320
we cannot do anything

811
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,559
that gets in the way of what we're doing

812
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,360
in our

813
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,120
the business

814
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,279
in their job now

815
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,519
keith being a good friend of mine he he

816
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,880
he also let me know that he said once

817
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,559
he said now doc i'm not saying

818
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,159
that i'm batman

819
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,679
he says but you've never seen both of us

820
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,159
in the same room have you

821
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,000
and so of course then i screenshotted

822
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,080
him and i put him in a batman costume

823
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,559
hearings and now his son apparently his

824
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,440
adult son is a huge man a batman fan and

825
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,559
so uh

826
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,840
this is apparently uh his adult son's uh

827
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,480
uh wallpaper on his cell phone now i was

828
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,559
like that's kind of cool but the point

829
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,919
is

830
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,799
that we cannot do things that don't

831
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,279
support the mission we cannot do things

832
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,360
that get in the way of the mission we're

833
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,959
wrong in those cases

834
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,080
so

835
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,919
let's circle back to the original

836
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,200
question of are we secure

837
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,240
now we got hired to do a job we got

838
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,840
hired so the organization wouldn't

839
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,080
become breached right

840
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,159
and now we know

841
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,080
we've discussed this we have lots of

842
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,440
reasons why

843
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,640
we cannot be secure we know that which

844
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,399
means that eventually

845
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,120
you will get pwned you're gonna get

846
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,760
breached it's just a matter of time

847
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,399
we don't get to spend all the money

848
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,279
we don't get to

849
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,360
take this network offline

850
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,080
it's easy to secure systems right um you

851
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,880
just

852
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,960
turn them off and bury them in concrete

853
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,919
it was a um

854
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,679
they say you know if you bury the

855
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,760
computer and concrete in the lead case

856
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,600
thing and is off and all of that it's

857
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,440
probably secure but even then we're not

858
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,600
so sure yeah but then it's unusable

859
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,919
and so we don't get to do that so

860
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,320
eventually you're going to get breached

861
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,720
it's going to happen

862
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,960
does anybody want to argue that point

863
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,559
with me at this

864
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,720
point everybody good

865
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,360
yeah i've i've beat you into submission

866
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,440
that well excellent

867
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,360
nice

868
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,840
yeah which means

869
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,720
eventually we get breached

870
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,519
now

871
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,840
let's say it doesn't happen this year

872
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,679
congratulations

873
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,440
you did your job you we didn't get

874
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,039
breached right does that mean we did our

875
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,039
job this year

876
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,360
this means our number wasn't up at that

877
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,039
time right

878
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,559
so

879
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,720
what happens when we don't get breached

880
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
everything's good we we get raises we

881
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,159
get bonuses

882
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,720
oh no we must have spent too much money

883
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,840
on security which is just it is a

884
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,279
neurotic a neurotic way of looking at

885
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,799
things

886
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,399
we paid you

887
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,720
to make sure that we don't get breached

888
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,440
so when we don't get breached i must

889
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,679
have paid you too much money to do that

890
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,240
so they cut our budget right

891
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,399
because we're known as a cost center oh

892
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,000
well here's a place that we can cut

893
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,039
money

894
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,440
because security is excessive

895
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,000
until it's not

896
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,159
so let's cut their budget

897
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,079
and then let's say congratulations you

898
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,239
just went through another year and you

899
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,760
didn't get breached

900
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,918
what do they do to cut your budget again

901
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,159
and then another year until finally bam

902
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,960
now we're breached all right

903
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,520
and then they unceremoniously fire our

904
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,040
butts

905
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,399
and then the

906
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,040
the cruelest cruelest joke of them all

907
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,239
is they hire new people

908
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,239
to come in to do the same job that we

909
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,399
were doing and what do they do with

910
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,520
those new people they give them money

911
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,000
they give them resources they give them

912
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,639
anything that they need we see it all of

913
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,560
the time we were talking about target a

914
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,879
little bit ago yeah target is a prime

915
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,880
exam now i am not picking on target

916
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,680
specifically just insert company name

917
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,200
here

918
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,960
but a company gets free she's like oh

919
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,880
well we should do better and so they

920
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,200
hire people they bring in resources they

921
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,119
do lots of different things and guess

922
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,200
what

923
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,119
don't feel too bad for yourself when

924
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,560
that happens

925
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,400
because guess what's going to happen to

926
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,800
the new shiny face people that come in

927
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,640
is the same thing's going to happen to

928
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,920
them

929
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,000
it's just going to repeat that cycle

930
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,839
over and over again

931
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,400
now

932
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,119
i need to introduce

933
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:33,920
um

934
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,720
a fictional character

935
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,880
this fictional character is evil doc oh

936
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,320
he's scared

937
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,040
i'm sorry i put this picture up i didn't

938
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,800
give anybody trigger warnings or

939
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,480
anything so let's censor that there we

940
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,599
go

941
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,200
now

942
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,040
evil doctor is a fictional character

943
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
because there's law enforcement law

944
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,800
enforcement in the room all right so i'm

945
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,359
evil doc you know does lots of things

946
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,160
he's a fictional character good doc me

947
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
i wouldn't admit to any of those things

948
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,640
but let's talk about

949
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,720
good versus evil

950
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,680
here

951
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,440
now

952
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,000
what is the job of good

953
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,839
we we come in to work 9 a.m monday

954
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,040
morning we spend eight hours do having

955
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,160
meetings writing reports you know

956
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,599
checking on the logs the firewall rules

957
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,480
well whatever whatever your job is fill

958
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,640
in the blank there

959
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,359
and so you're going about your day

960
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,960
and then you go home

961
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,920
you get you get sick you have to go home

962
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,079
you take vacations

963
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,400
at 5 00 pm you call a day we have to

964
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,960
sleep at some point

965
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,760
does evil ever sleep

966
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,040
does evil stop well some evil might so

967
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,400
like yeah well

968
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
some evil will sleep and then other evil

969
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,079
takes

970
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,400
takes over in their place yeah then some

971
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,200
we have to protect our networks 24 7.

972
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,640
but it's worse than that

973
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,640
i took

974
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,720
a posting

975
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,720
from the uh job site monster.com

976
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,040
and i just i i edited it for brevity for

977
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,119
brevity it's the one on the left by the

978
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,960
way i edited it for brevity

979
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,200
and i put it on the slide and this is

980
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,720
only a little

981
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,400
of what that job posting said for

982
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,599
security administrator

983
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,280
do you see a disconnect

984
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,680
between what we have to do

985
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,839
and what they do

986
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,440
they just they they're going to pull in

987
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,359
our systems and and monetize it right

988
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,040
then they're done

989
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,359
that's it it's not a fair fight in fact

990
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,960
i like to call security our jobs

991
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,400
i like to call it the hockey model

992
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,320
because who's who's my hockey fans here

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,960
i i could barely name five nhl players

1004
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,920
and that's the truth why did i br i just

1005
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,560
set you guys up didn't i

1006
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,320
why did i mention hockey oh here's the

1007
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,839
thing my son

1008
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,839
my son plays hockey

1009
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,280
i'm a fan of my son so therefore

1010
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,359
i watch hockey right

1011
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,320
now when my son was small

1012
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,640
he was he was actually he was a very

1013
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,760
good player a very strong skater

1014
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,720
and i noticed something about what the

1015
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,200
coaches would do with the kids that were

1016
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,599
strong skaters when they were small

1017
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,760
where would they put the strong skaters

1018
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,200
they put them on offense

1019
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,880
for those who

1020
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,359
now i got some i from the corners of the

1021
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,200
room i got some people who were hockey

1022
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,680
fans the rest of you you know how the

1023
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,760
game hockey's played right it's that

1024
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,320
game on the ice and the fishbowl thing

1025
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,560
and they they skate around and all that

1026
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,079
with that so there's sticks and that

1027
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,480
puck thingy and now i've just exhausted

1028
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,400
all the information i know about hockey

1029
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,640
right there

1030
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,800
now they put the best skaters in offense

1031
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,320
why

1032
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,839
because those offensive players as

1033
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,079
strong skaters they could skate past the

1034
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,760
defender

1035
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,839
they only need to be slightly faster

1036
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,000
than the defender and they win

1037
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,520
the whole idea is they get by that

1038
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,760
defense so they can take a shot on net

1039
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,240
without the defender there right i know

1040
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,480
in baseball it's totally this is just

1041
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,119
weird stuff think soccer you know think

1042
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,359
soccer yeah it's kind of like that all

1043
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,640
right

1044
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,520
now

1045
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,160
and yes this this actually the the boy

1046
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,800
in orange and white there with the puck

1047
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
you can see that low puck thingy uh is

1048
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,680
uh

1049
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,319
he's a strong skater

1050
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,240
these kids are i believe they're nine

1051
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,800
and ten years old in this picture and he

1052
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,960
was a strong skater and so he would

1053
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,040
skate past the defender you could see

1054
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,839
his

1055
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,839
the his stick and the puck is just

1056
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,880
inches

1057
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,960
beyond the defensive player but he's won

1058
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,000
already

1059
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,720
because he gets to take the shot now

1060
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,119
but i had noticed i had noticed

1061
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,640
something as he got older as he grew up

1062
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,920
got bigger stronger their level of play

1063
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,800
became more sophisticated

1064
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,480
the coaches did something different

1065
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,599
they took those best skaters

1066
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,440
and they took them off of offense and

1067
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,920
where did they put them

1068
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,560
they put them on

1069
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,000
there's only three different positions

1070
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,319
in hockey right come on just start

1071
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,160
thinking through it here they put him on

1072
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,760
defense

1073
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,079
why

1074
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,319
because in the game of hockey

1075
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,240
the defenseman

1076
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,640
and now you see that these two in the uh

1077
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
toward the top of the slide here they're

1078
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,400
the defending players

1079
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,160
they are

1080
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,680
anticipating

1081
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,480
what the offense does

1082
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,920
they mirror

1083
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,040
the offensive players actions

1084
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,599
and they redirect that offensive player

1085
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,760
away from what the offensive player is

1086
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,280
trying to do

1087
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,440
okay what's the point

1088
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,319
they're doing all of that while

1089
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,119
skating backwards

1090
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,200
it's hard to see in this picture but

1091
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,760
those two uh now this is high school

1092
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,599
hockey right here these kids are about

1093
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,240
uh 16 17 years old 17 18 here um though

1094
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,720
you can't see the action but those those

1095
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,160
two players are actually skating

1096
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,240
backwards while

1097
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,079
mirroring everybody else who's skating

1098
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,560
forwards

1099
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
now

1100
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,599
tv and movies

1101
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,960
have lied to you folks

1102
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,000
yeah i know what

1103
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,079
yes they've lied to you

1104
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,760
because do you know what tv and movies

1105
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,280
have told you for generations

1106
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,640
who's in the net

1107
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,520
the fat kid that can't skate right

1108
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,119
they lied to you do you know who the

1109
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,520
best skater is in the team

1110
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
the goalie themselves does this kid look

1111
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,680
fat does he look slow they're the best

1112
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,000
skaters out there now this has nothing

1113
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,520
to do with the presentation at this

1114
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
point i'm just bragging about my son

1115
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,599
that's my son in net there

1116

12 months ago why thank you thank you

1117
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,440
12 months ago this time i was in st

1118
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,119
louis watching him

1119
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,319
defend

1120
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,480
against the this was in the national

1121
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,960
championships and he was in that

1122
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,280
well thank you

1123
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,440
and not not that i'm proud of him or

1124
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,200
anything right you've got more pictures

1125
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,119
and stuff it was really neat to see him

1126
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,440
play for a national championship but now

1127
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,720
going back to that skating uh i know for

1128
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,640
a fact

1129
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,480
that along with the coaches on the team

1130
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,720
along with the goalie coaches they have

1131
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,960
for the organization

1132
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,839
these players these goalies have their

1133
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,400
own private skating coaches i know i

1134
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,040
write the checks for that

1135
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,440
yeah they're the best skaters out there

1136
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,680
they're the ultimate defender and he

1137
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,599
actually has three other coaches on top

1138
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,440
of that a private coach for positioning

1139
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,119
a private coach for the psychology of

1140
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,960
the game of private coach for game

1141
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,040
situations that's just the stuff that

1142
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,200
they go through but the reason that i

1143
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,680
mention this at all

1144
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,119
is

1145
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,359
insecurity

1146
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,240
that's us we're skating backwards folks

1147
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,560
we're the defense skating backwards

1148
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,599
now

1149
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,760
how are we skating backwards so far

1150
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,599
we've discussed many of these things

1151
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,680
does anybody have

1152
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,680
i got a question for you

1153
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,240
does anybody here have unlimited time

1154
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,200
and resources to fix everything

1155
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,440
in security anybody have unlimited time

1156
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,720
and resources

1157
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,319
darn i always wish that somebody would

1158
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,599
raise their hand because i want a job

1159
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,319
application from you yeah it doesn't

1160
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,760
exist right

1161
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,680
we're constrained by time and money

1162
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,760
also

1163
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,640
we

1164
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,760
have to

1165
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,040
within hockey the offense

1166
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,440
the offense only needs to find one way

1167
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,119
one way to get past the defense right

1168
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,280
what must the defense do to be

1169
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,640
successful

1170
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,599
in stopping the attacker

1171
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,280
they have to

1172
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,800
they have to find and fix all of the

1173
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,920
ways right

1174
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,480
yeah they have to be right every single

1175
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,680
time

1176
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,800
and do the right things

1177
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,640
now

1178
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,640
does an attacker

1179
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,720
need to follow

1180
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,359
your organization's policies in

1181
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,680
attacking you

1182
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,839
no they don't need to do that

1183
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,599
do can we

1184
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,839
can we break policy can you break

1185
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,720
company policy defending your network

1186
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,040
no that's not allowed

1187
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,720
does the attacker

1188
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,400
need to follow your compliance

1189
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,000
regulations

1190
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,680
i don't know

1191
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,480
a single business today i just cannot

1192
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,720
name one that doesn't have some sort of

1193
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,560
compliance regulation that they have to

1194
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,119
follow right does the attacker have to

1195
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,240
follow that

1196
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,160
no

1197
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,720
does the attacker even need to follow

1198
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,400
the law in attacking you oh that's silly

1199
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,160
they've already broken the law they're

1200
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,800
trying to break into our systems can we

1201
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,359
break the law in defending our networks

1202
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,240
no

1203
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,079
you guys get the idea here right and

1204
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,839
there's just some things that just don't

1205
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,640
even have solutions

1206
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,960
people make bad passwords people make

1207
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,160
bad decisions there's shadow i.t and you

1208
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,119
know there's nothing puts the sh in it

1209
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,760
like shadow i.t does right and there's

1210
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,640
there's

1211
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,680
ways around you all are congratulations

1212
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,680
going to be here learning for most of

1213
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,440
the classes most of the tracks you guys

1214
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,800
are doing here you're going to be

1215
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,480
learning how to get around all of the

1216
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,160
defenses right

1217
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,240
so

1218
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,119
we

1219
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,880
cannot

1220
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,040
we cannot

1221
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,680
secure our systems

1222
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,160
and i know that makes many of you angry

1223
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,040
go go back to our original thoughts now

1224
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,880
and start putting all of this together

1225
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,119
so

1226
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,480
what

1227
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,520
are we actually doing

1228
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,200
if security is not our job

1229
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,399
what do we do

1230
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,119
and this is the interactive part just go

1231
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,400
ahead and blurt it out just say it

1232
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,880
we reduce risk okay yeah the the boss

1233
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,640
here's blah blah blah

1234
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,040
we need more money for something right

1235
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,000
we reduce or yes we reduce risk what's

1236
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,040
that

1237
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,000
process it's a pr a process you intrigue

1238
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,280
me

1239
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,400
what process is this

1240
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,880
it's a closed loop kind of process so

1241
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,000
you just

1242
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,680
yeah i had a slide for that yeah

1243
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,920
we learn about attacks and learn ways to

1244
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,559
prevent them and if if you were my

1245
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,000
employee and i was your boss i fell

1246
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,599
asleep halfway through that sentence but

1247
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,000
that's that's a halfway decent answer go

1248
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,160
ahead

1249
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,400
keep the company off the dark web

1250
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,079
what exactly is the dark web wow

1251
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,440
what's that

1252
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,000
where they sell information cool oh i've

1253
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,920

um

1256
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,760
these aren't wrong answers they're not

1257
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,079
bad answers

1258
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,440
we defend

1259
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,559
okay great i i like i like that answer

1272
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,680
affection towards somebody is to pick on

1273
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,880
them so um now i

1274
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,319
no those are all noble answers

1275
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,400
what i'm gonna do is take all of those

1276
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,559
answers that you guys gave

1277
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,240
i'm gonna smush them together and make

1278
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,280
it sound smart okay

1279
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,800
we're managing our levels of insecurity

1280
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,800
that's that is what we're doing isn't it

1281
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,319
that covers all of those answers

1282
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,640
what does that mean

1283
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,520
well

1284
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,839
for one

1285
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,440
our boss doesn't understand our job

1286
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,720
is your job title insecurity manager

1287
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,079
it should be right

1288
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,400
it's a

1289
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,520
security is in our job title go ahead i

1290
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,760
said that builds that bill that builds

1291
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,480
confidence doesn't it i am an insecurity

1292
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,079
manager

1293
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,000
but it is what we do

1294
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,319
right

1295
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,720
let's talk about this for a second what

1296
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,640
does that mean

1297
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,920
well

1298
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,359
first

1299
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,720
we need to

1300
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,599
acknowledge that security

1301
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,800
just isn't our job

1302
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,880
and i think we're all there right now

1303
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,119
right

1304
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,480
but what we need to do

1305
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,040
is acknowledge that i mean internalize

1306
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,079
it

1307
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,480
you're managing your organization's

1308
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,119
insecurities

1309
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,160
but security is in your job title

1310
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,480
we need to change the way

1311
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,640
the organization sees our jobs

1312
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,040
so let's talk about these just a little

1313
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,319
bit here

1314
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,000
first

1315
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,119
we have to take away the expectation

1316
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,800
that our role in the organization is an

1317
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,040
expense

1318
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,520
i can stand in front of a room full of

1319
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,680
executives just like this

1320
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,160
and i can talk about security without

1321
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,480
even saying the word security

1322
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,319
and i can get them all riled up they're

1323
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,960
like yeah that's the stuff

1324
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,400
by saying

1325
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,680
simply

1326
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,680
what we're going to do here is we are

1327
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,319
going to build repeatable processes that

1328
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,000
yield dependable results yeah

1329
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,599
well isn't that security

1330
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,559
isn't that security

1331
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,480
if you can build

1332
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,839
repeatable processes

1333
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,640
and the outcome is dependable

1334
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,640
that to me is the definition of security

1335
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,160
but

1336
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,640
it's an important reframing

1337
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,960
of the conversation

1338
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,960
because what have i just done

1339
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,920
i've aligned myself with the business

1340
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,200
i've aligned myself as a strategic

1341
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,319
partner

1342
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,400
in the business

1343
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,160
by reframing what our job is

1344
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,040
we can also do a better job

1345
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,839
of

1346
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:10,880
of

1347
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,000
defining with our organization how

1348
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,119
we

1349
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,880
spend money

1350
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,480
to protect money

1351
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,720
i am going to spend a little bit of

1352
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,680
money

1353
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,559
to save a lot more money

1354
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,599
i know i know that all of you in this

1355
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,000
room know this

1356
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,720
i'm going to ask you the question

1357
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,319
what have you done

1358
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,960
what have you done in your business

1359
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,400
to explain that to them

1360
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,920
are you giving them the right reports

1361
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,160
on what the activities are that you're

1362
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,920
actually doing

1363
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,599
because the businesses if you're not

1364
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,359
communicating that to them they're just

1365
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,680
seeing it as oh i don't know we pay the

1366
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,000
magic wizard behind the curtain money

1367
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,480
and the the magic wizard pulls the

1368
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,760
levers

1369
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,520
what lovers did they pull

1370
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,960
does anybody here have

1371
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,520
a safe place on the internet where you

1372
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,119
don't get attacked anybody have a

1373
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,800
visible ip address out on the internet

1374
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,760
that doesn't ever get attacked

1375
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,280
are we

1376
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,079
communicating to leadership

1377
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,640
how often we do get attacked

1378
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,720
are we telling them how often it happens

1379
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,480
how many punches we're blocking

1380
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,200
my son as a goalie

1381
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,160
he's got a stat

1382
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,400
for the goalies i was like yes there's

1383
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,960
there's goals against

1384
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,880
okay

1385
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,480
but what other metric are goalies

1386
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,119
measured against not just how many goals

1387
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,000
they let in

1388
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,119
but how many they stopped

1389
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,880
are you

1390
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,000
communicating to the right people

1391
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,520
in your organization in the right way

1392
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,599
to tell them how many shots you've

1393
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,040
stopped

1394
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,200
are you actually doing that

1395
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,119
because guess what the boss thinks

1396
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,839
is going on when you don't give them

1397
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,000
those that information

1398
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,440
they think it's a big fat goose egg

1399
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,079
right i think it is oh well we got we

1400
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,640
got pwned three times yeah we were

1401
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,880
attacked thousands of times

1402
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,240
well

1403
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,920
we need to show them that value we're

1404
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,680
not doing that we're not showing them

1405
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,440
somebody had mentioned decreasing

1406
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,400
liability early on and yes absolutely

1407
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,240
that was one of the punch lines i had

1408
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,760
thank you the checks in the mail whoever

1409
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,400
had said that i forgot who it was yeah

1410
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,640
now

1411
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,480
one of the ways that we can do this is

1412
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,799
randy martini of virginia tech he says

1413
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,760
he's he's been a cisso or whatever his

1414
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,760
job he's got multiple

1415
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,640
roles

1416
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,559
he's been a ciso for a large

1417
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,799
organization for longer than most people

1418
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,759
have held a job

1419
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,240
and he was asked one day i was there

1420
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,599
when he was asked this like randy

1421
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,400
how

1422
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,280
when all of these other cisos are being

1423
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,240
fired after breaches when uh all of

1424
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,920
these people are let go you know even

1425
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,200
the target says the cso for target they

1426
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,240
got canned after the that breach

1427
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,680
randy was asked

1428
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,599
how do you

1429
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,760
continue to do this and stay in your job

1430
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,680
and he said simply

1431
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,480
never waste a breach

1432
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,839
what does that mean never waste a breach

1433
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:40,960
well there's a few different ways of

1434
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,839
looking at this for one

1435
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,359
if your

1436
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,359
organization

1437
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,359
gets compromised microphone went out

1438
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,280
again i was doing all the right things

1439
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,960
they had me trained and all of a sudden

1440
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,599
i lost it

1441
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,920
when your organization gets compromised

1442
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,839
there's hard questions

1443
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,240
that are going to be asked of you and

1444
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,000
what are these answers to these

1445
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,280
questions well that's too late

1446
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,799
one of the things that i did at that

1447
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,799
research university i'm going to go back

1448
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,240
to them

1449
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,319
for this particular example

1450
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,720
is this research since they were dealing

1451
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,440
with uh hipaa data hipaa the health

1452
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,559
information uh health uh uh insurance

1453
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,400
portability and accountability act blah

1454
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,520
blah

1455
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,240
and so every single time because i knew

1456
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,640
that the associate vice chancellor in

1457
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,319
charge of they were our hipaa security

1458
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,400
officer i knew that they were

1459
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,480
checking for all of the hipaa breaches

1460
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,319
you know that every single time one came

1461
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,640
in ocr fined somebody because he wanted

1462
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,240
to stay out of jail you know you know

1463
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,920
you could go to jail by not following

1464
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,640
hipaa heat he decided he didn't want to

1465
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,319
go to jail that was just that thing

1466
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,440
about him you know and so he would watch

1467
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,200
those reports

1468
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,640
so what would i do

1469
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,200
every single one of those reports

1470
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,359
when they came in

1471
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,720
i would read that report i would look at

1472
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,960
what the findings were in that

1473
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,720
corrective action plan these are the

1474
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,960
things that a corrective action plan in

1475
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,280
this particular case is this is the

1476
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,400
you're supposed to be doing that you

1477
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,160
didn't do and therefore we're going to

1478
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,960
find you and so i would look at that and

1479
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,359
i would ask if

1480
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,839
ocr i'm sorry office for civil rights

1481
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,720
yes hipaa data is a civil rights privacy

1482
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,480
issue i would ask

1483
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,839
as us an organization like us

1484
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,839
if ocr came in and didn't audit how

1485
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,559
would we do and so by the time he opened

1486
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,240
up that report

1487
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,880
he knew what the answer would be for us

1488
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,119
that's an example of never wasting a

1489
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,040
breach whatever your industry is i just

1490
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,799
gave you an example for hipaa but

1491
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,280
whether it's let's say you're a large

1492
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,280
retail organization target gets pwns

1493
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,119
what did you guys say anything about

1494
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,920
that other than oh sucks to be target

1495
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,599
did you actually inform your

1496
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,359
organization well you know if that

1497
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,000
happened to us

1498
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,319
that we'd be okay in these areas but you

1499
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,359
know we could we need help over here

1500
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,079
are you doing those things

1501
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,240
and that's all about you know we reduce

1502
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,000
the threat we reduce the vulnerability

1503
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,760
blah blah blah i really don't have much

1504
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,520
to say about that slide what i want to

1505
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,079
do is i want to

1506
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,359
get to

1507
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,920
the crux of the problem

1508
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,920
i have just spent 50 minutes

1509
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,240
framing a problem

1510
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,000
and i am not going to give you an answer

1511
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,040
for it i'm sorry

1512
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,400
but i do have a solution

1513
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,960
don't start plotting yet

1514
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,640
i do have

1515
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,079
a solution first an acknowledgement

1516
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,520
what is the risk appetite of the

1517
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,599
organization do you understand your

1518
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,440
organization's risk appetite is it

1519
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,960
actually written down is it codified in

1520
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,960
policy or is it just the boss thinks

1521
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,240
that we're always going to be secure

1522
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,839
that's a good place to start great

1523
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,040
because there's bruce schneier i'm sure

1524
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,359
most of you know who he is he he says

1525
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,319
there's no point in just thinking that

1526
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,559
this this wave of selflessness is going

1527
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,480
to happen one day where everybody agrees

1528
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,480
on what risk is you need to know

1529
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,839
who the

1530
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,160
people in leadership positions in your

1531
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,119
organization what they think of risk

1532
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,559
and

1533
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,040
you must answer to that

1534
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,319
also

1535
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,720
we need to start speaking in their

1536
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,799
language

1537
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:35,920
now

1538
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,559
here is the solution

1539
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:40,079
that isn't going to fix the problem

1540
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,160
today because

1541
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,440
the problem is not fixable by us that's

1542
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,160
the whole reason why i did not

1543
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,319
give you guys a solution

1544
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,400
this is unsolvable

1545
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,319
by the people in this room

1546
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,640
leadership

1547
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,359
needs to do something

1548
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,680
they don't know that they need to do

1549
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,280
something

1550
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,599
if leadership needs to do something and

1551
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,079
they don't know it

1552
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,880
whose fault is that

1553
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,240
it's it's not leadership's fault

1554
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,040
it's ours because guess what

1555
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,119
when you get compromised i don't know

1556
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,040
who it says i'm gonna address that side

1557
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,160
of the room

1558
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,920
when you get compromised are they gonna

1559
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,760
say my bad and fire themselves

1560
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,960
no

1561
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,040
it's our problem it's our problem to

1562
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,359
solve

1563
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:36,960
so

1564
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,799
what do we do

1565
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,040
first this is the first step

1566
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,200
congratulations for

1567
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,040
being here

1568
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,799
for this last 53 minutes here

1569
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,880
a few minutes i'm gonna stop talking you

1570
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,480
know i'm the quiet one in my family yeah

1571
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,640
i really am this is my outlet i actually

1572
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,200
get to talk uninterrupted you know you

1573
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,439
guys have kids you know right you know

1574
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,280
we have to change the way

1575
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,720
that we view our jobs

1576
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,319
that's step number one

1577
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,160
when we change how we view our jobs

1578
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,720
when we stop calling ourselves security

1579
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,880
and we start acknowledging

1580
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,400
that security isn't our job

1581
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,359
we can start changing our minds about

1582
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,880
how we see our job and then

1583
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,680
when you make that change in how you

1584
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,520
think about your job

1585
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,040
you change

1586
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,960
the way you talk about your job

1587
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,119
and then when you change the way you

1588
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,119
talk about your job

1589
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,359
you will start to this is not something

1590
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,799
that we flip a switch and now we're good

1591
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,599
we're going to change how others

1592
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,920
perceive our jobs

1593
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,559
remember it starts with us

1594
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,400
we change how we think about our job

1595
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,119
which then will change our language

1596
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,160
and then the business starts seeing us

1597
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,440
as a strategic partner

1598
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,680
where we are supporting

1599
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,520
what it is that we're actually doing in

1600
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,920
the business and then only then

1601
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,839
can we be invited to that table

1602
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,720
and actually have a say

1603
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,839
in how our organization is protected

1604
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:36,400
and most importantly

1605
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,319
changing the perceptions of leadership

1606
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,720
that security isn't what we do

1607
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,079
we're managing our levels of insecurity

1608
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,920
but it all starts with us it's up to us

1609
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,079
to change this

1610
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:51,520
leadership isn't going like bruce

1611
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,440
schneier said it just isn't going to

1612
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,200
happen

1613
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,559
we have to change that all right

1614
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,160
now i'm hoping i'm hoping because i've

1615
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,680
over the last

1616
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,039
few years i've gotten to this point

1617
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,200
and it's how i've done my job going

1618
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,359
forward i got tell you it's a wonderful

1619
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:17,119
place to be i sleep well at night

1620
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,079
when i

1621
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,520
reframed how i see my job

1622
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,200
i hope

1623
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,880
that this starts the first step on the

1624
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,440
journey for many of you

1625
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,760
and as an

1626
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,920
that we can change

1627
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,920
our organization's security for the

1628
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,359
better

1629
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,319
so thank you for your time folks i hope
