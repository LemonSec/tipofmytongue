1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,040
my name is Graham Hilton

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,600
um this is going to be like probably the

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,160
least technical talk of this whole

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,240
conference

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,040
there's not anything super you know

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,420
complex

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,820
um like technically but there is some

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,719
interesting

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,760
um well you'll see so this is going to

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,100
be a pretty quick talk uh it's only 15

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,800
minutes but so quick who am I uh my name

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,900
is Brent Hilton I previously did pin

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,439
testing and I currently do research at a

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,840
security company

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,079
I'm a sand student I'm going for my

16
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,660
masters and I'm usually up to no good on

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,640
Twitter and also not on Twitter on my

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,440
website

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,960
to kind of set the stage of this uh has

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,340
anyone here how many people here have

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,079
actually read the abstract of this talk

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,320
before showing up so a few people a few

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,379
people haven't so I'm sorry but this is

24
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,199
going to be probably not what you expect

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,239
um but just to set the stage a little

26
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,920
bit

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,980
around like late 2020 ish early 2021 I

28
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,319
was in John strand's active defense

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,540
class which is a class offered through

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,000
anti-siphon at the time I'm finishing up

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,780
my bachelor's degree and I'm writing a

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,479
Powershell for a company part-time uh

33
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,640
just doing like you know software uh

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,619
making sure things were up to date that

35
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,119
kind of stuff

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,060
so if you haven't taken a anti-siphon

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,560
class before basically the way it works

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,920
is you have uh like 45 minutes of

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,060
um just kind of going through and

40
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,080
learning something and then you have

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,000
like lab afterwards so I'm working on

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,280
this lab and someone in the course

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,340
Discord mentions like hey uh and he tags

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,200
John Strand and he basically says hey

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,500
John how is the other John strand doing

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,420
and so it's at this point that we were

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,119
introduced to our main character of this

48
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,380
presentation and someone who I will

49
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,700
become you know very acquainted with

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,000
over the next year or so so John Tran

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,220
begins talking about this individual who

52
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,500
is also named John strand who happens to

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,040
be a male model right so this of course

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,420
you can't forget his name because it's

55
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,340
written right there

56
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,079
so this male model Don's train

57
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,520
apparently doesn't like cyber security

58
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,280
John's friend because whenever you

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,020
Google John strand the first thing that

60
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,500
comes up is not this model's uh page it

61
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,300
is you know cyber security training uh

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,580
stuff like that so this individual does

63
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,379
not like you know cyber security John

64
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,200
strand very much at all right

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,180
so at this time someone had like sent

66
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,640
the link to you know cyber security John

67
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,040
Tran's book uh offensive countermeasure

68
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,379
is the art of active defense

69
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,000
um so I like have this open on Amazon

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,520
and I had typed in the chat

71
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,620
um you know something along the lines of

72
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,420
oh I want to get male model John

73
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,879
strand's book sign or cyber security and

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,260
John strand's book signed by the male

75
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,459
model like I think that would be really

76
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,980
funny and if the audio is working I have

77
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,319
a clip of that whole interaction so we

78
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,339
will see if the audio is working

79
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,000
does not look like

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,379
it doesn't look like it is but it's fine

81
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,060
basically he says

82
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,620
uh like I think that would be really

83
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,319
hard to do but basically John strand has

84
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,120
the pursuant capture of Kevin mitnick

85
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,860
signed by Kevin mitnick and it's like

86
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,319
one of his favorite possessions right so

87
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,000
you know challenge accepted like it's

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,500
going to be hard to do but maybe I can

89
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,239
like reach out to this John strand guy

90
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,940
uh the mail model and get him to sign

91
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,500
John's book like how hard could that

92
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,260
possibly be so like any like you know

93
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,360
information security professional uh the

94
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,620
first thing I did was I go to Twitter

95
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,420
right because that's where we all live

96
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,340
and so

97
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,319
I figured okay I'd find this model's

98
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,760
Twitter and maybe he's like a really

99
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,280
cool dude and maybe he will like get the

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,360
joke and he'll think it's really really

101
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,159
funny and he will

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,260
uh you know be in on it and he'll be

103
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,459
cool with you know signing this book

104
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,980
right so that's my plan right so it

105
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,140
immediately gets derailed because I go

106
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,940
to his Twitter and his Twitter is now

107
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,980
gone but I go to his Twitter and

108
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,159
originally I had screenshots on here of

109
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,599
this guy's Twitter account but I feel

110
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,680
like I don't need to show you those

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
screenshots to kind of you know give you

112
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,900
an idea of like what you know this guy

113
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,120
his thought process was just like

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,860
imagine like the worst possible like

115
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,540
political takes and the worst possible

116
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,700
like takes off kovid and like all this

117
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,620
fun stuff uh just in like one Twitter

118
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,599
feed like that is his

119
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,459
um his Twitter feed right

120
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,900
and so I was like okay well this is

121
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,339
going to be way harder because this guy

122
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,779
like doesn't seem like a very friendly

123
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,100
dude right

124
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,340
so the next thing I do is I go to Google

125
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,900
and once you get to like the third page

126
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,699
of like the Google search results you

127
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,500
get kind of more like the mail modeling

128
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,020
stuff and less of the cyber security uh

129
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,840
John strand stuff so I go and I click on

130
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,360
johnstrand.com which

131
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,699
I thought would be owned by you know

132
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,100
cyber security John strand right uh no

133
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,419
so I was greeted with a nice

134
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,020
um

135
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,600
a collage of these male models photos

136
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,400
and I've blurred some of these because

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
some of them are like kind of like

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,940
graphic right this is weird it's a

139
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,259
little confusing but it's not like

140
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,660
concerning right except for like that

141
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,919
like I don't know how that necessarily

142
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,919
happens also you can't really see this

143
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,500
it says undefined under it and I'm not

144
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,120
sure if that was like you know you

145
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,620
upload a picture and you don't give it a

146
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,720
name so it just names it for you I'm not

147
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,060
sure if like that was what happened or

148
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,740
they named it undefined like either of

149
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,100
them makes sense right so this is like

150
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,080
confusing but you know whatever like I

151
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,280
don't really care what you do in your

152
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,900
free time like that's cool that he's

153
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,060
really into his modeling

154
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,100
um so I go back to Google I click the

155
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,220
next you know search link and this is

156
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,919
when it goes from confusing

157
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,000
well it goes from confusing to

158
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,220
incredibly concerning right so oh no

159
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,199
part two uh the next Google search

160
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,539
result is an arrest Warren I'm like okay

161
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,820
well like what did he do like maybe he

162
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,979
forgot to pay like a ticket or maybe he

163
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,800
didn't show up to court whatever uh like

164
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,560
not something that's normal but you know

165
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,240
forgivable right

166
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,580
so I'm like reading through this arrest

167
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,880
warrant I'm like oh no like he didn't

168
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,220
like Notch up to court like he showed up

169
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,979
to the Capitol on like January 6 like he

170
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,919
was there like there there

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,840
um and he was like protesting so I'm

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,340
like reading through this document I

173
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,400
used to this Fantastic action shot of

174
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,740
our male model friend like in the

175
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,139
Capitol building on January 6th

176
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,000
um I love this quote individual broke

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,860
into the capital building as paid to

178
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,900
promote propaganda on his website right

179
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,979
so

180
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,440
not like the most friendly individual

181
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
right and this is when most people would

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,020
be like

183
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,759
you know this is weird like this is not

184
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,160
something I want to get into but like at

185
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,360
the time I was writing a lot of

186
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,160
Powershell for this company and the

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,900
number one rule of writing power show is

188
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,340
to spend like the least amount of time

189
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,280
writing Powershell as possible so I had

190
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,960
a lot of time to like think about how I

191
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,300
could like you know get this like scheme

192
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,460
going well scheme's a strong word this

193
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,160
plan in place right

194
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,319
so I come up with this plan right I'm

195
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,880
like sitting there like writing down

196
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,280
notes like okay how can I like get this

197
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
guy to agree to sign this book about

198
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,539
this like written by this dude who he

199
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,280
doesn't really like

200
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,199
so I advise this scheme I like create

201
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,759
like fake accounts and I'm like

202
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,259
following him on Twitter like

203
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,759
interacting with him with like you know

204
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,220
fake Twitter accounts and so I messaged

205
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,280
him on Twitter and my first like DM to

206
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,460
him directly I was like basically hey

207
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,660
mentioned that I have this friend named

208
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,660
John who uh is a huge fan of his

209
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,120
modeling career right and it would be

210
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,099
really cool if at some point like I

211
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:32,039
could like get a male model John strand

212
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,280
to sign a book right

213
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,620
so that was like step one of the plan

214
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,199
right and then he just sends me his

215
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,080
address like on Twitter he just like DMS

216
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,819
me his address it was like sure I was

217
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,740
like what not like his email address

218
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,660
like his physical address like where

219
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,039
he's he lives in like Beverly Hills

220
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,259
right so I was like okay well like that

221
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,419
was a little bit too easy that's a

222
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:55,979
little concerning

223
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,599
um but now I have two concerns right so

224
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,699
I actually need to get him to sign the

225
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,340
book and I need to get the book back to

226
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,319
me right and both of these need to have

227
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,180
like kind of some opsec involved right

228
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,340
like I don't necessarily want him having

229
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,220
like my address and all that fun stuff

230
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,919
so the first steps that I need to do is

231
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,319
I need to figure out how to get him to

232
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,000
actually sign the book when I send it to

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,860
him and I

234
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,259
I figured out that my best chance of

235
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,300
getting him to do this was to kind of

236
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,759
divert his attention away from you know

237
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,220
the security book and maybe find like a

238
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,740
decoy book so that he would be more

239
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,779
interested in that book so I going

240
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,640
through his Twitter post and his arrest

241
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,500
warrant I kind of got a feel for like

242
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,179
what kind of like literature he might

243
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,059
enjoy so I went to Amazon and I

244
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,700
purchased uh this book because I figured

245
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,380
like maybe he had read that right maybe

246
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,019
that sounds like something he'd be into

247
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,820
um so I purchased this I got like a few

248
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,680
concerned texts from like you know my

249
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,540
family whose Amazon I use they're like

250
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,100
what what

251
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,160
um so I purchased this book and at the

252
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,260
time it was it was like twenty dollars

253
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,600
so this 7.99 I'm a little bit jealous of

254
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,240
I guess it wasn't like a great seller uh

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,339
but anyway uh so the next thing I

256
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,740
decided that I needed was sales stickers

257
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,880
you might be like well why do you need

258
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,459
sales stickers if you're not like trying

259
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,560
to scam money out of this guy like I

260
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,060
don't understand why I need sales

261
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,480
stickers so

262
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,720
if you look at John strand's book right

263
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,480
in the middle of the book is his name

264
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,339
so I don't know about you but if someone

265
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,880
sent me a book to sign and I got the

266
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,940
book and I was the author that would be

267
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,200
like a little concerning right that

268
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
might be like a red flag so I decided my

269
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,100
best solution to this you know I thought

270
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,140
about like maybe I could Photoshop it

271
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,060
and like print out like a new cover and

272
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,560
like put a different author or something

273
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,540
but I figured that the best solution to

274
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,339
this would just be to put a big sticker

275
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,200
over John strand's name so he didn't

276
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,839
read who the author was

277
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,480
um and so that's what I did and you know

278
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,279
what happens if he takes it off I don't

279
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,040
know I didn't think that far right so

280
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,839
the next concern is actually getting the

281
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,420
book back to me and kind of like an

282
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,080
opsec Savvy way because he is known to

283
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,180
like show up to houses like Uninvited so

284
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,920
I didn't really want him to like you

285
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,980
know have my address right so you know

286
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,660
at this point like I said I was a

287
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,040
full-time student and I already spent

288
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,940
like 50 on you know stickers and uh

289
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,640
books and all these different things

290
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,180
and so the logical solution would be to

291
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,279
get APO box right

292
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,959
um but I decided that that would be too

293
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,519
much money and too much work so I

294
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,760
basically I called my old apartment and

295
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,019
I said hey

296
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,640
um I have this friend who lives in

297
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,620
California and he's sending me some

298
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,680
books for college but the UPS guy

299
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,660
instead of writing my name Graham Hilton

300
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,540
he wrote Grant Hilton right so like

301
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,399
common you know whatever and my

302
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,560
apartment was like okay yeah like just

303
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,060
tell us whenever like he sends it and

304
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,380
then we'll like let you know whenever we

305
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,940
get it I was like wait I don't need to

306
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,279
like prove that like I am Graham Hilton

307
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,800
and they're like nope bye right so I was

308
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,779
like okay interesting

309
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,680
um

310
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,279
so what I do is I you know package up

311
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,140
these books and I put them in like a

312
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,420
bubble mailer and my last kind of trick

313
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,760
up my sleeve was to put an additional

314
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,260
bubble mailer so we have like a

315
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,660
recursive bubble mailer action going on

316
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,839
here where we have my

317
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,820
my original Bubble Mailer on the outside

318
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,800
with the books and then inside that I

319
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
have an additional one with my old uh

320
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,839
College apartment address and addressed

321
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,500
to Grant Hilton right so not my name

322
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,240
um but and my apartment is supposed to

323
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,160
call me whenever whenever they get this

324
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,100
package right so now the last step is I

325
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,720
need to like drop this off and I just

326
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,640
have to wait for you know my male model

327
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,560
friend to sign these books and send them

328
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,320
back right so now all I have to do is

329
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,519
wait right

330
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,980
so I'm waiting in like four months go by

331
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,720
and at this point I was like this is a

332
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,880
lost cause like no one there's no way

333
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,800
that he's like you know he's like

334
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,360
figured this out right

335
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,120
so I'm like waiting and I'm waiting and

336
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,279
then suddenly I'm like sitting in

337
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,740
traffic in Atlanta on my way home from

338
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,560
work and I get a call and it's my old

339
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,320
apartment and they're like hey

340
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,420
um we have this package for like Grant

341
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,220
Hilton and we can't figure out who that

342
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,160
is so is that maybe you like this

343
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,540
package has been here for like three

344
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,540
months and I was like what

345
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,820
so I'm like yeah I will be right there

346
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,860
that's my package I promise

347
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,820
um so I go and I pick up this package

348
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,440
and you know I like get the bubble

349
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,060
mailer and like sit down in my car and I

350
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,980
like take a breath I'm like okay there's

351
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,040
no way that this actually worked right

352
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,740
so I get the thing and I actually open

353
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,660
up the bubble mailer and I see the book

354
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,639
I'm like okay there's no way he signed

355
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,800
this and so I open it and he actually

356
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,519
did sign uh John strand's book uh it

357
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,160
says for John be blessed Live Free or

358
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,560
Die signed I'm assuming that is John

359
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,579
strand right so he signed both the books

360
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,920
um and my next step was I was going to

361
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
come to a security conference like this

362
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,940
and actually give it to John in person

363
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,639
but uh again this was like you know I

364
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,620
wasn't sure when uh the next security

365
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,120
conference would be so I decided to get

366
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,800
into contact with like some of the

367
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,019
people at Black Hills and be like hey um

368
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,700

369
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,620
