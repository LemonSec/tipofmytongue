1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,560
hi everyone

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,259
I'm here to talk to you about imposter

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,320
syndrome I'm Elaine Harrison Newkirk and

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,960
I'm customer support lead for an amazing

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,839
startup company known as scythe I've

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,199
been in information technology for 15

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,160
years and the cyber security fields for

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,340
the last 10. I'm a mom of three amazing

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,380
young women and a bearded dragon named

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,098
taco who is also my office mate he likes

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,980
to hang out with me every day

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,500
um and I'm a volunteer Director of

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,940
Education for cyber security nonprofit

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,440
so my first question is

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,300
does everyone know what imposter

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,879
syndrome is

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,320
and

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,719
um what does imposter syndrome mean to

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,399
you

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
anyone want to yell it out

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,500
if they could tell you make it yeah

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
sometimes

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,100
so Merriam-Webster defines imposter

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,479
syndrome

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,040
um I'm not going to read it everyone can

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,460
read here but for me the word fraud

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,740
doesn't really fit

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,080
um I feel like a fraud would be someone

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,060
who's intentionally trying to deceive

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,740
people

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,900
um where with imposter syndrome you'll

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,659
you may not

33
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,040
necessarily think you're intentionally

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,960
wanted to see people but you might feel

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,759
like you are because you're putting on a

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,939
front

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,200
so I found this graphic on an imposter

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
syndrome blog I was looking at and this

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,200
kind of describes me every day when I

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
when I let imposter syndrome creep up on

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,680
me

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,320
um I'm always like worrying about things

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,140
I know I can't control

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,560
um like how long I have to sit in TSA

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,360
um for example

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,840
stuff like nobody else cares about and

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,699
then stuff that maybe you know somebody

48
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,459
mentioned but forgot about and I'm still

49
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,780
like worrying about it now

50
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,360
and there's a lot of self-doubt in

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,220
imposter syndrome

52
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,220
um these are thoughts I used to have a

53
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,020
lot when I was in different team

54
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,319
meetings I had a tendency to not want to

55
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,760
speak up because I didn't want to sound

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,220
stupid or

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,800
um you know there were other people in

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,480
the room that I thought knew more than

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,040
me so I would just sit there and be

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
quiet

61
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,239
um this is a list of characteristics of

62
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,900
imposter syndrome this is was in asana's

63
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,099
imposter syndrome article

64
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,959
and I'm sure there's like a million

65
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,720
other feelings and characteristics that

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,580
we have

67
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,739
um but I thought that this was pretty

68
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,099
fitting I know that for myself when I

69
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,500
start

70
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,620
having that those feelings again I'm

71
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,180
like worried I'm not going to do good

72
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,099
enough I think I need to like redo

73
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,220
things you know five or six times and be

74
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,260
perfect otherwise it's not going to be

75
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,620
good enough for the rest of the team

76
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,780
I think we do tend to work

77
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,220
kind of overworked I don't know

78
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,360
and then just you know always studying

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,620
really high standards for yourself

80
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,959
because you want to be as good as

81
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,620
everyone else

82
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,400
so I

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,319
for my experience in imposter syndrome

84
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,620
and a lot of people I've talked to

85
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,599
um you know like if you if you feel like

86
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,280
you're getting blown off or you're

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,739
giving out ideas at meetings and people

88
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,200
are just ignoring you or talking over

89
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,420
you that's gonna certainly feed into

90
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,819
your imposter syndrome

91
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,040
um you might compare yourself to other

92
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,099
people or maybe

93
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,560
other people your your managers your

94
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,659
teammates your family

95
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,858
um people you deal with in the community

96
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,298
intentionally or unintentionally put you

97
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,400
down or compare yours to other people

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,419
that doesn't help either

99
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,160
I did read a lot of articles I looked

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,139
for a lot of statistics and studies and

101
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,759
they're not out there

102
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,100
the majority of them do focus on women

103
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,419
so there are the women of women of color

104
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,880
or trans women

105
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,979
in the studies experience this more

106
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,040
often than other women and Then followed

107
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,380
by women who work in male dominated

108
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,120
Industries

109
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,759
I could not find any studies that

110
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,139
included men

111
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,900
so I mean there's a lot of men here I'm

112
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,520
hoping that this is going to help you

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
guys too

114
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,000
and I'm hoping that at some point maybe

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,500
there's more studies out there

116
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,280
so a year ago I had no idea what

117
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,380
imposter syndrome was I watched a

118
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,660
webinar it was a panel of

119
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,240
um black women in cyber and that was

120
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,940
sponsored by women in cyber security

121
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,979
and I was watching this and listening to

122
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,020
these women talk and I was like oh my

123
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,660
God that's what's wrong with me I have

124
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,820
imposter syndrome and then I thought

125
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,620
about it for a long time and realized

126
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,960
that I've had it like all my life

127
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,539
it started out when I was a kid I had a

128
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,840
stepfather who spent a lot of time

129
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
telling me that I wasn't good enough or

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,500
making me redo things because he didn't

131
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,440
like the way I did them and then

132
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,199
um as I went into High School

133
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,940
gym class

134
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,340
I mean if you're not athletic you can

135
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,320
identify trying to climb the rope and

136
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,660
not being able to or you know joining

137
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,880
Sports and the coaches are more focused

138
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,060
on the superstars that didn't help but I

139
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,820
did find my niche in high school with my

140
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,160
Commodore 64 in computer class which is

141
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,500
where I lived for four years

142
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,539
and then as I got into it I started

143
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,020
experiencing more of this because I had

144
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,139
a lot of older male managers who are I

145
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,720
call them old corporate who you know

146
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,280
didn't really feel like women could

147
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,759
necessarily do it so

148
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,720
um

149
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,240
I had a lot of managers interrupt me in

150
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,280
meetings or ignored my recommendations

151
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,139
until my male counterpart suggested it

152
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,860
um also just walking like walking by me

153
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,600
to talk to someone else and ask them to

154
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,639
do something which they then had to ask

155
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,620
me

156
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,680
um and my favorite was a CEO told me I

157
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,720
was constantly looking for reckon

158
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,120
recognition and that I should stop that

159
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,759
which I totally didn't get because I was

160
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,360
just like trying to get them to hear me

161
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,360
foreign

162
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,819
so can you recover from imposter

163
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,639
syndrome I don't think you can I did a

164
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,900
lot of reading and watched a lot of

165
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,240
videos and everyone says like it just

166
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,099
lurks there right

167
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,360
um

168
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,580
it's always just like this little creepy

169
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,800
troll waiting to jump out on you is how

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,680
I see it like I just I'm getting better

171
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,259
at it but it's there's still days where

172
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,620
it kind of creeps in for example when I

173
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,199
submitted the cfp for this talk

174
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,419
I did it just to do it but I didn't

175
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,220
think I was going to get picked and then

176
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,620
when I got picked I was like oh nobody

177
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,479
else submitted that needed to fill a

178
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,258
slot you know

179
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,080
so these these are my steps that I took

180
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,979
to get me on that path to recovery

181
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,440
um I got a job at Scythe a year ago and

182
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,259
they're amazing like everybody supports

183
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,020
everyone we we have the males females

184
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,199
everyone working there and they we

185
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,940
encourage each other to do stuff like

186
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,759
this so

187
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,759
my manager and my co-worker Tim

188
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,919
encouraged me to like write a blog and

189
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,900
then they encouraged me to submit for a

190
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,559
talk and so I did and I was like well

191
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,779
I'm not gonna get picked but I'll do it

192
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,940
like work past that worrying about

193
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,719
failing and just go do it I also joined

194
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,940
a mentor and mentee community on

195
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,980
LinkedIn and

196
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,279
um found that excuse me everyone's

197
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,959
really supportive there like you can

198
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,760
bounce ideas off people and we all

199
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,160
listen to each other like I found a

200
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,440
network of people that actually want to

201
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,120
hear what we have to say

202
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,880
and then I also go out of my way to help

203
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,339
other people and encourage them to do

204
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,040
the things they're afraid of as well

205
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,279
and um yeah I still doubt myself and my

206
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,320
abilities

207
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,820
but I remind myself that I do know

208
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,040
things other people don't know we're all

209
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,959
different we don't we're not all on the

210
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,080
same level of learning and

211
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,680
um

212
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,019
you know I may not be

213
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,540
as smart as some people or as good at

214
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,220
something as some people but I think

215
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,140
they probably feel the same about that

216
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,779
excuse me with me because nobody is as

217
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,420
funny as me so everyone feels that way

218
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,480
so here's my tips for kicking it to the

219
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,120
curve just know that you're amazing and

220
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,180
you can do things other people can't do

221
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,820
um find a supportive Network either a

222
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,019
group of people virtually or in person

223
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,140
and um if you have an unsupportive

224
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,360
culture or managers where you work it

225
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,680
might be time to find something else

226
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,180
like you don't have to deal with that

227
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,100
just

228
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,860
um you know there's a lot of jobs out

229
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,760
there

230
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,180
and it's okay to fail if you fail

231
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,100
you know try again it's going to push

232
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,980
you to improve and do better down the

233
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,160
road

234
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,320
and get out of your comfort zone just be

235
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,320
yourself and do the best you can and

236
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,120
then when those when that self-doubt

237
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,339
like starts crawling in you know try to

238
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,720
think of

239
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,060
um things that you are good at or

240
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,160
reasons why you shouldn't listen to

241
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,500
these other people that might be putting

242
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,959
those doubts in your head and just be

243
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,519
yourself

244
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,660
that's all I have

245
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,660
does anyone have any questions or

246
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,519
comments or input

247
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,399
yeah

248
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,800
that looked at the relationship or I

249
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,420
guess like the rates of imposter

250
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,740
syndrome and the actual difference

251
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,420
introverts

252
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,000
um I did find so the question was if I

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,620
found any like

254
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,140
um papers or statistics on introverts

255
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,540
versus extroverts I found a couple of

256
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,880
like college studies there were some

257
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,220
studies on college students that were

258
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,019
kind of like that

259
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,860
um but not a lot no no we're kind of

260
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,240
leaning towards like home sugar it's

261
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,720
being more like the advice

262
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,880
yeah they were in I mean I'm I'm an

263
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,459
introvert so I think I don't know like

264
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,560
in reality but a lot of people I've

265
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,300
talked to are introverts and they feel

266
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,940
that way too so it's probably like

267
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,399
harder for us to get out there and put

268
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,120
ourselves out there

269
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,339
the mentor group yep um there's actually

270
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,600
the link is in my slides and yeah just

271
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,940
you can join it and then

272
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,700
um we meet like once a month we'll start

273
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,200
meeting again soon

274
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,300
and it's like on a Saturday they do a

275
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,380
live couple hour video session it's all

276
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,459
virtual

277
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,339
yeah and um like if you want to do a

278
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,860
talk you can do a talk and stuff like

279
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,680
