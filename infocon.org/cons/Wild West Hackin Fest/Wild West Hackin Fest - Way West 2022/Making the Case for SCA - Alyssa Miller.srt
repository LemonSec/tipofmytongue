people up at a conference all right it's

7
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,799
way too sleepy in here I don't care how

8
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,320
many people are in here we wake you up

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,619
welcome to Wild West hacking Fest

10
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,080
there that come on oh my God we could do

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,659
way better than that welcome to Wild

12
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,380
West hacking Fest

13
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,659
see there we go we're like person again

14
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,080
oh my God this is like

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,159
I'm so happy we're getting back to the

16
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,140
conference scene we're getting out we're

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,600
with our people we're seeing people like

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Tony who is just up here talking about

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,100
the love getting back out here it is

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,400
awesome for those of you online my God I

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,840
wish you were here but I understand why

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,939
maybe you can't be

23
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,280
but let's dive in so I know we're a

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,840
little behind so I want to jump right in

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,399
this is me

26
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,759
really that's me I'm I flew that plane

27
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,200
for those of you that don't know I'm

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
actually working on getting my private

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,280
pilot's license that's something I've

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
wanted to do my entire life I'm kind of

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,479
at the point now where I'm in a life

32
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,500
situation I can learn to fly planes so

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,479
I've started doing that and that that is

34
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,000
the plane I'm learning in it's the ever

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,920
traditional Cessna 172 Skyhawk

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,500
okay why the hell is she up here talking

37
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,200
about flying airplanes well you see with

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,720
the airplanes maybe you know this maybe

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,459
you don't because if you fly airliners

40
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,379
you don't really get exposed to this but

41
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,940
weight and balance is actually

42
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,200
critically important when you're going

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,900
to fly a plane because how much weight

44
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,080
you have in that plane and how you have

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,300
it spread through the plane and where

46
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,420
that center of gravity lies is very

47
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,060
important for how the plane flies so

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,140
some of you might have had that

49
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,400
experience you're on an airliner and

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,780
they move you around they say hey we got

51
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,980
to move people to different seats

52
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,019
because of weight and balance issues

53
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,780
so one of the things they do and this is

54
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,519
where this is going I promise I'll get

55
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,440
to the point quickly or not so quickly

56
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,280
is in the Pilot's operating handbook for

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,400
the Cessna 172 is this chart this chart

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,140
as you see just a little piece of it

59
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,260
lists every piece of equipment that is

60
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,519
installed

61
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,540
on that airplane

62
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,800
its physical location that's what we

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,680
mean by arm in relation to a particular

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,680
point on the aircraft and its weight

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,019
so that we can understand every

66
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,239
component that is installed in any time

67
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,220
you make an update to that plane you

68
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,680
install a new altimeter you rip out all

69
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,019
the gauges and you put in a Garmin G1000

70
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,700
or whatever you're going to do

71
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,400
this stuff has to be updated because

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,500
you've got to understand what is that

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,620
plain way when it's empty

74
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,780
and where is the center of gravity when

75
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,000
it's empty so that as I start putting

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,560
people and luggage and other things in

77
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,120
there I can account for that and do the

78
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,159
calculations and figure out the weight

79
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,780
so

80
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,340
wouldn't that be cool if we had that for

81
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,440
software too

82
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,879
there's your hint of where we're headed

83
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,260
but first a little bit about me for

84
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,840
those of you that maybe don't know me my

85
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,519
name is Alyssa Miller I'm first of all

86
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,860
Hacker and a researcher those that you

87
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,599
of you that were here last night for our

88
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
panel you heard me talk about my first

89
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,140
hacks they were back in the days of

90
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,540
Prodigy so this is where I find out

91
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,478
who's as old as me or not

92
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,918
um if you don't know Prodigy is one of

93
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,660
these dial-up Services we had way back

94
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,300
in the day before we had the internet

95
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,000
publicly available

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,440
I bought my first computer when I was 12

97
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,240
broke into Prodigy it's kind of been the

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,360
thing I've done all my life is hacking

99
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,820
um I sometimes refer to myself as a

100
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,040
hacker turned executive because I am now

101
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,360
the business information security

102
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,300
officer for s p Global ratings

103
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,919
uh what's a business information

104
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,960
security officer I could write a

105
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,940
dissertation on it instead I just

106
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,040
created a Blog on it if you care go

107
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,080
check it out

108
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,300
I'm also an author and I was

109
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,360
aforementioned blogger and finally I'm a

110
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,940
former software developer so I got my

111
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,860
start despite all the hacking in my

112
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,720
youth despite hanging out in IRC chat

113
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,020
rooms with hackers throughout my teens

114
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,960
I didn't really get into security as a

115
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,139
job I started as a software developer

116
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:15,120
and that's given me some unique

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,820
perspective when it comes to how I deal

118
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,639
with security in ultimately Enterprise

119
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,039
organizations

120
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,240
so let's talk about

121
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,360
that thing let's talk about the state of

122
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,979
software development so back when I

123
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:32,940
started

124
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,060
software development was kind of an

125
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,240
interesting situation of well if I had

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,180
an application I would write that

127
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,880
application I'd write a bunch of code

128
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,400
and if my application if I wrote 80 000

129
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,440
lines of code I had an 80 000 lines of

130
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,639
code application it's that simple

131
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,979
well around 2004

132
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,440
we really started getting into the idea

133
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,320
of embracing open source and we started

134
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,039
to see things like package managers

135
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,080
Maven showed up on the scene now we were

136
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,699
using package managers before right I

137
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,259
mean we're using them in Linux distros

138
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,240
and things like that but using them in

139
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,620
software development really didn't show

140
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,259
up until about 2004 when Maven jumps

141
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,539
into the scene with Java and suddenly

142
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,460
now I can do this really cool thing

143
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,539
where I can define a bunch of

144
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,240
dependencies those dependencies are

145
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
managed by that package manager

146
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,280
including a catalog that references what

147
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,840
those names are and where to go get them

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,639
many of you if you've done any software

149
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,020
development today you're familiar with

150
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,539
this it's you know pretty much

151
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,819
ubiquitous to how we develop software

152
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:39,660
today

153
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,759
now the challenge or the really cool

154
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,800
thing but the really horrible thing is

155
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,520
that every one of these dependencies

156
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,800
can have its own dependencies

157
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,979
so I can write an application that's 80

158
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,160
000 lines of code but after it's built

159
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,660
and all those dependencies are

160
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,979
introduced we're looking at like

161
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,259
hundreds and thousands of lines of code

162
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,360
that

163
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,580
I never wrote I'm dependent on somebody

164
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,639
else and I can tell you I can go into my

165
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,740
manifest I can go into my pom file and

166
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,539
Maven I can say hey here's all the

167
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,500
dependencies I have

168
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,819
but I don't know the dependencies that

169
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,940
exist underneath these necessarily

170
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,860
so I mean this is all great right I mean

171
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,960
what what could possibly go wrong I love

172
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,880
working in infosec by the way I get more

173
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,680
mileage out of this gift or this meme

174
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,380
than any other

175
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,060
because really

176
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,840
what could possibly go wrong

177
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,000
maybe you heard of this company

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,319
maybe you know what happened to them

179
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,060
five years ago

180
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,520
maybe your data like mine was some of

181
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,160
the data exposed five years ago when

182
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Equifax got breached

183
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
lots of stuff to read on how this

184
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,639
happened but ultimately if you aren't

185
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,380
aware there was a vulnerability in

186
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,599
struts

187
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,180
commonly used open source software and

188
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,900
well hey someone found a vulnerability

189
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,639
published it in a cve

190
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,000
the cve was two months old when Equifax

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,580
got breached

192
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,620
Equifax the story if you talk to them is

193
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,199
that they didn't know it was there

194
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,699
they just didn't have visibility because

195
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,440
it was a dependency of a dependency it

196
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,300
was one of those sub-dependencies or

197
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,520
indirect dependencies or transient

198
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,319
dependencies they have all sorts of fun

199
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,240
names too but it all means the same

200
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,860
thing they're the dependencies we don't

201
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,219
know about because they are in that tree

202
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,500
and then maybe multiple levels down in

203
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,080
that dependency tree the end result was

204
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,799
164 million consumers worldwide

205
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,380
predominantly the U.S and the UK with a

206
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,660
few in France

207
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,360
had their data exposed

208
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,880
big settlement this cost Equifax tons of

209
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,100
money it costs the ciso of Equifax her

210
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,899
job

211
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,240
not good

212
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,220
but now we'll fast forward a little five

213
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,459
years later what happens

214
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,899
how many of you heard about log4j and

215
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,880
how to deal with this horse

216
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,740


217
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,160
all right this sucked all right but it's

218
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,040
the same story what is log4j it's just

219
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,820
another commonly used package again in

220
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,860
Java I'm not sure why we're picking on

221
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,420
Java but Java seems to be the thing

222
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,839
lately

223
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,060
it's used all over the place but

224
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,060
someone discovered this really cool

225
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,220
remote code execution vulnerability that

226
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,279
was trivially exploitable

227
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,140
all I needed was to be able to see your

228
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,399
application on the internet and I could

229
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,860
exploit it well that's

230
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,019
that's pretty tough

231
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,420
um three count them three cves

232
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,580
ultimately came out of this that first

233
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,839
one was the big one that was the one

234
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,880
that freaked everybody out and indeed

235
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,440
that's the one uh you heard me talk

236
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,700
about a little bit last night you know

237
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,680
showed up on a Thursday evening Friday

238
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,180
morning everybody was freaking out

239
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,540
91 of java applications

240
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,500
have some form of log for J in there

241
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,700
according to sneak 61 of the projects

242
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,200
that they that are in their platform

243
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,160
61 it was an indirect dependency so

244
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,019
that's something that the developers may

245
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,680
not have even known it was there

246
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,360
and this is where the problem comes in

247
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,200
but we weren't done yet or has my friend

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,240
Billy Mays would have said but wait

249
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,920
there's more

250
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,600
spring

251
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,700
yay

252
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,540
we're now into 2022

253
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,300
and 2022 stuff with a bang because most

254
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,880
people are still dealing with this one

255
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,279
spring for Shell because we're really

256
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,160
uncreative in our names by the way

257
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,560
three cves connected with this and other

258
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,019
rce

259
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,079
not nearly as trivially exploitable

260
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,200
think Heavens it requires a little bit

261
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,320
more of a uh a specific situation in

262
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,959
your configuration of your application

263
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,120
like you got to be using tomcad you got

264
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,100
to be deployed in a war a few other

265
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,120
things

266
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,220
but this is still especially on the

267
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,720
heels of log for Jay freaking people out

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,420
and it should be I mean it's definitely

269
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,300
not as big a risk but it's a problem

270
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,160
so

271
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,200
what is our answer to this

272
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,579
how many of you have heard of the term

273
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,560
s-bomb before

274
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,300
what does s-bomb stand for

275
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
come on you're like three you in that

276
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
same area one of you knows

277
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,360
yes the software bill of materials this

278
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,880
is that idea if you've ever built a

279
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,720
house

280
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,300
or if God forbid you're involved in

281
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,440
engineering somewhere and you've ever

282
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,540
built structures

283
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,240
or if you worked in manufacturing you

284
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,560
know there's this idea about build

285
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
materials which is basically kind of

286
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,519
like that airplane example it's this is

287
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,680
everything that goes into that product

288
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,120
so there's a lot of people in the

289
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,500
industry right now who are really

290
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,240
promoting this idea of a software bill

291
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,700
of materials how do we build out the

292
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,880
idea that here's a master list of all of

293
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,000
the software that's included

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,820
in the package product or whatever it is

295
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,440
that I'm selling to you

296
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,180
in fact

297
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,399
folks like Josh Corman and others have

298
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,940
championed this so well

299
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,260
the president of the United States

300
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,779
actually released an executive order

301
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,220
requiring any government contractor to

302
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,720
provide software Bill materials to

303
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,880
government agencies

304
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,380
wow

305
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,480
good luck creating that right by the way

306
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,920
if you're interested in the text of that

307
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,700
order

308
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,000
use I put a shortened URL link here just

309
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,100
because the link to the the White House

310
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,920
Press release is like a mile long so

311
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,779
that one's a little easier to remember

312
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,779
but I promise I don't get any like you

313
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,100
know weird promotion from that

314
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,880
but so this is where the industry is

315
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,740
going with this idea and it's a great

316
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,420
idea I mean we talk about asset

317
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,740
inventories we talk about all these

318
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,019
things and it's wow yeah it would be

319
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,519
great to have it but just like asset

320
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,860
inventories this stuff is hard in fact I

321
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,440
would say it's a lot harder even than an

322
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,899
asset inventory try imagine trying to go

323
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,220
through your code in all of those

324
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,260
directory trees and say Here's

325
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,600
everything that's in my software

326
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,279
but our industry has an answer

327
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,100
it's called SCA so SCA has entered the

328
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,339
chat what is SCA anybody know what does

329
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,500
SCA stand for you came to the talk do

330
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,800
you know

331
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,240
close

332
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,320
software composition analysis yes so

333
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,480
this is yet another cool scanning tool

334
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,899
that we can add to our product Suite yay

335
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,820
our developers love more security

336
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,740
scanning tools right

337
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,920
foreign

338
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,779
I came up here to talk to you about it

339
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,160
for a reason so there must be something

340
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,740
good a couple of vendors that are out

341
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,360
there now this is not a comprehensive

342
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,160
list so if you work for one of the

343
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,600
competitors of these places or you know

344
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,639
someone who does please don't hang me

345
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,019
I'm just putting some of the bigger

346
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,540
names up there all right sneak probably

347
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,980
the biggest one in this Marketplace

348
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,380
today but you've also got white source

349
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,420
which is what I use in my organization

350
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,600
black dock contrast security has some

351
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,459
capability around this as well there's a

352
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,260
bunch of others there's even some of

353
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,660
this capability that's built into GitHub

354
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,420
and gitlab spoiler alert it's provided

355
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,100
by sneak

356
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,860
um just in case you're wondering uh but

357
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,760
so we've got tools

358
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,519
so why does this matter

359
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,920
well if you if you had the opportunity

360
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,019
to read through the abstract for this

361
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,639
talk or you didn't just come because hey

362
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,699
it sounded kind of cool I don't know but

363
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,639
this is my experience with this and this

364
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,779
is why I've become such a proponent also

365
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,880
sidestep here

366
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,459
full disclosure I used to work for sneak

367
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,560
that is not why I'm up here talking

368
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,940
about this I don't work for them anymore

369
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,860
I don't care if you buy any SCA product

370
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,079
that's completely up to you I don't care

371
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,699
if you buy theirs or not completely up

372
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,680
to you but

373
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,100
I believe in SCA largely because of this

374
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,339
log for Shell shows up

375
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,100
Thursday night Friday morning we're like

376
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,660
holy crap we got to deal with this

377
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,680
eight hours later

378
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,959
eight hours into the start of a formal

379
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,360
incident which most organizations did

380
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,639
started up an incident because my God we

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,500
have got to address this thing it's

382
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,680
hideous it's ugly it's everywhere

383
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
most organizations didn't know where

384
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,880
they had this eight hours later I had a

385
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,820
laundry list of 948 places in the code

386
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,459
that's used across every application in

387
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,320
my Division I knew everywhere we had

388
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,060
versions of log4j I knew what version

389
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,260
they were I knew which ones were

390
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,699
vulnerable which ones were not

391
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,639
imagine the value of that

392
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,040
you walk into an incident I was talking

393
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,899
we had

394
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,779
quite honestly within two weeks we had

395
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,120
remediated every single internet-facing

396
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,100
application in our environment which

397
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,620
when you're talking about forklifting

398
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,560
yo something that is integral as

399
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
something like log 4J that's pretty

400
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,620
damned impressive in fact I'll tell you

401
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,660
that two weeks in when I was celebrating

402
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,920
the fact that all of our internet

403
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,199
Applications had been upgraded to

404
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,779
non-vulnerable versions of log 4J

405
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,759
I'm talking to my peers in the industry

406
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,680
and they're like yeah we're still trying

407
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,639
to figure out where this thing's

408
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,300
existing

409
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,920
and that's the reality of it because

410
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,660
that's how our code works I mean I think

411
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,820
back not too long ago there was a

412
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,500
vulnerability and I think it was an open

413
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,259
SSL that impacted

414
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,380
um medical devices and the FDA released

415
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,400
a statement on it and an alert

416
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,240
and they released it in very unusual FDA

417
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,980
fashion because it provided no

418
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,720
recommendations or specific recalls why

419
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,880
because none of the vendors nor the FDA

420
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,919
could say what products actually had

421
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,919
that open source library in them

422
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,079
so to be able to do that in eight hours

423
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,260
is incredible to be able to fix that in

424
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,240
two weeks which required massive coding

425
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,980
changes in some of these applications

426
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,240
because

427
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,919
this stuff ain't back where compatible

428
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,220
folks it was you know hey you're going

429
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,980
to change that it's it's logging it's

430
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,500
everywhere in your app I mean it it gets

431
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,179
used a ton

432
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,820
that was impressive and I wasn't alone

433
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,260
in this there were a number of people I

434
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,059
talked to who did have

435
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,280
similar programs in their devsecops

436
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,340
Pipeline and they too were able to

437
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,980
generate these inventories and very

438
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,720
quickly start responding

439
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,039
so

440
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,760
what's really interesting about SCA

441
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,380
is that

442
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,840
it really moves us to a point of

443
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,539
enabling the idea of devsecops right so

444
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:18,480
2008 Andrew Schaefer Patrick Dubois they

445
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,740
get together they create this thing

446
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,020
devops and they say we're going to make

447
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,539
devs and operations work toward the same

448
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,220
common goals and we're going to deploy

449
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,260
as fast as possible we're going to make

450
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,900
this smoother than ever we're going from

451
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,020
code to deploy in the smoothest possible

452
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,600
fashion and security said holy crap what

453
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,980
do we do

454
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,840
wait you mean we don't have those long

455
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
design Cycles where we can sit there and

456
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,039
do threat modeling and and all this

457
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,440
really cool stuff no oh my God you guys

458
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,660
are speeding up so 2012 only took us

459
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,820
four years to get on the train you know

460
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,340
Josh Corman and uh Gene Kim they go to

461
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,080
RSA and they give a talk

462
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,580
where they kind of introduce the concept

463
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,980
of deaf SEC Ops how do we get security

464
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,600
into this it's 2022 and we still as

465
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,539
security practitioners suck

466
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:10,380
at truly integrating security into the

467
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,140
dev secops pipeline

468
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,660
if you were here last night for Doc's

469
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,880
Keynote he talked about this a little

470
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
bit he didn't get into these specific

471
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,520
terms

472
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,340
we talked about that concept of you know

473
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,500
where we bring the tools we introduce

474
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,960
Gates we'd slow things down we're always

475
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,020
a cost to the development team we are

476
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,660
always a cost to the product we are the

477
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,220
thing that makes things impossible where

478
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,820
the department of no all of those things

479
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,980
SCA starts to move us beyond that

480
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,679
and the reason it does this is because

481
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,200
SCA more than any other security tool in

482
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,539
your entire Arsenal is geared toward

483
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,220
Developers

484
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,740
it plugs into their repositories it

485
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,260
integrates with their tools their CI

486
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,600
tools their build tools

487
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,039
it makes

488
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,440
a world of difference when you can meet

489
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,179
them where they live

490
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,520
now I'm not staying I'm not up here to

491
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,080
preach that SCA is the greatest thing

492
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,700
since life spread it doesn't

493
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,760
SCA will not find novel vulnerabilities

494
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,120
in anything okay I swear to God I'm not

495
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,000
up here to solve a product

496
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,160
but I am selling the concept because it

497
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,419
is important now this can be

498
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,220
accomplished with freeware tools as well

499
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,520
but understand that it's dependent on

500
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,799
things being reported as cves or being

501
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,960
discovered by researchers so it's not

502
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,500
going to find that open

503
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,539
uh you know SQL injection vulnerability

504
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,160
that one of your developers introduced

505
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,840
because somehow they bypassed all the

506
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,760
framework controls and are still

507
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,640
allowing free form text okay it's not

508
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,039
going to find those things now a lot of

509
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,140
the commercial providers are integrating

510
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,900
other capabilities with SAS and so you

511
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,299
can leverage a lot of that but the point

512
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,299
is again I I love the keynote last night

513
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,860
because it made a lot of points that I

514
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,140
wanted to touch on which is

515
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,299
we don't need to be perfect

516
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,820
but we need to be incrementally better

517
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,280
and this is one of those capabilities

518
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
when we can actually understand just the

519
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,840
software that we're dependent on those

520
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,580
open source packages that we're bringing

521
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,840
into our software what do they actually

522
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,419
mean where do they exist and can I

523
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,760
respond quickly so I am going to

524
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,500
identify vulnerabilities that get

525
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,940
introduced in the development life cycle

526
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,460
there could be vulnerabilities where hey

527
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,400
you know we've been using this version

528
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,580
of you know name your favorite package

529
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,140
and we just keep using that one because

530
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,880
we know how it works

531
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,260
well now when those things have

532
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,460
vulnerabilities you can find that in

533
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,900
your pipeline it's integrated in your

534
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,880
pipeline it shows up you know about but

535
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,260
better yet

536
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,960
is that scenario I mentioned where a new

537
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,059
vulnerability gets reported maybe in a

538
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,100
not so popular package

539
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,440
and now you get an alert where you have

540
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,840
that capability to find this

541
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,860
so

542
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,200
where this really works well is in

543
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,380
creating security Champions within your

544
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,419
development teams

545
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,580
what's a security champion

546
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,220
if if your concept of a security

547
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,740
champion because I know this is a idea

548
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,440
that gets tossed around about quite a

549
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,220
bit

550
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,080
if your idea of a security Champion is

551
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,640
that it's a security person who works in

552
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,020
the engineering team

553
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,059
we should talk after this

554
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,740
that is not what a security Champion is

555
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,679
about the security Champion should be an

556
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,960
engineer the security Champion should be

557
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,440
an engineer who is your advocate

558
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,020
or more importantly is an advocate for

559
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,120
secure practices who understands them

560
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,480
and can be that person within the team

561
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,299
who understands this and with tools like

562
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,600
SCA or with that capability one

563
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,659
oftentimes they can provide this again

564
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:52,980
you don't have to do this with a

565
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,480
commercial tool this can be done in

566
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,799
Eclipse you can actually walk a

567
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,780
directory tree so you can actually

568
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,580
catalog this stuff now is that going to

569
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,020
tell you every time a new vulnerability

570
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,000
shows up in one of those packages no you

571
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,500
would have to find a way to monitor that

572
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,400
the commercial tools do that okay fine

573
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,320
but what this starts to do is it builds

574
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,919
that enablement

575
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,960
devsecops if we really want devsec Ops

576
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,960
it's about us being an able to enable

577
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,960
able to enable wow I really just said

578
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,919
that

579
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,799
it's about being able to enable the

580
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,100
developers to do the security thing

581
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,039
without us having to watch over them

582
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,980
without us in security having to provide

583
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,919
stage Gates that slow them down see the

584
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,280
problem with the devsecops pipeline

585
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,559
is that it flows in One Direction when

586
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,240
it's working

587
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,159
so if we put stage gates in there that

588
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,440
have long feedback loops I say hey all

589
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,360
right when you go to build well you have

590
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,159
to run a security scan so we're going to

591
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,200
do SAS tool by the way that SAS tool we

592
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,940
ship it off to some third-party vendor

593
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,460
who does the scan it comes back in a

594
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,440
week and then if there's you know any

595
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
higher critical vulnerabilities well you

596
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,640
have to stop go back and fix that

597
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,220
you broke devops right there

598
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,960
and if you're trying to get security

599
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,000
introduced into that you just lost your

600
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
invitation to that party

601
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,740
so giving them tools that meet them

602
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,320
where they live is a great Advantage

603
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,280
here

604
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,440
now

605
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,059
as I kind of mentioned

606
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,419
incident response wants to join us too

607
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,340
because when you have an incident like

608
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,159
this log 4J this is a tool that makes a

609
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,260
difference this is a capability I should

610
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,820
stop referring to tools and refer to

611
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,158
capabilities because it is a capability

612
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,559
think back I mean literally being able

613
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,020
to provide a report like that hours into

614
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,360
an incident that says hey here's all our

615
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,620
stuff yes I did redact out the paths

616
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,200
because this is real

617
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,659
I told you 948

618
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,600
places we had this vulnerable package

619
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,580
that we had to respond to

620
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,620
we were able to produce this that

621
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,820
quickly

622
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,640
and the only reason it took that long

623
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,159
we're outside factors that slowed down

624
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,659
the initial capability to actually

625
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,340
generate the report

626
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,658
data was all there

627
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,799
so this is what we can do when we start

628
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,559
looking at the idea of our dependency

629
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,500
trees and understanding what is in those

630
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,580
dependent sea trees

631
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,480
but it goes on because guess who's

632
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,600
joined the the party compliance has

633
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,220
joined the chat

634
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,200
and

635
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,419
predictably yeah

636
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,820
we pick on compliance right compliance

637
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,860
of those people God we just we love to

638
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,720
hate them for some reason and I don't

639
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,700
understand it well I kind of do but

640
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,679
compliance people are amazing

641
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,200
I actually so I work in I mentioned who

642
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,960
I work for s p

643
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,220
um by the way if you don't know who s p

644
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,779
Global is you've heard of you've

645
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,120
probably heard of the S P 500 it's kind

646
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,220
of a big deal

647
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,559
um so

648
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,299
we are heavily regulated

649
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,880
I talked to 37 Regulators around the

650
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,539
globe every year

651
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,400
my compliance people are important

652
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,080
people to me

653
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,600
and you know what being able to make

654
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,460
them happy or give them the information

655
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,820
they need to do their job saves me some

656
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,620
really tough questions from folks like

657
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,219
the SEC

658
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,480
by the way if you've never dealt with

659
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,340
the SEC

660
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,260
pardon my French you have

661
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,340
do they around

662
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,860
no they not in my experience either

663
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,140
they are they are incredible people

664
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,000
don't get me wrong I don't mean to

665
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,299
disparage one bit I absolutely love what

666
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,039
they do many times sometimes it can be

667
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,480
tough to work with though

668
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,940
but they don't screw around

669
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,059
especially since 2001 they really

670
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,880
understand the importance of their role

671
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,260
so compliance is interested in this

672
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,159
compliance sees the value in this

673
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,320
because for one thing I can give them

674
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,380
really cool meaningful metrics

675
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,900
the metrics I can pull out of this

676
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,940
capability by understanding what is in

677
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,460
my software it is not oh hey yeah we

678
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,900
have a hundred thousand open

679
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,539
vulnerabilities or we have you know 5

680
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,520
000 critical vulnerabilities or whatever

681
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,659
those numbers are so meaningless

682
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,760
but when I can go in there and I can say

683
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,500
because this thing is integrated into my

684
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,240
pipelines I can say hey we did this

685
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,580
number of releases we identified these

686
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,740
we stopped if you remember from last

687
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,580
night's keynote we stopped this number

688
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,620
of vulnerable packages from being

689
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,919
introduced to our environment

690
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,779
that's something that's meaningful

691
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,520
you don't get that with some of these

692
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,559
other capabilities that we push we push

693
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,179
things like sast and dust and whatever

694
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,740
and the problem with those is it's it's

695
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,580
really hard to quantify a situation like

696
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,240
that because it's well SQL injection was

697
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,340
on these five forms but it had all these

698
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,559
different variants before you know it I

699
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,600
mean try to quantify that to somebody

700
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,480
you just to explain what it means you

701
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,640
get so deep this they can understand and

702
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,919
now in fact thanks to log4j and shelve

703
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,779
for spring for shell and all this other

704
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,100
business

705
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,600
they understand it a little bit more

706
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,220
than ever before because it speaks to

707
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,440
supply chain security there's a buzzword

708
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,080
that you can use to your advantage

709
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,799
supply chain security our open source is

710
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,080
our supply chain but this isn't the only

711
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,559
reason why my compliance people like it

712
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,559
licensing

713
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,200
this is something that gets really

714
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,140
complex in the open source market

715
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,600
because here's the thing

716
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,059
those licenses change all the time and

717
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,340
you may not get notified

718
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,440
you may have a sub dependency you don't

719
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,179
even know is there and somebody decided

720
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:21,240
to switch from one license to another

721
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,760
how do you know now you're releasing

722
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,799
that software

723
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,539
boy when you get that cease and desist

724
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,580
letter asking for royalties and stuff

725
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,200
for something you didn't know was in

726
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,360
your software that's a really panicked

727
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,500
feeling

728
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,340
so one of the side benefits of this

729
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,860
capability

730
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,159
is that I can look for licensing

731
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,980
and indeed both the open source there it

732
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,779
is open source tools and the commercial

733
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,240
tools available will help you with this

734
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,100
these are important things to be on top

735
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,080
of and your compliance people will love

736
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,299
you for this

737
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,039
to be able to say yes we're confident

738
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,620
that every component of our application

739
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,620
is appropriately licensed

740
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,779
that we don't have that risk exposure

741
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,860
that is huge

742
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,480
and your customers would like a word

743
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,240
that s-bomb thing I talked about

744
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,880
how many of you work in an organization

745
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,740
where your customers send you security

746
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,600
questionnaires

747
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,580
see at least one hand two three four

748
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,380
five I've been dealing with this for a

749
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,700
long time my very first security role

750
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,620
in financial services years and years

751
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,600
ago this was something we had to deal

752
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,399
with all the time

753
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,899
and usually it was because they came to

754
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,940
us first and they wanted to pen test us

755
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,159
all right I'm not letting every one of

756
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,320
my 5 000 customers pen test the same

757
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,580
system

758
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,179
we we do have to keep the doors open

759
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,740
um

760
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,380
so we got to the point of having to have

761
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,320
security questionnaires have the ability

762
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,659
to make our customers comfortable that

763
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,120
we were doing the right things

764
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,140
and if you're providing software or

765
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,620
firmware to your customers and something

766
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,720
like log4j happens I guarantee you

767
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,460
they'll be reaching out

768
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,380
if you're not hearing about it I promise

769
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,039
you somebody somewhere in the company is

770
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,960
we did it with our own vendors when

771
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,399
we're responding to log4j we were

772
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,200
reaching out to everybody

773
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,299
I had I had to talk somebody off the

774
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,740
ledge who wanted to go after Microsoft

775
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,820
and yell at them because we hadn't

776
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,380
gotten an answer from Microsoft in a

777
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,000
week

778
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,659
all right cool slow your roll they're

779
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,159
kind of a big deal I get it we're big

780
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,919
but they're big too so chill uh in fact

781
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,840
they're bigger than we are so slow down

782
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,799
but no that that's the reality of it so

783
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,659
your customers want to be a part of this

784
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:48,480
too and you when you have this

785
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,679
information and that's something that

786
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,659
you can provide them you can say yes

787
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,299
here's our software bill of materials

788
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,059
maybe you don't even have to follow you

789
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,740
know when we talk about s-bombs there's

790
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,419
a lot of talk right now a lot of

791
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,460
academics going on around formats and

792
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,559
how do we do this information sharing

793
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,000
even if you don't want to go to that

794
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,799
degree but just being able to say yeah

795
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,539
here's the list here's our dependency

796
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,880
tree here's the things somehow whatever

797
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,559
is acceptable to you without giving up

798
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,820
too much proprietary information

799
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,880
you have that capability now

800
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,100
so I brought you all here under the

801
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,299
promise that I was going to tell you how

802
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:26,760
to make the case for this because it's

803
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,580
great that we can all sit here

804
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,220
and we can talk about the wonderful

805
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,279
benefits and yeah wow Alyssa sure maybe

806
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,500
you all are kind of seeing what I'm

807
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,940
saying maybe you agree with me maybe you

808
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,399
think I'm full of crap I don't know

809
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,620
um hopefully you're all still here at

810
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,779
least so that's a good sign

811
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,580
um that maybe I'm I'm not totally

812
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,179
blowing smoke up your yeah

813
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,679
but how do you build a business case

814
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,500
because everything I've told you so far

815
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,320
if you go in there and you explain it to

816
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,960
your leaders whatever level you're

817
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,520
talking to if you explain it to that

818
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,740
business side the way I just explained

819
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,720
it to you I'm not sure you're going to

820
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,659
get the results you want

821
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,220
so let's talk about how do you actually

822
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,559
build a business case for this thing and

823
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,700
it all comes down to this

824
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,740
anybody who tells you cyber security and

825
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,419
by the way actually a side note sorry

826
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,640
gonna completely digress for a minute

827
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,100
let me go on a tangent here I use Cuba

828
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,440
Gooding Jr for this why does everybody

829
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,539
who uses this meme use Tom Cruise when

830
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,399
Kuba was the one who actually created

831
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,899
the line in the movie

832
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:36,600
I don't know sorry small pet peeve of

833
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,860
mine but it was actually if you listen

834
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,860
he's the one who first says the line

835
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,799
back to reality so

836
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,080
the reality is

837
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,940
this is what your Executives care about

838
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,820
anybody who tells you that your

839
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,559
Executives when you're a cyber security

840
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,940
leader and you go into a board meeting

841
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,500
or an executive committee meeting that

842
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,820
they want to hear about risk

843
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,659
get ready to see the door

844
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,740
because here's the problem when we talk

845
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,419
about risk and cyber security we assume

846
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:11,359
we are a risk that we are the the risk

847
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,179
if you don't have an MBA or you haven't

848
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,980
studied this in some way maybe this is

849
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,060
news to you but risk is a huge subject

850
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,500
there's business risk there's Financial

851
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,119
Risk there's Market risk there's

852
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,339
liability risk there's there are a

853
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,960
laundry list of things that make up this

854
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,580
Global thing we talk about is risk and

855
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,320
cyber security we're just one little

856
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,419
small dot in all of that

857
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,440
and here's something I like to tell

858
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,899
people

859
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:40,980
when they're thinking about how do we

860
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,418
talk about well we have to talk about

861
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:43,679
risk right

862
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,599
think about this for a minute if you're

863
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,040
going to go in and you're going to say

864
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,659
hey I'm going to enable your business

865
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,780
because I'm going to reduce your risk

866
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,960
I'm going to reduce the risk

867
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,380
business is all about taking risk every

868
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,020
product that they've put in the market

869
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,119
they have already considered the risk

870
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,000
they have already accepted the risk of

871
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,040
putting that product in the market all

872
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,660
of those various risks of which were

873
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,400
just that one tiny little dot in the

874
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,380
corner they have already considered that

875
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,660
and accepted it so reducing that risk

876
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,760
doesn't do anything to accelerate the

877
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,260
business at all all because they've

878
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,540
already said it's okay

879
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,380
even if they didn't understand it

880
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,560
they already said it was okay so when

881
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,839
you talk to an executive or you talk to

882
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,640
a business leader about I'm going to

883
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,900
reduce your risk you're basically

884
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,880
telling them nothing

885
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,260
you're telling them that yeah this thing

886
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,520
that you already said is okay I'm going

887
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,900
to make that Lesson by the way I'm gonna

888
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,320
I need a million dollar program to do it

889
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,500
all right that that's an effective uh

890
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,180
sales pitch

891
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,579
um so let's try something else how do we

892
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,440
connect what we're doing with business

893
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,700
objectives

894
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,300
again I I you know Doc's keynote last

895
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,800
night and I apologize if you didn't you

896
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,540
weren't there for it if it's recorded I

897
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,400
think it is please go check it out

898
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,020
because he made a lot of these same

899
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,560
points

900
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,020
what we do from security perspective has

901
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,180
to align with the business

902
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,520
has objectives we need to align with

903
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,900
them and we need to actually do things

904
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,960
that make it more efficient that make it

905
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,140
able to expand into new markets

906
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,200
to position themselves better so how do

907
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,300
we do that from a perspective when we're

908
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,420
thinking about I want to bring in

909
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,339
software composition analysis abilities

910
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,280
for starters I'm building faster

911
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,280
efficiency in our Pipelines

912
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,680
when I think about software development

913
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,020
and I think about tools that meet my

914
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,119
developers where they live that provide

915
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,000
me a significant level of security

916
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,440
assurance

917
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,780
without having to be the thing that

918
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,460
stands in the way or slows down the

919
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,060
pipeline

920
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,700
that speaks volumes

921
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,079
I'm going to make your development

922
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,880
faster

923
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,619
I'm going to help your engineers see

924
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,300
that the products they're using are safe

925
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,339
I'm going to help them figure out which

926
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,380
ones they can use

927
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,440
where they should be focused and now

928
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,119
they're not introducing new ones that

929
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,320
create

930
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,060
more backlog work for them

931
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,339
your engineering teams your devsecops

932
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,500
teams your devops teams whatever you

933
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,900
call them

934
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,800
they don't like big backlogs of bug

935
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,200
fixes

936
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,000
understandably so

937
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,980
your product teams definitely don't like

938
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,500
it because that's being spent on

939
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,960
Priority One issues that takes time away

940
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,000
from creating cool new features for

941
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,480
customers so if you tell them hey we can

942
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,760
introduce the security capability that

943
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,700
is actually going to allow us to deploy

944
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,820
more feature functionality quickly

945
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,220
that's a business value that's cyber

946
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,660
security stand up there and saying hey

947
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,700
we understand what's important to you we

948
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,140
understand the goals of the business and

949
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,400
this is how we're actually going to make

950
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,140
it happen

951
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,940
more effectively

952
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,320
so when you think about those repeatable

953
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,000
processes that doc was talking about

954
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,980
last night this is where we want to be

955
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,440
we are going to speed up those pipelines

956
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,000
we're not going to stand in the way

957
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,280
we're going to enable our developers to

958
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,740
do the security thing to create

959
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,660
ultimately and I love this term I got

960
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,680
from a colleague of mine a security

961
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,680
empowered culture

962
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
security empowered meaning they have the

963
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,460
ability they have the know-how they

964
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,200
understand how to do the security thing

965
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,780
without slowing down their job

966
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,000
without it being that extra thing they

967
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,099
have to worry about

968
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,140
okay great so Pipelines

969
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,520
well

970
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,740
what about incident response

971
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,880
they want it in on this chat

972
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,920
speaking to the ability to be resilient

973
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,880
this is where we have to flip that

974
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,619
messaging

975
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,900
we have to stop talking about the idea

976
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,359
of we're going to secure everything

977
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,119
focusing on being resilient

978
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:15,119
how can I reduce our recovery time how

979
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,260
can I make it so hey if I've gotta deal

980
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,800
with another log for J situation

981
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,079
yes I might have to pull some developers

982
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,940
from you know other projects that

983
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,920
they're working on but I'm pulling them

984
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,480
just long enough to get them to make a

985
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,820
code fix I'm not pulling them so they

986
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,000
can spend two days two weeks two months

987
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,859
sifting through code to try to figure

988
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,839
out where all we have a vulnerability

989
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,540
where all we have a vulnerable package

990
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,760
that's buried five levels deep in our

991
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,520
dependency tree I'm going to take all of

992
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,980
that out of the process so not only am I

993
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,320
again speeding up the pipeline I'm also

994
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,320
reducing our recovery time I'm making us

995
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,119
more resilient to attack because we can

996
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,240
address those attacks quicker

997
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,220
that's meaningful

998
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,900
that's something that drives a business

999
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,460
forward that's something that helps save

1000
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,599
money and helps ultimately make money

1001
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,700
if I can keep my Engineers focused on

1002
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,380
what they're supposed to be doing and

1003
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,200
not focusing on emergency responses to

1004
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,119
every new vulnerability that crops up

1005
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,339
and trust me there's gonna be more

1006
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,260
this is what we can talk about when we

1007
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,599
go in there and we want to actually

1008
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:29,460
share something of value

1009
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,560
we're not reducing risk we're not

1010
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,960
preventing breaches

1011
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,579
one of my

1012
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,200
one of my pet peeves sorry another

1013
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,000
tangent I'm great with tangents by the

1014
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,020
way

1015
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,760
another one iPad thieves is the person

1016
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,040
who walks into a meeting and I actually

1017
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,420
shared this last night so sorry if

1018
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,280
you're hearing this again but walks into

1019
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,540
a meeting where they're trying to get

1020
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,160
funding for something and they throw out

1021
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,119
this old cliche of it's not if you get

1022
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,640
breached it's when

1023
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,560
but by the way give me five million

1024
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,240
dollars so I can make us unbreachable

1025
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,520
great sales pitch

1026
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,099
how do you expect that one to go

1027
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,700
but we do that right so change start

1028
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,320
flipping that script because ultimately

1029
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,060
what we need to be looking at is how do

1030
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,680
we focus on strengthening our resiliency

1031
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,420
not perfection

1032
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,640
doc talked about this last night

1033
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,619
like I said I I was sitting there

1034
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,119
listening to his talk I'm like this is

1035
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,920
so perfect it fits right into everything

1036
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,020
I'm going to talk about tomorrow maybe I

1037
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,820
should just have him get my talk

1038
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,660
um but no seriously

1039
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,240
this is why okay if I focus on software

1040
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,160
composition analysis well what about SAS

1041
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,780
what about those novel vulnerabilities

1042
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,880
that my developers are introducing this

1043
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,619
leaves that Gap maybe we're not finding

1044
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,119
that

1045
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,460
maybe but you're taking a serious step

1046
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,320
forward

1047
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,540
you know those of you that are familiar

1048
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,119
with appsec or familiar with development

1049
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,880
you know what CI CD is continuous

1050
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,359
integration continuous and the uh try

1051
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,859
that again continuous integration

1052
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:07,140
continuous deployment

1053
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,000
what if we add one more CI to that

1054
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,880
continuous Improvement

1055
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,800
continuous Improvement needs to be the

1056
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,859
focus of our Security Programs not

1057
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:21,000
preventing breaches not creating you

1058
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,880
know impenetrable walls

1059
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,240
we are there to continually get better

1060
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,040
we know we're chasing a moving Target we

1061
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,920
know I I had a board member ask me so so

1062
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,260
when do we reach the point that we're we

1063
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,880
don't need to keep investing in

1064
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,760
additional cyber security measures my

1065
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,560
answer was well yeah when technology

1066
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,460
stops changing

1067
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,560
hasn't done that in my 44 years on this

1068
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,240
earth oh I just told everybody how

1069
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,400
old I am

1070
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,020
okay

1071
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,060
seriously I mean technology is not

1072
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,619
slowing down technology is changing more

1073
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:57,060
and more every day because with more

1074
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,859
technology that we create we create the

1075
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,079
ability to create more technology yeah

1076
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,579
that was a mouthful and I actually spit

1077
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,319
it out

1078
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,579
so

1079
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:09,060
stop focusing on that end State there is

1080
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,940
no end State stop focusing on being

1081
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,859
perfect stop focusing on being

1082
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:16,920
unbreachable unhackable whatever the

1083
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,940
term is that you hear the next you know

1084
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,060
vendor throw out there or whatever

1085
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,800
we derived vendors for doing that but

1086
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,599
then we do it in our conversations with

1087
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,180
our SEC our Business Leaders we act like

1088
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,160
we're going to stop the reach and then

1089
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,079
we say silly things like well it's not

1090
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,200
if but when okay well then stop telling

1091
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,400
me you need more money if you can't

1092
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,599
protect me from it I'll just buy

1093
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,920
insurance and

1094
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,599
cover it that way

1095
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,520
wonder why cyber Insurance got so

1096
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,500
popular so fast

1097
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,819
so keep that flip this script

1098
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:53,040
set that new messaging if you're going

1099
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,760
to go in there and you're going to

1100
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,740
propose anything whether it's software

1101
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,300
composition analysis or you're going a

1102
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,440
completely different direction you want

1103
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,480
to propose something else flip that

1104
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,520
script talk about something more of

1105
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,119
value to them and get them out of the

1106
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:07,740
mindset that we're ever going to achieve

1107
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,578
and then State here

1108
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,380
lastly

1109
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,579
information security cyber security

1110
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:19,440
whatever we want to call this role in

1111
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,020
our organization we have been chasing

1112
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,520
the Holy Grail

1113
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,700
and we've been failing

1114
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,859
there is one thing that means so much

1115
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:35,460
more to the business than anything else

1116
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,880
yes it's money but there's a specific

1117
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,339
piece of that

1118
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:43,980
we've talked about the idea of it I've

1119
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,099
seen Bruce Schneider on it

1120
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:50,579
I I've seen a number of different

1121
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,920
security people pontificate on it and

1122
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,339
talks the idea but I've not yet seen

1123
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,140
anybody

1124
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,660
actually connect

1125
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,920
does anybody know what I'm talking about

1126
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,599
what that Holy Grail is what is the one

1127
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,180
thing that you can bring to your board

1128
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,839
your Executives your leadership team the

1129
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,800
thing that's going to make the business

1130
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,960
stand up and say yes we want to support

1131
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,980
that

1132
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,319
we want to take a guess a wild stab

1133
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,619
profit this is what enables profit in a

1134
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,920
big way

1135
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,880
think about your marketing teams

1136
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,760
there is this idea of Imagine The

1137
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,440
Magical World

1138
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,560
where cyber security is a competitive

1139
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,060
advantage

1140
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,359
something we can go to market with in a

1141
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:46,200
way that is actually tangible

1142
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,440
that is not some dubious Claim about we

1143
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,359
take your privacy and your security

1144
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,259
seriously

1145
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,160
what if you can actually put something

1146
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,260
out there that is a competitive

1147
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,780
Advantage imagine the competitive

1148
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,540
Advantage especially in today's world

1149
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,900
whereas Tony mentioned last night cyber

1150
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,119
security has benefits from more

1151
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,920
awareness than we've ever had in the

1152
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,160
past

1153
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,660
imagine that world where then you can go

1154
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,040
out and you can say to our customers

1155
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,700
look we can provide you this s-bomb we

1156
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,319
can provide you this inventory this

1157
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,359
assurance of what's in there not only to

1158
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:26,339
say that hey we've done the work to try

1159
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:27,839
to make our stuff secure because that's

1160
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,819
this nebulous claim right that doesn't

1161
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:33,300
work nobody wants to hear that

1162
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,280
but what you are telling them when you

1163
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,020
say I can provide you with this and I

1164
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,640
can provide you regular updates with

1165
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,619
every release is you're saying I'm

1166
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,480
giving you the information that you need

1167
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,060
to be able to verify that my stuff is

1168
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,280
safe

1169
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,660
or

1170
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,660
to be able to know when it's not and be

1171
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,220
able to take appropriate actions to

1172
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,720
mitigate the risk in your network until

1173
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,980
I give you another update

1174
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,900
that is a competitive advantage in

1175
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,819
today's world that is something where

1176
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,380
you can actually take something about

1177
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,540
your cyber security program go out there

1178
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,660
credibly and talk to a customer and say

1179
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,760
this is what we're doing

1180
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,400
this is how we're helping make you safer

1181
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,200
this is how we're going to help enable

1182
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,140
you to use our products and be assured

1183
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,400
that they're safe for you

1184
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,900
that's something we've been chasing in

1185
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,760
cyber security for a long time we've not

1186
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,859
been able to do

1187
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:30,599
because it was always so nebulous oh we

1188
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:32,700
do pen tests every quarter we do pen

1189
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,280
tests every release we we run all these

1190
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,960
tools and yet somehow we still end up

1191
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,480
vulnerable again flipping that script to

1192
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,520
there's no end State here we know things

1193
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,720
are going to happen

1194
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,520
we know zero days are going to show up

1195
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,300
in our software

1196
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,380
but here's how you'll know about it

1197
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,300
right away and be able to take action

1198
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,700
without having to send us emails and

1199
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,020
harass us or

1200
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,079
do things of that nature

1201
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,579
so think about this differently when

1202
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:00,839
we're talking about making the case for

1203
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,880
something like this look at all the ways

1204
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,680
you saw I've presented to you all of

1205
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,200
those touch points all of those areas of

1206
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,819
the business that aren't necessarily

1207
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,000
just cyber security related that are

1208
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,099
improved by this simple capability not

1209
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,040
so simple capability simple okay yeah

1210
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,780
sure that's why people are selling tools

1211
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,020
that do it right not simple

1212
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,700
but important

1213
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,500
and when you do have the capability to

1214
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,180
do it it does feel simple

1215
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,599
so thinking back to that airplane again

1216
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,140
thinking back to how we can provide that

1217
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,619
same detail of yes here is every piece

1218
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,960
of equipment that's installed

1219
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,060
it sounds impossible when you think

1220
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,980
about how would you sit down with

1221
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,599
something like an airplane and do that

1222
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,880
and yet they do it the FAA mandates it

1223
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,579
and it happens we can do the same thing

1224
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,859
with software so I'm going to leave you

1225
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:54,839
with a really simple quote from Winston

1226
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:57,119
Churchill Perfection is the enemy for

1227
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,540
progress

1228
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,339
this fits right in with what's I think

1229
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:07,020
becoming a theme at this conference this

1230
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,800
time

1231
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,240
started last night with the keynote

1232
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,560
you're hearing here I've heard the same

1233
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,300
message in a couple other places Tony

1234
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,859
was just up here before me again

1235
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,819
delivering that message

1236
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,720
Focus

1237
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,180
on that continual Improvement

1238
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,180
flip that script bring that message home

1239
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,140
make that the expectation provide

1240
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,300
the metrics

1241
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,060
let's show that progress

1242
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,800
let's show how we're getting continually

1243
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,720
better not how we're tracking to some

1244
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,700
ridiculous goal of zero production

1245
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,680
vulnerabilities because it's never going

1246
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,760
to happen

1247
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,500
but give them something to use so they

1248
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,119
can measure the progress and see that

1249
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,980
we're constantly getting better

1250
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,500
so with that I invite you to reach out

1251
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,420
