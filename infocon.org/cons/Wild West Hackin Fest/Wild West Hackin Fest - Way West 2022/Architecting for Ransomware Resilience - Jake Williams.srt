1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,899
well hey so I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,759
ransomware resilience and building a

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,799
holistic data protection strategy and

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,300
all that stuff right

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,219
um so I almost feel like ransomware has

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,160
been talked about to death right

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
um that said all right we still suck at

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,539
it I mean let's be fair as an industry

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,119
right we still suck at well not

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,740
detecting ransomware because as it turns

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,960
out ransomware you don't need a strategy

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,820
for detecting it a strategy for

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,439
recovering from it it's the only malware

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,000
that announces itself it's like hey I'm

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,579
here right I've done the damage now what

16
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,260
right so

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,059
I want to talk a little about backup

18
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,360
strategies if I have one more CSO come

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,340
to me and say hey don't worry we've got

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,160
backups right I swear I'm gonna puke all

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
right the other thing we'll talk a

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,980
little more about this too Disaster

23
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,160
Recovery plans man no your Dr plan your

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,960
business continuity plan not sufficient

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,700
to deal with ransomware in any way shape

26
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,559
or form I also want to talk about the

27
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,660
double extortion or Data Theft issue

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,860
right I think a lot of us have heard

29
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,239
about this where threat actors are

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,340
stealing data from the network and then

31
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,559
saying hey pay us right or we're going

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,840
to release your data and then I'd be

33
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,220
remiss not to talk about limiting

34
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,920
lateral movement right so as I was

35
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,119
mentioned already and I'm wearing the

36
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,939
nice ions vest that they sent me but uh

37
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,860
here I work with ions research

38
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,840
I'm Alliance faculty I'm also the

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,340
director of cyber threat intelligence

40
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,540
over at Scythe they're one of the

41
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,040
sponsors please walk by their Booth as

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,100
well but uh at ions research I actually

43
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,080
teach a class on detecting the

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,200
precursors for ransomware right and this

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,659
actually came out of uh you know a as we

46
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,340
get into like the the kind of these

47
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,259
annual Cycles or the six-month Cycles

48
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,240
what have you our customer teams that

49
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,159
they go and well they go and talk to our

50
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,079
customers and say hey what do you need

51
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,939
to know about right and they then they

52
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,619
tap faculty to come develop material

53
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,900
like yeah we need strategies for

54
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,600
detecting ransomware and I'm like no no

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,060
you don't right you need strategies for

56
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,579
detecting lateral movement because at

57
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,920
the end of the day that's the thing

58
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,500
that's common across every ransomware

59
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,259
operation that we see I mean I have a

60
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,000
hard time thinking about anything else

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
that is 100 that happens 100 of every

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,038
ransomware operation with the exception

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,360
of course of encryption I guess that's a

64
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,680
gimme right but that's in the definition

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
right so lateral movement how do we

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,239
limit it how do do we detect it good

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
news as you start limiting lateral

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,720
movement or working to limit lateral

69
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,040
movement you're putting trip wires in

70
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
place right and the reality is that you

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,900
are then way way way more likely to

72
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,060
detect the precursors to ransomware

73
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,500
right before

74
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,959
and I hate this I hate shift left I I

75
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,720
just but but really left a boom right

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,340
you want to get left to Boom so that

77
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,599
we're not doing as much recovery not

78
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,099
doing as much cleanup so let's talk

79
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,800
about backup strategies right I I got to

80
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,239
tell you this this is the last line of

81
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,920
defense kind of issue right everybody's

82
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,840
been to the circus before right take my

83
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,760
kid to the circus right and sure enough

84
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,959
you know they got the trapeze artist

85
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,760
there they got a nice safety net there's

86
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,680
a I had a chance to go to a trapeze

87
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
Class A couple of years ago right it was

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,920
one of these like hey you know go go

89
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,660
live out your childhood fantasies thing

90
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,400
right and it turns out the first four

91
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,019
hours of that thing is how to fall into

92
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,900
the net that net is barely a safety

93
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,280
device in fact if you don't know how to

94
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
use it that net will F you up right and

95
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,620
you're almost I'm I'm sure less than

96
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,659
going Splat right but there's a there

97
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,519
are super chances of you hitting that

98
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,140
wrong bouncing out of the net and then

99
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,180
splatting on the floor again breaking

100
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,340
your leg in the neck there's a whole set

101
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,440
of things that can happen there so it

102
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,599
takes training even to use the safety

103
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,120
device your last line of defense backups

104
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,040
way too often we're cheating I'm like

105
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,319
don't worry I've got backups right I'm

106
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,700
like do you know how to use them and

107
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,739
they're like I have backups I'm like yep

108
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,440
okay good to go right by the way I've

109
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,120
done triple digit ransomware recovery

110
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,799
investment ransomware investigations and

111
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,760
recoveries I have never and zero I mean

112
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,920
it's rare talking episodes I have never

113
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,500
worked a ransomware recovery where

114
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,959
backups were used to recover a hundred

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,299
percent of the data they expected to per

116
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,159
the backup plan I'm not even talking

117
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,360
about the stuff that didn't meet the

118
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,799
recovery point or the recovery time

119
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,799
objectives I just mean that per the

120
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,440
documented plan they couldn't use it all

121
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,959
right now how close they got that those

122
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,459
are always the differences right some of

123
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,140
them were 10 of what they expected some

124
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,000
of them were 100 well not a hundred so

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,978
over 90 but again nobody gets to 100

126
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,440
percent there right so talking about

127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,720
backup strategies first off

128
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
if you take nothing else away from this

129
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,940
talk this is it go back and talk to your

130
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,979
GRC folks because a lot of them are like

131
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,680
we have a Dr plan well let me tell you

132
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
about your Dr plan or your Disaster

133
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,699
Recovery plan that was designed to

134
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,100
handle natural disasters it was designed

135
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,860
to handle non-sentient adversaries

136
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,020
there's never a point where you have an

137
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,520
earthquake that takes out your primary

138
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,380
data center site right and that

139
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,600
earthquake's like where's the backup

140
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,180
where's the secondary site let me see if

141
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,400
I can move over there right I mean I

142
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,960
know hurricane Ida last year looked a

143
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,220
little bit like that kind of Crossing

144
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,600
through the you know across of the

145
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
Midwest up to New York City right but uh

146
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,199
fun fact I was in Manhattan when the

147
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,820
tornado alarm went off right and we're

148
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,320
sitting in the you know sitting on the

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
14th floor at a restaurant with a couple

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
Insurance execs and see they didn't see

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,960
the alarm go off and phones are all

152
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,120
ringing and it's like seek low ground

153
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,340
move away from Windows I'm like we're in

154
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,380
Manhattan right like what are you gonna

155
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,419
do there right but anyway look bottom

156
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,460
line here shorter hurricane Ida you

157
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,560
don't have right natural disasters and

158
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,360
the kind of stuff that we plan Dr plans

159
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,759
around taking stop taking steps to

160
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,560
prevent recovery that's the major

161
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,120
difference that we see here when we talk

162
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,520
about ransomware and why your Dr plan

163
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,199
unless you've unless you've really gone

164
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,580
and said okay we're architecting this

165
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,280
around ransomware right again not a good

166
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,500
plan so what do we want to think about

167
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,660
offline backups talk about that in a

168
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,820
second immutable as well and then let's

169
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,620
talk about data only as and this is

170
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,780
something man the vast majority of folks

171
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,400
that I talk to them about about backup

172
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,440
plans do you have any data only backup

173
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,419
plans like all our systems are backed up

174
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,280
I'm like that's not what I asked

175
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,380
talking about your data I can rebuild a

176
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,479
system I can't reconstitute your data

177
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,360
right if you tell me you have a SQL SQL

178
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,460
Server you know 2013 well first off

179
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,320
don't right but but if you tell me you

180
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,940
have that and I'll replace that upgrade

181
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,740
it whatever all right I can rebuild your

182
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,840
SQL server in a few hours well I can but

183
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,479
I can find the right person too right I

184
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,100
can't reconstitute all your data right

185
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,419
and so we really need to start thinking

186
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,220
about data holistic backup so let's

187
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,620
start with offline backups offline

188
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,819
backups are the ultimate in

189
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,039
survivability threat actors can't Target

190
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,319
the offline backups because well by

191
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,020
definition they're offline

192
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,800
man are they high overhead oh wow are

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,539
they high overhead

194
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,220
I'm going to tell you here I don't think

195
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,139
they're cost Justified anymore all right

196
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,520
now

197
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,080
I want to be super clear here and say

198
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,180
that I have offline backups my

199
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,699
consultancy right prior to selling it I

200
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,800
absolutely had offline backups but not

201
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,020
of everything we had offline backups of

202
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,699
our most critical data almost like we've

203
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,020
done a data inventory and understood

204
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,400
exactly what we needed to be able to

205
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,319
recover right in order to keep the

206
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,699
business up and running in the event

207
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,380
that I don't know somebody targeted us

208
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,360
right and so

209
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,520
we can certainly get into some tiered

210
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,020
backups here but I will tell you the

211
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,460
folks that try to do a hundred percent

212
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,699
offline backups they actually fare worse

213
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,740
often fare worse than the folks that

214
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,319
have online only backups right now the

215
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,580
reason for this ends up being because

216
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,039
it's so high overhead that a lot of

217
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,419
stuff doesn't get rotated the way it's

218
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,620
supposed to right if you have full

219
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,940
offline backups you're bringing that

220
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,620
media back in and I'm not talking about

221
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,060
tape drives anymore right there are

222
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,620
folks that have entire San arrays that

223
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,479
that are taken offline there but again

224
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,280
that's a lot of overhead that's a lot of

225
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,259
work and consistently it doesn't get

226
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,720
done right because let's be let's be

227
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,419
frank life happens right so yeah I had a

228
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,520
plan to do it but I got a call from you

229
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,319
know a call from the spouse or you know

230
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,539
there was a you know a wreck and

231
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,280
somebody was late or you name it right

232
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,340
and then restoration right look gotta

233
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,500
tell you in the vast majority of cases

234
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,660
vast majority ransomware cases that I

235
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,080
work I advise the client to pay

236
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,880
I advise the client to pay and I want to

237
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
be super clear about this I know what

238
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,759
we're doing I know we're furthering the

239
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,199
ransomware ecosystem by paying the

240
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,060
threat actor but when you get into that

241
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,099
restoration situation it is all about

242
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,720
getting the business back up that's it

243
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,400
it's a pure play business decision you

244
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,020
got to take emotions out of it and make

245
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,660
it a purely transactional purely

246
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,280
transactional decision

247
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,620
are we going to get the business back up

248
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,500
and running faster right meaning putting

249
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,360
our employees back to work minimizing

250
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,759
our downtime maximizing our Revenue yeah

251
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,039
right by paying the threat actor and and

252
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,780
I got to tell you if you have offline

253
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,539
backups doubly so right if you have

254
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,399
offline only or primarily offline

255
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,779
backups so that's your survivability

256
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,260
plan for backups doubly so right because

257
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,059
again it takes a long time to bring

258
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,219
those things back online now mutable

259
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,020
backups I like these as an alternative

260
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,240
to offline because they're by Design

261
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,040
they're resilient threat actors can't

262
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,660
delete immutable backups there are a lot

263
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,000
of great vendors in the space certainly

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,860
a rubric kind of dominates the space

265
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,899
here but you know if you name a backup

266
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,700
vendor right practically all of them

267
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,600
today

268
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,240
have some some immutable backup offering

269
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,700
they differ a little bit in their differ

270
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,839
a little bit in how they're actually

271
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,100
administered

272
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,899
um but I love these right because the

273
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,399
threat actor even if they get admin

274
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,279
rights on your backup platform they

275
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,399
can't delete the backups right

276
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,779
that means you can't either

277
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,580
you have to plan ahead here and my

278
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,019
number one recommendation for this and

279
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,640
where I've seen it go really really

280
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,220
wrong and I mean epically wrong is that

281
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,080
you are storing immutable backups and by

282
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,519
the way the immutable the backups

283
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,200
themselves are immutable but the volume

284
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,120
the storage volume that they're on is as

285
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,399
well meaning that even if the threat

286
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,500
actor gets admin on your San they can't

287
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,720
then go delete the storage volume all

288
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
right well that's great

289
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,620
unless you need to dynamically resize

290
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,899
other volumes for something else right

291
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,240
which means then all these backups need

292
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,100
to sit in their own dedicated storage

293
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,019
pool all right so you've got to really

294
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,760
think ahead about this right because if

295
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,839
you're suddenly in an operational

296
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,700
situation where it's like I can

297
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,680
sacrifice some of this backup space for

298
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,740
right now I need this for operations you

299
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,240
don't you don't have that flexibility

300
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
this is a spot where you really have to

301
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,660
think ahead here or you can you can

302
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,160
really box yourself into a corner I've

303
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,779
seen it happen more than once it is not

304
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,279
a fun place to be

305
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,480
so

306
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,100
I want to talk to you quickly about data

307
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,380
only backups and this is a spot where I

308
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,779
I find so many folks that I talk to that

309
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:22,920
they they really haven't thought about

310
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,779
this at all right or haven't put a lot

311
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,399
of thought into this

312
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,680
by and large I don't want to restore

313
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,720
systems right by and large I do not want

314
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,220
to restore systems after a ransomware

315
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,500
event I want to restore the data right

316
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,360
the reality is that when a threat actor

317
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,279
has encrypted data on one of my systems

318
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,680
right unfortunately

319
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,860
um they've compromised that system

320
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,600
if they've compromised that system

321
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,180
what's my Assurance level right that uh

322
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,560
well the threat actor didn't put a back

323
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,180
door there and of course if I'm

324
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,760
restoring the whole system there's

325
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,320
always that question I have to tell you

326
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,240
that that doesn't happen often right

327
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,800
there's there's not a lot I don't have

328
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,360
many case studies right where the threat

329
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
actor dropped a back door in every

330
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,300
system they encrypted right and I

331
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,680
wouldn't expect to be everyone in any

332
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,779
case a lot of folks are like don't worry

333
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,700
Jake we detect that I'm like really

334
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,100
because it seems to me that the

335
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,779
ransomware event occurred precisely

336
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,660
because we didn't detect right the back

337
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,920
doors right where the threat actors

338
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,420
operating the environment for weeks

339
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,399
before right oh by the way obviously

340
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,660
it's going to be a different back door

341
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,040
than the one used throughout the rest of

342
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
the operation it sounds like a bad plan

343
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,420
to me to just go and restore systems and

344
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,160
by the way too for whatever it's worth

345
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,620
right if I suddenly am going to you know

346
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,360
migrate to the cloud because of this or

347
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,640
migrate some functions to you know to to

348
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,700
Cloud platforms I'm having uh data only

349
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,980
backups actually is a better place to be

350
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,600
right because effectively I'm standing

351
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,700
up new systems rather in the cloud and

352
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,160
another data center what have you if I

353
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,600
want to have a managed service provider

354
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,700
who I for instance don't trust myodata

355
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,920
or don't trust with my data I can still

356
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,959
have them building the systems and then

357
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,760
bringing the data in and layering or

358
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,279
restoring the data onto those systems I

359
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,860
will tell you here that this gives me a

360
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,720
much lower and I say potentially here

361
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,680
because I don't like to talk in

362
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,140
absolutes but usually it is a much lower

363
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,420
recovery point right so for those that

364
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,459
aren't familiar with RTO and RPO I know

365
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:12,660
we've got some folks in here that are

366
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,459
more like let me go pen test stuff and

367
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,260
break stuff right you'll hear the terms

368
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,720
RPO and RTO and we talk about basically

369
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,940
disaster recovery and business

370
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,860
continuity planning recovery Point

371
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,019
objective this is basically what am I

372
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,480
trying to restore to how frequently am I

373
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,000
backing up right so is my is my most

374
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,820
basically the longest expected outage or

375
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,300
so the longest expected uh

376
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,740
data point right that that I want to get

377
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,899
back to right so if I look and I say the

378
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,579
business would crumble if I can't

379
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,440
restore it within the last 24 hours and

380
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,720
my arm RPO has to be within 24 hours it

381
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,540
means I need at least daily backups

382
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,459
when you go ask business units

383
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,860
what do you need your RPO to be after

384
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,480
you've explained what an RPO is right

385
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,839
they never say ah 24 hours a week right

386
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,060
they're always like minutes well we can

387
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,800
never achieve that realistically we

388
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,660
don't achieve minutes when it comes to

389
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,079
RPO right why well first off there

390
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,700
certainly is the you know storage

391
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,139
requirements here how many of those

392
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,820
backups are you keeping but I know what

393
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,019
you're thinking right well we could take

394
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,579
a backup and then replace it 10 minutes

395
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,260
later or place it 10 minutes later and

396
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,240
well that takes Network bandwidth right

397
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,980
it takes a lot of network bandwidth as

398
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,139
it turns out if I'm only backing up the

399
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,120
data not the system I can collapse that

400
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,760
RPO a lot in the vast majority of

401
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,700
situations right so then we have the

402
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,860
higher RTO that's the recovery time

403
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,500
objective this is how long does it take

404
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,920
to get a system back up right so RPO is

405
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,339
the how fresh is my data the RTO is how

406
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,200
long will my systems be out so recovery

407
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,820
Point objective and recovery time

408
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,040
objective respectively

409
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,380
now you can't have your cake and eat it

410
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,839
too right data only backups they

411
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,300
definitely they need a clear Os or clean

412
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,579
operating system to restore onto right

413
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,800
and so as a result that means somebody

414
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,839
somewhere has to go build a clean

415
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,820
operating system right as opposed to

416
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,440
pressing the restore button and be like

417
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,120
restore the operating system with the

418
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,220
data right so what we're doing here is

419
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,019
we're trading a better recovery point

420
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,500
right for a probably higher recovery

421
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,139
time all right now I will tell you in

422
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,180
depends on the number depends a lot on

423
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,620
your business case right and even within

424
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,540
a given business the particular business

425
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,240
unit this may vary by but in most cases

426
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,000
I can suffer a little bit a little bit

427
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,120
longer down time if my recovery point if

428
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,220
I'm restarting operations with less data

429
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,560
loss right if you've never worked one of

430
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,240
these uh worked one of these uh

431
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,740
incidents before where you have a

432
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,660
catastrophic catastrophic loss like

433
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,579
happens with the ransomware

434
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,199
um you know even if we can restore back

435
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,240
let's have a 24 hour right 24 hour

436
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,000
recovery Point objective and and we have

437
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,040
high churn data we have to go back high

438
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,899
churn meaning it changes a lot during a

439
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,120
given during a given day that means I've

440
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,339
got a lot of reconstituting to do right

441
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,860
a lot of reconstituting to do if you

442
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,480
work in healthcare if you work in

443
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,459
finance this is all really really a big

444
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,100
deal to HIPAA by the way man the

445
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,540
pandemic has confused a lot of people

446
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,100
about HIPAA but I'll tell you something

447
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,899
confuses people even people that know

448
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,839
HIPAA right about HIPAA it's not just if

449
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,760
you lose the records it's not just that

450
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,920
the records get stolen if you can't

451
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,519
access the patient data that also right

452
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,260
or if you treated somebody and that data

453
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,660
is gone that is also a HIPAA violation

454
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,880
and it turns out as a matter of fact as

455
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,199
I've dealt with the office of civil

456
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,000
rights they're the folks over at HHS

457
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,519
that deal with that they tend to be a

458
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,880
lot matter about you losing patient data

459
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,180
than making patient data available right

460
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,680
so basically compromise of

461
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,779
confidentiality versus Integrity right

462
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,120
so basically threat actor steals the

463
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
data versus yeah so

464
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,339
in most cases I'll trade the lower RPO

465
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,899
right so lower recovery point for a

466
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,160
higher RTO

467
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,079
okay let's talk about some other backup

468
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,000
resiliency considerations right

469
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,920
um look storage is cheap it's nearly

470
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,620
free right who did the floppy disk talk

471
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,720
last night and was it it was uh Adam

472
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,399
Adam from Red Canary and you come to

473
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,199
whose slide or no sorry slide roulette

474
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,480
let's talk about why I love floppy disks

475
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,920
right and he popped up there and it was

476
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,760
like was it 720k or 1.4 megabytes for

477
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,139
the three you know three and a half inch

478
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,959
floppies storage is cheap it's just

479
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,779
cheap first off stop doing incremental

480
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,399
differential backups unless it's

481
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,699
absolutely necessary just stop right we

482
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,320
used to do this and and I get it they

483
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
still Teach an A plus right they still

484
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,579
teach in cissp you still need to get

485
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,620
your g-sac what's a differential backup

486
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,779
okay cool learn that and then forget it

487
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,279
right because the second you get an

488
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,500
operational Space Storage is so cheap

489
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,959
it's practically free you got to start

490
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,660
thinking about what is the cost of the

491
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,399
actual recovery because if you think

492
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,740
about a differential backup right I may

493
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,300
then have to go with minimum I have to

494
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,680
do two backups I have to restore the

495
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,759
base and I have to restore the

496
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,899
differential

497
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,420
I For the Love of me for life in me I do

498
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,920
not understand why anybody today is

499
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,600
doing incremental backups if you have a

500
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,060
weekly full backup and you get to the

501
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,140
end of that right and you're doing

502
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,939
dailies Beyond daily differentials or

503
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,559
sorry daily incrementals you're

504
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,799
restoring the base right plus each one

505
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,599
of these incremental backups and man

506
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,059
does this take forever and by the way we

507
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,859
all take all kinds of time to practice

508
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,900
our disaster restoration procedures

509
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,079
right no no it's your system admins who

510
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,819
have never actually done this before

511
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,679
right and definitely not the systems

512
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,079
they need to it's it's the it's the

513
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,400
absolute train wreck that you would

514
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,600
expect

515
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,400
something else to note here ransomware

516
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,640
rarely encrypts database files they

517
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,320
encrypt the beginning of the database

518
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,880
file

519
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,460
and sometimes little spots throughout I

520
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,539
say the beginning usually a couple

521
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,640
megabytes right so most ransomware

522
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,500
checks the file size this isn't

523
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,520
something unique specifically to

524
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,440
database files but they check the file

525
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,059
size and then go encrypt the beginning

526
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,820
and they encrypt throughout right and so

527
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,919
I say encrypt throughout meaning like a

528
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,140
little 4K chunk here and a 4K chunk 50

529
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,299
megabytes in and what's really cool

530
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,559
about this and by the way the reason

531
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,760
they do this the reason a lot of

532
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,020
ransomware does this and I'm not talking

533
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,820
about all ransomware because I'm the

534
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,340
sample somewhere that fully encrypts 100

535
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,679
of the database right

536
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,539
the reason they're doing this is that it

537
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,100
doesn't take a lot and particularly with

538
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,419
that first couple of megabytes gone

539
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,120
right your database parser can't read

540
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,039
the file anymore there's specialized

541
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,320
recovery software can go in and grab the

542
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,179
data back out of the database because we

543
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,740
do it all the time

544
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,620
right and so oftentimes that's my

545
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,000
fastest way to get back up and running

546
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,559
because by the way especially if you

547
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,360
have I don't want to talk bad about a

548
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,520
company that rhymes with snorkel but if

549
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,140
you happen to be using them as a

550
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,600
database engine right backups there are

551
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
tenuous to say the least I guess is a

552
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
good way to put it and so oftentimes

553
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
they're able to recover very quickly

554
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,380
using that method right going through

555
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,720
and parsing that database file I do also

556
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,679
want to mention a lot of us aren't

557
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,240
hypervisors and as we get into

558
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,059
hypervisors man we over subscribe

559
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,679
everything on hypervisors almost by

560
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,900
Design but worry over subscribing the

561
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,419
most is iops all right so input input

562
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,880
output operations disk usage when you

563
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,100
have to suddenly go restore a bunch of

564
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,679
systems simultaneously whatever you

565
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
thought your recovery time was going to

566
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,120
be oh buddy right you can even test it I

567
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,919
love when folks like yeah Jake we tested

568
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,900
it we tested we're restored the system

569
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,340
we thought it was going to happen and

570
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,419
three hours happened in two and a half

571
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,179
it was great I'm like neat how many

572
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,700
systems are high prices 300 how did you

573
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,380
restore like one

574
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,360
I'm like let me do some math for you my

575
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,340
friend right and so all of a sudden that

576
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,840
three hours that you're expecting turns

577
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,000
into three days right and again that's

578
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,559
that's not an exaggeration by the way

579
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,200
then we get into remote sites and oh my

580
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
gosh man remote sites and people like

581
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,360
yeah yeah I'm we're gonna we're gonna go

582
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,919
and restore back to that remote office

583
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,720
over there and I'm like oh cool what's

584
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,160
what's the connectivity there and

585
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,320
they're like yeah yeah it's five

586
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,080
megabits and I'm like cool FedEx for the

587
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,299
win right and they're like no I'm like

588
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,700
yes 100 I'm gonna race you right I'm

589
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,340
gonna ship a drive and I I assert with

590
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,500
high confidence right that my my next

591
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,600
day overnight right or the before noon

592
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,919
overnight there

593
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,720
um I'm gonna have that there and back up

594
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,100
and running long before you do it over

595
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,600
the network all right just as

596
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,160
operational realities all right so this

597
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,360
is a lot of stuff that folks don't think

598
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,760
about there from backup resiliency

599
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,860
let's talk about double Extortion data

600
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,940
theft

601
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,280
again if you take I said one thing away

602
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,320
it was the Dr piece second thing I want

603
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,940
to talk about DLP

604
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,980
done dozens of double extortion

605
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,440
ransomware investigations and DLP has

606
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,620
never been a consideration not once

607
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,120
not like ever

608
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,580
not an alarm that somebody ignored and

609
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,960
then we found it in the end we're like

610
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,580
oh if only they paid attention to this

611
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,299
alarm no no not even that all right DLP

612
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,360
just isn't a consideration ever it's the

613
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,860
wrong control for the job by the way I'm

614
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,140
not pooping on DLP here DLP does great

615
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,580
things

616
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,440
for you know kind of like using the

617
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,940
right tool for the job here does great

618
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,880
things in its intended use case this is

619
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,039
not it the number of regulators the

620
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,720
number of csos the number of folks that

621
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,220
think that DLP is going to stop double

622
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,260
extortion I've even seen some DLP

623
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,940
vendors right talking I was like yeah

624
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,440
you don't Ransom or threat actors

625
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,880
stealing your files and I'm like well I

626
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,900
don't but you're not going to help me

627
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,480
with that right I mean it's just the

628
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,520
reality so

629
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,080
um what about double and triple

630
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,059
extortion ransomware operations right

631
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,559
it's a double extortion here basically

632
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,120
threat actors are stealing data from the

633
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,860
network before they begin the encryption

634
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,880
process

635
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,799
the triple extortion cases they're

636
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,320
stealing it and then they're contacting

637
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,080
business partners customers and saying

638
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,539
hey hey your data got compromised

639
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,880
through these other folks and if you

640
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,799
don't want that data to be public you'd

641
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,360
better pay us right so they're trying to

642
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,880
compel more payments right so this is a

643
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,860
really interesting kind of Paradigm here

644
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,900
but the reality is none of this works if

645
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,159
you detect the threat after removing the

646
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,360
data from the network in the first place

647
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,280
they're still going to encrypt your data

648
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,840
once look once the threat actor is in

649
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
there right even if you catch them late

650
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,620
stage we we've seen a lot of folks try

651
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,960
to race to encryption at that point but

652
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,700
you know again I can recover from the

653
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,159
encryption side without paying here I I

654
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,780
am making a kind of a calculated

655
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,760
decision here about paying the threat

656
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,380
actor to prevent them from releasing the

657
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,000
data now I want to be like super clear

658
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,440
here right

659
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,240
um and Uber's uh former Chief security

660
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,919
officer will tell you all about this

661
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,960
well he's under Federal indictment but

662
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,820
anyway he'll tell you all about this

663
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,200
later once he's done with the Federal

664
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,820
indictment once they've they've finished

665
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,500
that whole case there

666
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,740
um you do not you do not and this is not

667
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,000
legal advice because I'm not a lawyer

668
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,700
you do not ever pay a threat group right

669
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,919
and then try and cover up the breach

670
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,200
right you can't pay them to make sure

671
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,640
the data doesn't get released and be

672
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,580
like cool nobody knows about this nope

673
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,380
nope for those that aren't familiar with

674
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,299
this the the Uber Chief security officer

675
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,460
did it wasn't a ransomware case uh but

676
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,780
he did something very similar right

677
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,700
they're threat actors uh you know

678
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,220
basically executed data breach

679
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,620
um they tried to extort a little bit

680
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,960
um he created a bug Bounty program Uber

681
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,460
previously did not have a bug Bounty

682
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,460
program uh he created one and then paid

683
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,140
them a hundred thousand dollars right

684
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,539
and they're like cool but they didn't

685
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,700
tell anybody and so it turns out this

686
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,200
this comes out in an audit right and

687
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,220
this is actually not what he's under

688
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,320
indictment for when law enforcement

689
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,880
comes and talks to you when the FBI

690
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,799
comes to talk to you right or any

691
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,240
federal law enforcement for that matter

692
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,820
all right you can well let me super

693
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,380
clear here I'm not advising over a lot

694
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,940
of the cops but local law enforcement

695
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,919
right that that's not a federal crime

696
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,900
but or a crime at all in Most states

697
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,360
right but lying to federal law

698
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,520
enforcement agents is itself its own

699
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,260
crime and you know Flynn can tell you

700
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,240
all about that right I mean you get into

701
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,400
this and this Uber CSO that's what he's

702
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,260
under indictment for right not the

703
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,640
originally covering it up but but then

704
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,500
lying to the line of the regulators and

705
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,240
the investigators on the back end

706
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,679
so how do we detect this stuff in the

707
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,860
first place large outbound flows go

708
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,260
watch your outbound flows I can't tell

709
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,940
you how often I ask folks do you have

710
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,919
netflow and they're like

711
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,380
well we have firewall logs I'm like well

712
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,900
that's not the same thing right firewall

713
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,179
logs are not netflow right so I want to

714
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:01,440
know I

715
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,880
just

716
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,039
test us okay cool we dropped out for

717
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,159
Segment okay I want to know not just the

718
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,200
uh basically not just that's something

719
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,059
but I want to know how much data went

720
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,159
out and if I can do layer 7 protocol

721
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,039
decode even better right even better if

722
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,539
I can do any protocol detection even

723
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,700
better right now I do want to note here

724
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,140
right that with file synchronization

725
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,419
tools you have to really really really

726
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,400
pay attention if you've ever looked at

727
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,140
how Dropbox or OneDrive or any of those

728
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,120
tools work on the back end they are not

729
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,159
shipping out your data in one big flow

730
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,720
it's not like one giant file like your

731
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,460
FTP and gigabytes out of the network

732
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,679
right they're breaking the file into

733
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,380
dropbox at least 64k chunks and then

734
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,840
they're shipping that out over https

735
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,340
right so if you have an https connection

736
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,840
and they ship a little bit of data and

737
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,700
so you've really got to pay attention in

738
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,000
aggregate right in aggregate overall so

739
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,919
this this is really tough right I worked

740
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,380
a case a few years ago where

741
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,020
DLP again right Yandex disk was actually

742
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,179
used to go exfiltrate I want to say

743
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,980
somewhere in the neighborhood

744
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,500
is it 130 140 gigs I can't remember the

745
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,480
exact amount of data way too much data

746
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,340
right so threat actors if you're not

747
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,539
familiar with Yandex the index is

748
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,280
Russian Google right so the big search

749
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,020
engine in Russia just like Google has

750
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,580
Google Drive the index has the index

751
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,520
disk and so they use Yandex disk to go

752
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,500
basically to install that they're like

753
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,120
install that and then they just dragged

754
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,440
and dropped they had an RDP connection

755
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,940
and they dragged and dropped from the

756
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,100
file share and the SharePoint site right

757
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,840
and they just drive to routing the index

758
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,400
disk folder and it just exfiltrated

759
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,539
right on out

760
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,400
the organization was like well hold on

761
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,559
Cesar says Jake we deploy DLP and I'm

762
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,880
like does your DLP work with the index

763
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,919
disk he said what's the index disk like

764
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,679
exactly right and so and he's like well

765
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,720
we have firewall logs I'm like do you

766
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,580
right we might look to the firewall logs

767
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,840
he's like yeah we alert on any

768
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,820
connections over 10 megabytes

769
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,340
right okay well neat right that have

770
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,779
more and I'm like by the way what's your

771
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,820
alert volume on that 10 megabytes by the

772
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,860
way any connections that transfer more

773
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,779
than 10 megabytes he's like and then we

774
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,279
looked and it's the alarm volume it's

775
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,840
like through the roof oh and by the way

776
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,799
what's the sock done with that

777
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,559
suppressed all those alarms right and so

778
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,760
because of course they have because

779
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,559
you're alarming eight times a minute

780
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,240
that's not an exaggeration by the way

781
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,679
eight times a minute

782
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,140
a previous audit in a previous audit

783
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,000
right actually in a previous Wireless

784
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,039
hacking Fest I talked about event logs

785
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,240
the last year in Reno as a matter of

786
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,220
fact how to tune your event logs right

787
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,140
in a previous audit they had determined

788
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,940
that they needed to look at file level

789
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,220
logging file level access logging so

790
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,840
that when they turn that on

791
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,400
it was awesome they had lots and lots of

792
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,779
logs so we could see exactly what was

793
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,020
taken 100 of exactly what was taken over

794
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,140
the last 18 seconds right so that was

795
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,120
problematic and I and by the way last 18

796
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,340
seconds was the last 18 seconds before I

797
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,200
got to the logs right

798
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
um so you know they tuned they turned on

799
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,440
a bunch of stuff but they didn't

800
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,779
increase retention for said logs right

801
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,419
so cataclysmic set of failures here look

802
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,940
for outbound flows and then actually

803
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,799
think about the tools that are being

804
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,380
used today all right so speaking of

805
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,120
tools that are being used today our

806
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,139
clone and mega

807
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,039
there is never and I mean this never

808
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,679
back up unless you work in cyber threat

809
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,460
intelligence there is never a reason for

810
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,220
a corporate entity to connect to Mega

811
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,320
there is never a reason for a corporate

812
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,480
entity to connect to Mega

813
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,580
right it's one of the first things I

814
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,799
look for if you have DNS logs are there

815
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,500
connections to Mega nothing good happens

816
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,740
on Mega right that's the guy with a huge

817
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,120
mega account because I work in cyber

818
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,240
throat intelligence but right so look

819
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,559
Mega if you're not familiar with this

820
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,600
you may remember kim.com used to be mega

821
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,820
upload way back in the day after the

822
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,320
feds took him down he's over in New

823
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,000
Zealand now

824
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,919
um and uh they really re-architected

825
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,020
that to the point that they themselves

826
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,419
can't see your data

827
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,340
so your password when you first create a

828
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,440
mega account you set that password and

829
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,320
they tell you 100 right if you lose this

830
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,600
password we can help you recover a

831
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,000
password you will not recover your data

832
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,039
because that password is used to seed

833
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,539
the encryption key

834
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,820
such that they cannot be compelled to

835
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,380
give up your data

836
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,240
so if you set a strong password and they

837
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,440
won't even let you they won't let you

838
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,299
forget the week you know like your

839
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,340
password has to be pretty ridiculously

840
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,140
uh I say ridiculously but it has to be

841
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,640
pretty strong right

842
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,940
um so spread actors love this because

843
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,740
it's a hundred percent law enforcement

844
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,000
resistant

845
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,039
now the problem is most threat actors or

846
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,299
many threat actors are operating on the

847
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,980
command line so how do I transfer data

848
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,419
to Mega I I certainly am not going to

849
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,159
install the client right I'm certainly

850
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,360
not going to open a web browser

851
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,340
certainly for the command line our clone

852
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,400
for the win right now our clone is not a

853
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,260
malicious tool necessarily our clone is

854
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,640
used for all kinds of data for

855
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,059
operations but is it used in your

856
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,640
environment I would almost call this a

857
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,679
potentially unwanted application I

858
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:53,940
wouldn't call it a little bin in this

859
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,620
particular case because low bins are

860
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,600
living off land binaries it's it's not

861
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,159
that it's not there with your operating

862
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,220
system right but threat actors use this

863
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,020
all the time right so go look at your

864
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,580
process execution yes as a matter of

865
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,200
fact if you're watching this talk today

866
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,080
go look at your EDR search through your

867
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,539
EDR for all executions of our clone and

868
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,299
if you find any go figure out why right

869
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,919
and honestly if you've got a system

870
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,919
admin that's using arclone right and I I

871
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,720
probably would

872
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,520
I probably would tell them to stop so

873
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,260
that I can create an alarm for our clone

874
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,000
right because this is something that is

875
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,380
going to happen before the encryption

876
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,820
the threat actors are finding your data

877
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,679
and Excel trading your data using our

878
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,080
clone this is a great precursor to the

879
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
actual encryption during the ransomware

880
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,919
operation right of course remember it

881
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,600
can be renamed right that is a reality

882
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,880
good news vast majority of productivity

883
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,159
don't rename our clone and if you have

884
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,659
the right EDR you can actually look at

885
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,100
the metadata for the executable so

886
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,120
renaming it doesn't really matter

887
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,100
because most threat actors definitely

888
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,720
don't change the metadata

889
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,580
so let's talk about minimizing lateral

890
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,860
movement right it's a component of every

891
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,020
successful ransomware operation every

892
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,100
single one of them

893
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,720
there are relatively few methods

894
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,000
relatively few methods a couple of years

895
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,120
ago why was hackfest and Jonathan Hamm

896
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,159
he actually was a contractor for me at

897
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,720
the time he was keynoting Wild West

898
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,159
hackfest in Deadwood in maybe 19 20. I

899
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:18,659
can't remember which year it was but he

900
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,399
called me up and he said he's like Jake

901
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,460
I want to do a threat hunt live on stage

902
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,320
right he's like I want it to be

903
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,360
something that is command and control I

904
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,799
talked about a live on stage part right

905
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,779
for a lot of reasons but but he says

906
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,399
yeah regardless I want to go hunt a

907
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,440
brand new command and control or never

908
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,120
before seen he's like will you write one

909
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,960
for me

910
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,580
he's like I want to write it I'm going

911
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,559
to go deployed a client Network one of

912
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,820
our client networks is like and then I'm

913
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,559
going to go use the Telemetry to go hunt

914
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,960
it so that we can look for how do you

915
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,279
hunt something that's never been seen

916
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,539
before

917
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,860
I was like if you get the client

918
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,419
authorization to do this game on man

919
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,820
I'll write the new C2 right did it in a

920
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,440
couple hours right and wasn't that

921
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,360
worried about it if he came to me was

922
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,039
like Jake I'm gonna go hunt lateral

923
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,899
movement create me a brand new lateral

924
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,340
movement technique I had to tell them to

925
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,140
pound sand because we're not talking

926
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,580
about four hours we're talking about

927
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,220
weeks right weeks to create a new

928
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,659
never-before-seen lateral movement

929
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,580
technique and honestly it's probably

930
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,380
going to be a variation of one that

931
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,600
already exists right whereas command and

932
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,440
control

933
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,200
data exfiltration game on like Myriad

934
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,440
ways to get this done right so it's a

935
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,880
natural choke point for detection

936
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,100
engineering for both reasons right one

937
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,320
because there's so few ways to do it and

938
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,059
two because it's a necessary component

939
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,399
of these operations

940
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,200
so we start talking about techniques I'm

941
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,580
not going to get into the Myriad

942
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,640
techniques here but they all rely on a

943
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,039
very small number of protocols

944
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,340
SMB ah RPC that's been in the news

945
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,840
recently huh all right so RPC RDP

946
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,020
Powershell remoting and SSH right

947
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,460
what other protocols have you seen in

948
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,799
lateral movement I mean I've used some

949
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,820
right

950
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,919
have you SQL injection right or even a

951
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,539
connection to a SQL Server right and

952
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,520
certainly if you've done Microsoft SQL

953
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,860
you remember XP command shell right if

954
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,840
you're on a if you're on a MySQL server

955
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,460
I see somebody pump in the back yeah XP

956
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,960
command shell all right

957
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,419
um and then there's you know MySQL right

958
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:15,059
um you've got uh MySQL you can do the uh

959
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,039
if you don't have app armor or SC Linux

960
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,779
configure right you can do the select

961
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,460
into trick right where you then go low

962
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,740
to you know load a plug-in I mean

963
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,880
certainly there are some other tricks

964
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,100
here but but they're super dependent on

965
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,320
you know third-party software right or

966
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,840
client software on the systems supposed

967
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,399
to like core part of the operating

968
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,740
system right if you're old enough to run

969
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,779
a remote shell like rsh all plain text

970
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,419
stuff remember dot R host files right

971
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,460
but so we don't have that anymore I mean

972
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,419
unless you're you know like in the

973
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,039
Wayback machine you're using super

974
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,840
Legacy technology that means you're

975
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,640
probably in healthcare right

976
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,220
um so Network segmentation coming into

977
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,960
the lateral movement stopping lateral

978
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,880
movement it's Network segmentation for

979
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,620
the win right

980
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,140
I wish I could go back and make that top

981
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,360
sentence super bold matter of fact that

982
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,980
top sentence probably belongs on its own

983
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,899
slide like we were seeing a minute ago

984
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:08,039
there is no reason and I mean no reason

985
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,260
for most endpoints saying to most other

986
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,320
endpoints using any protocol

987
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,880
not only the protocols that we just

988
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,019
reviewed

989
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,779
when clients workstations right so when

990
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,519
an endpoint a workstation endpoint talks

991
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,919
to another Workstation

992
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,659
one of those workstations is by

993
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,279
definition a what

994
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,580
a server yeah right which means it

995
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,039
doesn't belong on a workstation subnet

996
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,960
now I get it right we've got a lot of

997
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,640
folks in it that have been around a long

998
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,480
time I myself am a proud mcsc 2000 right

999
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,700
mcsc security no less right from for

1000
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,679
Windows 2000 all right

1001
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,600
um so so I've been around a while I get

1002
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,000
it right but I've also moved on right

1003
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,320
I've also moved on from that time

1004
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,820
there's a lot of folks that are like

1005
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,919
yeah yeah I said don't worry you can I

1006
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,539
remember it's part of the mcse right you

1007
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,220
had to learn how to go install like

1008
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,919
internet connection sharing services on

1009
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,380
Windows 2000 Workstation

1010
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,880
Internet connect I mean like remote

1011
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,940
access services on workstations right

1012
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,919
um absolute Madness right

1013
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,800
um look the reality here is that you

1014
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
have to limit you have to start

1015
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,639
reconfiguring your networks so that you

1016
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,080
don't have workstation stock and

1017
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,580
workstations this means Network

1018
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,739
segmentation it means creating

1019
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,679
boundaries where I can apply inter-vlan

1020
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,199
Access Control lists look back in the

1021
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,239
day before we had virtualization in Mass

1022
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,060
I get it it was a big deal to go in and

1023
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,300
relocate servers right consistently when

1024
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,918
I do Network segmentation and I start

1025
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,918
locking down with private vlans

1026
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,000
consistently what ends up happening is

1027
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,520
we start finding servers under people's

1028
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,940
desks right and by servers I mean a you

1029
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,320
know small form factor workstation

1030
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,719
generally two they have hard drives plug

1031
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,399
USB hard drives plugged into them right

1032
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,719
where they use the Best Buy procurement

1033
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,179
method right and so there then we have

1034
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,280
terabytes and terabytes of regulated

1035
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,440
data and you know the good the best part

1036
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,839
about this is I mean I appreciate it

1037
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,580
when you know Geek Squad definitely

1038
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,320
advises folks on the way out using the

1039
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,119
corporate credit card right to make sure

1040
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,619
you bit Locker encrypt that bad boy

1041
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,540
since it'll be storing regulated data so

1042
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,280
that nobody like so the cleaning crew

1043
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,720
doesn't accidentally walk off with it

1044
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,820
all right I did an investigation at a

1045
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,099
hospital a couple years back three four

1046
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,500
four years back uh four years back and

1047
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,839
the entire investigation involved

1048
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,060
uh basically they were relocating

1049
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,720
offices and uh they say they meaning a

1050
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,640
group of medical transcriptionists were

1051
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,280
relocating offices and so they packed up

1052
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,140
the office in one area and they went to

1053
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,880
unpack it in the other area and there

1054
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,040
was a server under somebody's desk right

1055
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,839
so another small form factor workstation

1056
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,060
with three

1057
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,520
five terabyte hard drives unencrypted

1058
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,040
right with scans of patient data right

1059
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,380
so scans of patient data and the best

1060
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,300
part was as they moved those two of them

1061
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,880
made it to the destination

1062
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,760
and the other one did not

1063
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,560
the other one did not hey remember that

1064
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,880
HIPAA thing we were talking about before

1065
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,160
yeah that sucks right turns out they

1066
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,540
didn't actually encrypt the data but

1067
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,240
even if they had even even let's assume

1068
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,820
for a minute that the shadow I.T right

1069
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,160
had gone and encrypted those hard drives

1070
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,260
do we still have a problem Oh yes we do

1071
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,380
right we lost five terabytes of patient

1072
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,339
data

1073
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,720
all right now I know what you're

1074
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,099
thinking right was it really full of

1075
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,079
five terabytes I don't know right

1076
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,119
neither do they all right so we have no

1077
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,859
idea what the usage was We Could

1078
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,119
reconstruct what the usage was but you

1079
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,700
get the idea there all right so as we

1080
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,200
start doing Network segmentation there

1081
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,760
because suddenly this is the way to

1082
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,160
detect this we found dozens more

1083
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,720
situations like this this large

1084
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,520
Healthcare organization by the way we

1085
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,900
did find the hard drive

1086
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,099
um so we did actually find the hard

1087
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,079
drive get some good forensics folks

1088
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,420
there we went and found the um went and

1089
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,040
found the vendor ID and the product ID

1090
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,200
and then we scanned the entire network

1091
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,760
looking for anywhere else that

1092
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,220
particular Drive had been plugged into

1093
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,500
and we found a machine and it turns out

1094
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,359
that somebody had five finger discounted

1095
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,680
right so it moved from Best Buy

1096
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,240
procurement to Five Finger procurement

1097
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,660
and had increased the storage of their

1098
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,160
workstation

1099
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,780
by the way it was still a HIPAA problem

1100
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,339
because they formatted the drive

1101
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,859
removing lots of data that we no longer

1102
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,980
had access to right but but still better

1103
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,900
as it turns out is still better to be

1104
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,040
able to go back to the regulars and say

1105
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,099
hey we know we totally borked this but

1106
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,260
we kind of recovered right it's not the

1107
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,700
worst worst case scenario it's just like

1108
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,920
a mini worst case scenario right

1109
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,119
um look the reality here is

1110
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,280
virtualization now there's no excuse for

1111
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,420
this right

1112
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,760
um one of the Kickbacks that I hear on

1113
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,099
this is micro segmentation Solutions are

1114
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:37,079
expensive and my response to that is

1115
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,700
neat right

1116
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,320
um You don't need those you don't need

1117
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,940
expensive micro segmentation Solutions

1118
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,500
you know sd-wan you don't need a bunch

1119
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,020
of that yes it makes it easier yes it

1120
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,540
makes it easier right but you can

1121
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,700
absolutely architect how many vlans do

1122
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,540
you get

1123
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,160
how many of you lands come on this is

1124
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,920
cissp like oh never mind no this is a

1125
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,020
Security Plus maybe Network plus it's

1126
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,020
4094 right so by default you get 4094

1127
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,820
vlans and that's before you get into

1128
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,280
complicated Network and you can expand

1129
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,540
that number obviously with some

1130
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,339
complicated network topologies but

1131
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,920
without without even trying it 4094

1132
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,839
vlans

1133
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,339
I'm thinking most of us don't

1134
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,079
necessarily need micro segmentation

1135
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,119
solutions to VLAN our stuff in a way

1136
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,040
that we can go to access control lists

1137
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,320
right so and again I do want to be super

1138
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,579
clear I'm not saying don't invest in

1139
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:24,960
that stuff I'm saying that don't make

1140
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,000
that a barrier to you implementing some

1141
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,099
Access Control lists here to lock down

1142
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,099
and prevent lateral movement right

1143
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,339
oh buddy LOL been alerting right so

1144
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:36,839
living off land binaries I mentioned

1145
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,359
this is our clone right but with the

1146
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,800
increased adoption of EDR and endpoint

1147
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,200
controls threat actors use more low bins

1148
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,720
practically every day

1149
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,220
um what we're seeing here effectively is

1150
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,839
that threat actors know that when they

1151
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,359
bring along malware or even potentially

1152
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,760
unwanted programs right we call puas or

1153
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,660
pups

1154
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,220
who has potentially wanted application

1155
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,220
pop is potentially want to program

1156
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,720
you know they they know that the EDR

1157
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,180
might flag on that but a wool ban is

1158
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,380
just something built into the operating

1159
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,480
system it's already there

1160
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,700
and how do you how do you turn around

1161
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,560
and say well that Microsoft tool man

1162
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,359
that that's definitely illegitimate

1163
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,700
that's bad that execution of it's bad it

1164
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,140
takes a lot more work so we have to look

1165
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,380
at the overall context of this right and

1166
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,240
so edrs are they're just bad at

1167
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,460
detecting uh detecting malicious uh

1168
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,680
malicious use of old men's and I do want

1169
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,000
to throw a Powershell in here right

1170
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,040
Powershell a lot of folks talk about you

1171
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,300
know talk about Powershell detections

1172
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,920
Powershell is wicked difficult to do

1173
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,260
good detections with edrs Will typically

1174
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,820
err on the fault on the side of false

1175
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,680
negatives because a false positive is a

1176
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,180
denial of service

1177
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,160
right if you have a false positive

1178
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,859
detection and the EDR stops that right

1179
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,119
because remember EDR is not just

1180
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,440
endpoint detections endpoint detection

1181
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,780
and response right and it stops that

1182
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,700
execution you have broken something that

1183
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,440
was supposed to be working

1184
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,420
you need to capitalize on this Advantage

1185
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,480
right the fact that we know spread

1186
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,940
actors are studying the tools we have

1187
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,859
this in the Conti dumps in the Conti

1188
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,480
dumps they are specifically trying to

1189
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,760
get a hold of carbon black and sofo CDR

1190
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,980
so that they can build bypasses for

1191
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,720
these they are studying the edrs they

1192
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,820
know what is and isn't getting caught

1193
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,560
all right make no mistake about it right

1194
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,839
and so you can capitalize on this

1195
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,940
because what they can't know are your

1196
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,339
detections you got to go engineer

1197
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,680
detections around low bins period and a

1198
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,240
lot of that comes down to understanding

1199
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
what wool bins are are used for

1200
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,560
equivalent by threat actors this this

1201
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,980
list 100 this and x86 Powershell this is

1202
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,099
the powershell.exe in CIS wow 64. all

1203
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,240
right if you're not familiar with CIS

1204
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,240
file 64 that is the that is the x86

1205
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,420
emulation system in a 64-bit Windows if

1206
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,700
you see x86 Powershell that is a danger

1207
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,500
danger danger danger kind of moment

1208
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,380
right danger danger moment

1209
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,820
now look there are some other ones up

1210
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,440
here obviously bits admin we see that

1211
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,000
one used a lot actually that's a pretty

1212
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,099
good one as well because you know very

1213
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,500
infrequently as it used legitimately

1214
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,480
we get some other ones though man on the

1215
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,960
hard Side Run dll 32 I see it used all

1216
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,520
the time but differentiating good from

1217
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,800
bad there really really difficult wmic

1218
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,500
net shell reg server all those pretty

1219
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,660
difficult to do it's funny I have a lot

1220
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,700
of folks like I alert anytime who am I

1221
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,440
as Ron I'm like really

1222
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,980
really I mean who am I slash priv yes by

1223
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,359
all means right because how often is

1224
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,339
that run but who am I is all kinds of

1225
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:25,980
logon scripts right now you may look at

1226
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,599
a sequence of commands and say oh I

1227
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,280
recognize that that's Bob's logon script

1228
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,480
right it's the one that Bob this is

1229
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,220
admin wrote well that's fine but your

1230
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,540
EDR vendor doesn't know that and that's

1231
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,400
why they're not alerting on it right so

1232
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,839
again with the right tuning the right

1233
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,760
detection engineering you know you can

1234
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,980
get around this stuff but um

1235
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,079
so I'm going to wrap up with a couple

1236
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,460
closing thoughts here and then I'll get

1237
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,320
to questions if we have any

1238
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,060
um a ransomware resilience doesn't just

1239
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,920
happen I mean like any other resilience

1240
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,420
ransomware resilience doesn't just

1241
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,740
happen it's something you actually have

1242
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,359
to plan for it's something you have to

1243
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:55,740
architect around

1244
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,300
we know the double extortion and

1245
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,700
increasingly triple extortion right is a

1246
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,500
component of ransomware operations and

1247
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,900
so and also for whatever it's worth it's

1248
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,760
something that a lot of Executives ask

1249
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,200
me about they're like Jake what if they

1250
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,520
steal my data I'm like they're going to

1251
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,020
right if you haven't architected

1252
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,460
anything to detect it's right after

1253
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,079
stealing your data and by the way not

1254
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,820
just ransomware threat actors right

1255
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,680
before ransomware it was mostly Data

1256
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,440
Theft right so why why

1257
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,940
if I'm gonna rant for just a second here

1258
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,520
why do we suck so bad at this like why

1259
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,500
is this a thing now where people are

1260
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,420
coming back hey we've been addressing

1261
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,280
the ransomware problem for years do you

1262
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,780
know there's a double extortion thing

1263
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,099
where they're stealing our data first

1264
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:33,540
I'm like before ransomware they were

1265
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,940
stealing your data right like how are

1266
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,300
men okay so look again the bottom line

1267
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,280
here is you're going to help detect not

1268
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,920
only them but extortion only operators I

1269
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,240
don't like to make a lot of predictions

1270
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,619
when it comes down to a cyber security

1271
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,079
predictions age horribly

1272
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,640
but I'll tell you one prediction that I

1273
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,900
have and that's you're going to see less

1274
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,280
ransomware and more extortion operations

1275
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,300
and the things that keep me up at night

1276
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,339
it's not ransomware it's the extortion

1277
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,440
only operations I'll tell you why I

1278
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,020
think this right well first off on the

1279
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,460
extortion only operations these are

1280
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,500
folks that are stealing your data right

1281
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,880
so they're taking your data out of the

1282
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,980
network they're not encrypting your data

1283
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,260
they're contacting and saying hey

1284
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,940
here's my demand for payment and if you

1285
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,160
don't pay me I'm releasing this data I'm

1286
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,079
selling some of this data right they're

1287
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,339
very articulate about telling you what

1288
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,800
they have this sounds a lot like why

1289
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,880
would they do this when they could do

1290
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,619
that and ransomware

1291
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,240
most of the folks The ransomware

1292
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,339
Operators are doing double extortion I

1293
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,140
have no idea what they're stealing none

1294
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,359
okay there are some tools right there's

1295
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,980
been some some tool analysis where we

1296
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,940
see some of the strings they're

1297
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,619
searching for or they're like go find

1298
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,060
these things then just exfiltrating

1299
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,020
right so they're searching for Strings

1300
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,800
like illegal right or pii or credit card

1301
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,780
number and so any files that have those

1302
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,280
they just suck those up it's actually

1303
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,319
like sounds like almost anti-dlp right

1304
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:50,880
so it's like pattern matching and

1305
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,260
instead of like blocking it from going

1306
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,760
out they're like yeah make sure it goes

1307
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,859
out well obviously there's a quantity

1308
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,960
problem here right but all they're doing

1309
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,099
basically when you get to double

1310
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,680
extortions focus on quantity not quality

1311
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,240
most of the time we see the data that's

1312
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,560
stolen and these double extortion

1313
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,660
operations it's garbage this is garbage

1314
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,520
right anybody ever been to a ransomware

1315
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,140
leak site and looked at some of the data

1316
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,000
that's been leaked you look at it you're

1317
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,500
like how could I use this and the answer

1318
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,020
is I can't right the vast majority of

1319
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,240
cases I can't these extortion only

1320
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,280
operators oh buddy

1321
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,740
they know what they're taking

1322
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,180
because that's a hundred percent their

1323
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,339
focus it's a hundred percent their focus

1324
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,260
also in these operations you see a lot

1325
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,000
less lateral movement because you don't

1326
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,740
need to have lots of lateral movement

1327
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,819
because you're not encrypting a bunch of

1328
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:35,940
systems you only need to get to the data

1329
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,280
and most often that can be from

1330
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,480
practically anywhere with the right

1331
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,680
credentials I can hit the SharePoint

1332
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,560
site I can hit the uh in some cases rare

1333
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,599
cases database server right I can

1334
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,040
certainly have my cloud storage I can

1335
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,780
certainly hit my uh hit my file share

1336
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,579
all right in many cases we've seen

1337
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,260
extortion only operations where the

1338
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,200
threat actor has not gained domain admin

1339
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,000
because they don't need to

1340
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,740
right they land on the comptroller's

1341
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,700
machine

1342
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,560
they have access to the finance share

1343
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,440
and they simply siphon it off they know

1344
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,880
what they're going after

1345
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,980
also I'll tell you the other reason that

1346
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,300
I think this is going to become a trend

1347
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,040
here you may have noticed that after

1348
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,920
after Colonial pipeline followed by JBS

1349
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,079
meets suddenly the US government got

1350
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,000
really really concerned about ransomware

1351
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,099
to the point that they started I don't

1352
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:22,560
know involving cyber Command right and

1353
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,420
you can ask our evil or Revel how we

1354
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,400
prefer to pronounce it here are evil

1355
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,260
um how that worked out for them and the

1356
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,660
answer is not well right

1357
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,280
um so um

1358
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,859
the US government and I'm not obviously

1359
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:36,000
I don't speak for the US government here

1360
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,440
but but the US government doesn't give a

1361
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,420
darn about data theft

1362
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,640
they don't I got multiple OPM

1363
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,319
notifications right my data was breached

1364
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:46,140
repeatedly they could care less we have

1365
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,700
Decades of History showing they could

1366
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,099
care less about Data Theft I don't mean

1367
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,540
care less but they certainly are getting

1368
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,920
cyber command involved and putting

1369
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,020
Warheads on foreheads right or at least

1370
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,940
cyber Warheads on foreheads right when

1371
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,440
it comes to and when it comes to Data

1372
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,420
Theft but you mess with our supply chain

1373
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,280
you mess with Colonial pipeline you mess

1374
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,140
with JBS meets to the point that we have

1375
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,380
pork shortages right they care right and

1376
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,460
I think you're going to see operators

1377
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,020
we've already seen some chatter right

1378
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,940
where operators are reacting to this so

1379
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,960
I think you're gonna see more of this

1380
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,740
extortion only operations finally not a

1381
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,180
limit it's a blast radius of ransomware

1382
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,640
but this is key it increases

1383
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,980
opportunities for detection left of boom

1384
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,839
right

1385
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,460
Ray how long do I have I got four

1386
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,380
minutes

1387
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,599
I have as much as I want game on so if

1388
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:31,859
you'll bear with me for a second I want

1389
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:33,060
to tell you a story where I learned

1390
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,200
everything I need to know about Security

1391
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,180
in the Boy Scouts actually I wasn't

1392
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,160
really a boy scouts Cub Scouts um I was

1393
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,359
eight years old

1394
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,099
and I got a chance to uh got a chance to

1395
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,440
go out in the Appalachian Trail and uh

1396
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,300
my mom she's uh she's awesome she's

1397
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,460
actually a horrible parent but uh on the

1398
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,240
way out

1399
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,500
um now Mom if you're watching this

1400
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,660
you're cool but on the way out

1401
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,460
um you know way out to uh basically the

1402
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,800
car some friends picking me up there our

1403
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,079
friend's mom is picking me up uh and uh

1404
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,140
mom's like have a good time watch out

1405
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,640
for Bears

1406
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,140
don't say that's an eight-year-old kid

1407
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,079
period right watch out for Bears right

1408
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:08,339
turns out there had actually been some

1409
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:09,599
bear activity I grew up backwards

1410
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,800
Virginia there have been some bear

1411
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,180
activity in the Appalachian Trail a

1412
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,740
couple weeks before nearby where we were

1413
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,780
going rocking up near McAfee's knob if

1414
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,920
you're familiar with the Appalachian

1415
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,420
Trail at all I actually don't have to be

1416
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,500
familiar if you've ever seen a photo

1417
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,060
from the Appalachian Trail to McAfee's

1418
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,800
knob all right it's that one picture

1419
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,660
right where it's like all jutted out and

1420
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,040
somebody like sitting over an overhang

1421
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,099
it's super super beautiful place we hike

1422
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,540
up about two-thirds of the way up there

1423
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,920
it's a couple miles and we're all year

1424
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,380
old kids there's 30 40 of us whatever

1425
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,599
and I start a mild Panic

1426
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,040
um you know by talking to my tent mate

1427
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,940
all right so we have those little

1428
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,560
shelter halves you snap together your

1429
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,359
Cub Scout that had that stuff snapping

1430
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,740
these together and

1431
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,240
I'm like hey man my mom said to watch

1432
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,760
out for bears and I was just like

1433
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,520
notifying you know no big deal right he

1434
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,920
starts mad panic and

1435
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,780
creates pandemonium unfortunately in the

1436
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,819
camp and again there's 30 40 kids out

1437
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:58,500
here right it's a picture like 2010s you

1438
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,640
know we're all a bunch of trees around

1439
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,579
and whatnot and uh scoutmaster finally

1440
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,020
like gets the Panic died down a little

1441
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,180
bit he's like don't worry we'll be able

1442
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,280
to find the Bears right I'm like yeah

1443
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,260
okay right so he grabs a couple of the

1444
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,760
cans from the beans that we'd eaten for

1445
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,160
dinner right well had you know hot dogs

1446
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,599
and beans or we all had that experience

1447
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,680
all right if he grabs a couple of those

1448
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,480
cans and he strings up a couple of the

1449
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,280
cans between two of the trees and again

1450
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,660
there's like 20 tents out here right

1451
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,220
dude's strung up maybe like eight feet

1452
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,200
worth of line right and it Taps the line

1453
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,819
he's like Clank Clank Clank Clank and of

1454
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:28,020
course it's right next to our tent right

1455
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,579
because you know that's who caused the

1456
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,500
pandemonium all right and so he's like

1457
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,839
he's like don't worry kids you're good

1458
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,599
if a bear comes into the campground

1459
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,880
they'll hit the string and they'll hear

1460
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,260
the cans

1461
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,280
in my little girl brain was like yeah

1462
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,900
and as I got into security I reflected

1463
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,060
on that a little bit right

1464
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,980
and I recognize that we do a lot of this

1465
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,260
right we had a big perimeter and we

1466
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,300
deployed a point solution and we confuse

1467
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,040
it for a perimeter solution

1468
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,859
because there was a big area with lots

1469
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:01,200
of tents right there were lots of ways

1470
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,819
to bypass that the bear could have for

1471
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,380
instance gone anywhere around or done

1472
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,880
this maneuver

1473
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,700
okay simply stepping over the cans and

1474
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,380
it hit me then that it's not enough to

1475
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,060
Simply string up more cans around the

1476
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,339
perimeter I mean that sounds neat the

1477
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:15,780
the bearer you know if the bear tried to

1478
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,579
step over and then step over again right

1479
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,500
we could have multiple layers like

1480
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,680
defense and depth right or or we could

1481
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,180
actually like validate that our security

1482
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,460
controls work by having I don't know

1483
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,920
like overlapping instead of like you

1484
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,960
know concentric Rings right I want those

1485
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,760
cans the strings of the cans look like

1486
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,260
Tom Cruise and Mission Impossible right

1487
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,520
you know the lasers are just trying to

1488
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,200
like die between the lasers for the

1489
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,880
detection system that kind of stuff

1490
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,460
right and I thought for years I was like

1491
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,200
that's what we need we need lots of cans

1492
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,579
strung up all around so there's no way

1493
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:45,839
to get through it

1494
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,220
and I realized that wasn't enough

1495
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,920
thought about it a little bit more and I

1496
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,780
realized that uh in the majority of

1497
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,520
environments I work in string out cans

1498
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,540
is not enough

1499
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,300
right I String up lots of cans no

1500
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,040
doesn't matter because it's I'm in a

1501
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,839
Metallica concert all the time right

1502
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:03,540
it's like going well I guess Metallica's

1503
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,579
own tunes right but they're heavy metal

1504
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,079
right let's go to the club I want to go

1505
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,240
to a club and said and there's an alarm

1506
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,359
the cans are going off I can't hear them

1507
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:14,760
because my noise floor is too high here

1508
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,079
I'm on the Appalachian Trail I can't

1509
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,180
hear them in my real environment and far

1510
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,859
too often we suck there as well as an

1511
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:22,560
industry right we say oh don't worry see

1512
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,180
it caused an alarm and I'm like well

1513
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,920
you're pointing to it right but will you

1514
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,900
actually see that in a real environment

1515
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,599
right so purple teaming for the win

1516
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,940
there right but basically getting it and

1517
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,500
lowering your noise floor so that you

1518
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,720
know you're going to see a detection

1519
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,880
and then

1520
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,280
yes and then thought a little bit

1521
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,599
further about it so for years I was like

1522
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:43,859
here are the two things I need to know

1523
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:44,940
about security

1524
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,319
and I figured out there was one more

1525
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,480
because as I thought about it a little

1526
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,559
bit more

1527
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,660
I recognize that had a bear come into

1528
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,220
the campground that night we had no

1529
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,319
response plan

1530
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:57,540
yes we were all Little Cub Scouts yes we

1531
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,800
all had knives

1532
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,059
um they were the little pocket knives

1533
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:01,980
the little Swiss army knife that has the

1534
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,660
toothpick in it right I think it's an

1535
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,920
inch and a half blade if I recall

1536
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,540
correctly doesn't lock out we're not

1537
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,980
going to go all Lord of the Flies on

1538
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,839
some Bear right just that wasn't going

1539
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,359
to happen we had no response plan right

1540
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,579
and so as I've thought about this a lot

1541
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:16,380
more it's occurred to me then there are

1542
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,460
three things I need to think about for

1543
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,260
security by the way feel free to steal

1544
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,059
this story this actually did all happen

1545
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:22,800
right the the whole bear thing and then

1546
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,480
strain up cans feel free to steal the

1547
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,800
story and tell it to your Executives

1548
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,359
trust me it resonates with them because

1549
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,339
the vast majority of them are old white

1550
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:32,160
men most of whom were Boy Scouts

1551
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,099
okay and so anyway three things you need

1552
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,420
to remember about security string up

1553
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,280
lots of cans lower the noise floor so

1554
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,359
you can hear the cans and have a

1555
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,040
response plan so you can kill the bear

1556
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,300
and with that I'll open it up for

1557
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,740
questions or I thank you for your time

1558
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,020
and if you have lots of other time go

1559
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,400
jump in the Scythe Workshop or do

1560
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,960
another purple team stuff as well stop

1561
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,059
by the ions desk talk to the folks there

1562
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:54,180
about decision support services and uh

1563
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,740
that's it right

1564
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,480
that's good enough about questions

1565
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,180
questions first Applause will do

1566
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,140
okay that's enough let's have some

1567
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,099
questions

1568
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:10,200
check out that question

1569
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,740
the extraction process

1570
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,480
is it the same team with the same

1571
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,819
motivation or does it change teams and

1572
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:19,079
change motivation

1573
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:20,940
yeah so the question is uh with the

1574
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,680
extortion process for extortion only

1575
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,380
versus double extortion ransomware uh is

1576
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,940
it the same team and just a different

1577
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,880
process or a different teams right it's

1578
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,380
actually different teams

1579
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,359
um so the the majority of the folks that

1580
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,740
are doing double extortion they're just

1581
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,420
following a Playbook they can't read

1582
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,760
they can't read English they're not uh

1583
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,780
you know again they don't understand

1584
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,760
what they're targeting they're running a

1585
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,020
tool they're literally following a

1586
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,240
script and we we've long suspected this

1587
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,880
but we've seen enough dumps now from you

1588
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,619
know from from some leaks right enough

1589
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,960
enough data to show us that indeed you

1590
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,980
know these folks don't really know what

1591
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,240
they're doing on the extortion side for

1592
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,859
the stuff they're actual trading on the

1593
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:57,839
extortion only operations you know and

1594
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,339
again even negotiating with these folks

1595
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:00,839
that they have a clear command of the

1596
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:02,160
English language

1597
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,380
um and uh or Target language in general

1598
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,240
usually English right they have a clear

1599
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,500
command of the language they have a

1600
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,700
clear understanding what they're going

1601
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,240
after and how to maximize the damage

1602
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,000
um from the data that they're taking so

1603
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,220
that's a fantastic question sir

1604
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,760
oh that's fantastic so the question was

1605
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,040
I mentioned x86 Powershell as being bad

1606
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,260
first off and what's the what's the best

1607
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,760
way to address that in an environment or

1608
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,960
simple way to address that in an

1609
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,859
environment

1610
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:36,180
um first off I should I should mention

1611
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,700
all x86 Powershell is not necessarily

1612
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,740
bad but it is it is definitely something

1613
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,819
you should be paying attention to

1614
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,760
Powershell itself executes a lot on

1615
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,800
Modern Windows if you go back and look

1616
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,500
though 99 Point whatever percent of our

1617
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,900
normal Powershell executions are and

1618
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,000
it's like 99.9 some odd percent of most

1619
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,480
Windows systems they're x64 right so the

1620
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,460
x86 Powershell a couple of things that I

1621
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,020
look for

1622
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,460
um definitely one of them is just turn

1623
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,680
on sysmon right if you turn on sysmon

1624
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,720
and you are you you can the great thing

1625
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,819
with sysmon is you can turn on and

1626
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:11,099
filter against specific processes and

1627
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:12,839
then if I if I combine that with Windows

1628
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:14,520
Event forwarding this is by the way is a

1629
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,839
completely free solution at this point

1630
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,760
mine is a Windows Event forwarding then

1631
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,280
I can forward only those events that are

1632
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,559
x86 Powershell right and I'm getting the

1633
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,960
parent process for that as well as I can

1634
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,420
then also filter on sysmon as the child

1635
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,760
processes as well so what is Powershell

1636
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,559
doing if it's calling other processes

1637
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,720
I'm probably interested in those two so

1638
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,359
cismon's the cheapish way to do it right

1639
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,099
off the bat since we're on x86

1640
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:40,020
Powershell we already talked about CIS

1641
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,240
while 64 and we we talked a little about

1642
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,099
system 32 there's one more called CIS

1643
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:45,660
native right if you're not familiar with

1644
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,119
CIS native go look that up all right

1645
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,099
there's one other directory there you

1646
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:51,839
won't see it go look it up I don't have

1647
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,099
time to talk about it here but it is

1648
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:53,940
something you should definitely pay

1649
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,559
attention to because if you see anything

1650
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,140
next to you know Assist native that is a

1651
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,420
like 99 it's it's kind of like you know

1652
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,880
seeing you know seeing some some guy

1653
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,200
walk in with you know like giant

1654
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,880
teardrop tattoos he's holding the gun

1655
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,040
and whatever he may be here and not here

1656
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,300
to do anything horrible but like

1657
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,859
probably not right

1658
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:12,359
um so the reality is we should probably

1659
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:16,700
take uh take action against that so

1660
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:19,800
thanks Jake thank you

1661
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,319
we have there's one comment from from

1662
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,720
Discord somebody wants a hug because

1663
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,940
because you have scared them somebody

1664
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,380
wants a hug because I scare them that's

1665
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,839
awesome mental health you affected

1666
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:32,180
mental health

1667
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,200
I didn't mean to scare anybody everybody

1668
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,260
hug each other you know maybe next time

1669
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,599
