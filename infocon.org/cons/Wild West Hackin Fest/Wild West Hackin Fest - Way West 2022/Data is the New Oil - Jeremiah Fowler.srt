1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,100
all right Jeremiah

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,560
take it away sir all right thank you

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,800
guys ladies and gentlemen attending I

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,240
haven't been this nervous since I won

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,219
the state yodeling Championship a couple

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,740
years back it was a good time

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,480
um it's kind of intimidating to be up

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,279
here after all the knowledge and and

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,199
facts of some of the Wizards I've seen

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,580
up here

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,960
um so that's pretty cool it's

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,380
inspirational to to learn uh many

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,519
different things as a security

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,180
researcher I'm a data Hunter so I'm not

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,820
you know on the wizard level I'm the guy

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,300
who finds stuff analyzes what it is and

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,040
then tries to identify how it can be

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,440
exploited

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,660
um my first slide here says everything

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,000
we all kind of know that data is the new

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,059
oil it's valuable for many reasons and

22
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,100
lots of people want it

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,899
I have an interesting story that we'll

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,420
get into so my first few slides you'll

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,699
see uh are kind of like building up who

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,180
I am and how I got into Tech

27
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,099
so this is about me uh 10 years in

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,520
technology and the big thing is I got my

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,680
start as a security researcher through a

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,619
data breach which yeah I mean that was a

31
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,439
very painful lesson luckily it wasn't my

32
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,420
fault I was the communications director

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,180
and PR director

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,520
but what is really cool is how much I

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,740
learned from that about data protection

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,080
we had to learn the hard way

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,979
so my start in Tech was uh Myspace

38
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,619
I was a glitter text expert you know I

39
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,960
could copy and paste like a boss put in

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,240
my embedded players top eight friends

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,100
highly valued status of course I was

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,780
friends with Tom that also put me high

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,240
up on the list and I've violated

44
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,079
Community standards often

45
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,820
in a previous lifetime I was a

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,259
professional musician that's actually

47
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,960
real pictures of one of my concerts so

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
we got a record deal sounded like the

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,259
dream thought it was going to be rocking

50
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,280
stages Napster said no so Napster let

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,560
people share music for free from

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,420
computer to computer and a record

53
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,280
company didn't make any money and sent

54
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,120
us packing so after that I became a real

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,360
estate agent and financial advisor after

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
my music days I was voted most likely to

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,940
look Dazed and Confused and probably was

58
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,760
in 2004 I could have got your dog or a

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,400
cat a hundred percent loan and probably

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,500
a home equity line of credit with no

61
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,760
documents

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,540
2007 I didn't have a job and not only

63
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,040
did I not have a job but I literally

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,580
lost everything like I lost my uh all my

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,700
stocks you know boat all that fun stuff

66
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,220
I didn't need so had to start over from

67
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,400
the bottom which wasn't easy the girl I

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,260
was dating at the time was from Eastern

69
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,280
Europe

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
and uh we all know

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,959
that the women from Eastern Europe are

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,300
usually not attractive so uh it was a

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,040
real struggle to talk with her I asked

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,420
her where her accent was from she told

75
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,660
me Ukraine yes that Ukraine

76
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,580
um and I said Canada so she said you're

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,080
either an idiot or really funny I'm not

78
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,519
sure which

79
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,280
so during the subprime crisis everything

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,980
crashed I lost everything and we decided

81
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,159
to move to Ukraine so for the last 10

82
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,060
years I've called Kiev home and it's

83
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,159
been an amazing place

84
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,879
it's it was a technology Hub and many

85
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,340
companies would Outsource there because

86
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,980
when the Soviet Union collapsed there

87
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,300
were many industries that people

88
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,760
couldn't get in a lot of young people uh

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
you couldn't do medical you couldn't do

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,819
agriculture you couldn't do

91
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,700
pharmaceutical because those were taken

92
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,480
by the oligarchs the mafia so young

93
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,220
people became really educated they

94
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,040
became really smart they understood that

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,080
digital currency was the way to make a

96
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
very good living that didn't depend on

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
oligarchs or or the government or

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,019
instability so there was a huge Tech

99
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,120
sector there

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,360
um this is me during the 2014 revolution

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,420
of dignity I was there as you can see it

102
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,360
was pretty pretty crazy

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,120
that's me after one of the battles uh in

104
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,860
the morning that's the soccer stadium

105
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,418
and then on February 24th at five in the

106
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,060
morning I get a phone call and I play

107
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,220
jokes and make prank phone calls and and

108
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,620
I have a terrible sense of humor and one

109
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,759
of my friends was like Hey the war

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
started you have to go and I'm like

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
you're such an [ __ ] and so I hang up

112
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
the phone the phone rings again and I'm

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,880
like man I hate these guys and so sure

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,699
enough I hear Air Raid Sirens scoop my

115
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,880
kid up and we haul ass on the way

116
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,160
outside of Kiev this is what we see we

117
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,500
saw one of the airports actually blown

118
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,440
up by Russian attack helicopters and

119
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,880
then you know it was a terrible feeling

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,620
to have to look up in the sky and see a

121
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,080
bird and be like okay that's a MIG you

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,440
know uh so then we drove to the Polish

123
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,780
border that's uh that's my SuperStar Kid

124
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,699
enjoying herself not realizing she's a

125
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,360
refugee yet

126
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,780
so four days uh standing in line and it

127
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,000
really was you know it was it was it was

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,940
heartbreaking in one respect but it was

129
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,740
you know we're blessed to have this

130
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,139
passport that many of these people don't

131
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,820
you know I'm blessed to be able to work

132
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,039
remotely and and to work anywhere that I

133
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,560
have a computer and and internet but it

134
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,440
was heartbreaking to see this and

135
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,479
you know this is this was the view every

136
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,979
store was empty you would see little

137
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,660
children like walking for miles and

138
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,620
miles

139
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,000
um so that was hard that was really

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,100
difficult and

141
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,039
you know I know as interesting as war

142
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,139
and revolution is we're here to talk

143
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,880
about the real stuff technology so

144
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,979
as you know we're here to talk about

145
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,780
tech now

146
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,840
when I first started this uh when we had

147
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,820
talked about me speaking it was going to

148
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,419
be on iot and data breaches and things

149
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,340
kind of went South as you could see in

150
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,419
my life

151
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,880
um so we moved to Poland we lived in

152
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,860
Poland for a month I'm originally from

153
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,960
Virginia which is Banjo country right on

154
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,639
the border

155
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,639
um now I've decided to change it based

156
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,340
on what happened so

157
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,620
I'll go back and say how I got started

158
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,919
with the data breach that'll give you

159
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,220
possibly a pla a path or an idea if you

160
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,220
have a data breach of how we handled it

161
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,740
so uh doc gave a presentation the other

162
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,020
night and it said never let a good uh

163
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,680
let a data breach go to waste so I was a

164
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,900
communications director and the security

165
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,240
researcher found a massive amount of our

166
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,840
customer records and you know everyone

167
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,819
hated our company because we advertised

168
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,220
so heavily we had around 90 million ad

169
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,319
Impressions per month so people were

170
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,060
like you guys are spammers we hate you

171
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,280
and of course we advertised on all the

172
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,560
worst channels you know like the the

173
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,319
porn the gambling

174
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,280
all the places you don't want to be

175
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,020
that's where we were so everyone hated

176
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,259
us and immediately

177
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,180
what I did was I reached out to the

178
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,759
security researcher and I said thank you

179
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,440
which that's rare as a security

180
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,360
researcher I never hear that usually

181
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,000
it's like I hate you why did you hack us

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,979
um so I said thank you you know this

183
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,479
means so much to us you found this

184
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,539
vulnerability we'd like to hire you and

185
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,240
he was shocked so the owners of the

186
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,979
company basically gave me a blank check

187
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,280
I hired the security researcher awesome

188
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,380
guy I learned so much from him and then

189
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,539
we created a research center inside of

190
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,699
that company to find out how data

191
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,280
breaches happen where that data is and

192
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,800
how we can help prevent data exposures

193
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,440
then the company went very corporate

194
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,780
they hired some guys from some top U.S

195
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,300
security companies and they said how

196
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,919
much money do you make what's your

197
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,419
revenue and I'm like we're helping

198
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,259
people

199
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,479
and they said no what's your Roi and I'm

200
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,720
like help and then they they closed us

201
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,520
down the following month

202
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,819
so they closed that department down my

203
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,880
partner and friend Bob diacenko uh we

204
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,979
started security discovery

205
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,960
because we enjoyed it it was treasure

206
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,000
hunting for for Big Boys you know and it

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,819
was really fun we were finding large

208
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,919
amounts of data I mean we were finding

209
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,560
millions of credit card numbers uh

210
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,020
passports IDs medical records but iot is

211
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,559
any connected device and there's so much

212
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,219
information that's out there and that

213
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,020
information has to be stored somewhere

214
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,020
once it's collected so in the process of

215
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,560
storage you increase the chances of a

216
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,740
data breach astronomically

217
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,019
so I'm not going to go into too many of

218
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,240
the details you can look at this we all

219
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
know how many data breaches happen I

220
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
mean every day it's almost like a breach

221
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,839
another breach a bigger breach but this

222
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,760
is just kind of to tell you that nearly

223
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,680
60 percent of businesses had a data

224
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,540
breach in the past three years and

225
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,519
statistically once they've had a breach

226
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,560
they won't have another one because now

227
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,500
they're focused on a data breach and

228
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,680
data security and unfortunately that's

229
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,339
usually when they will invest in cyber

230
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,459
security is after an incident and I

231
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,320
always make the joke you know if a

232
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,700
company tells us you know hey we don't

233
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,320
have a bug Bounty and I'm like well no

234
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,180
one does until they do and it's usually

235
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,220
after a day to breach

236
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,740
so this is security Discovery in the

237
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,160
news these are some of our findings

238
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,100
um this railway station provider we've

239
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,339
all given our data for free Wi-Fi right

240
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,899
and so these guys collected everything

241
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,019
including your your your sex your date

242
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,779
of birth your email address that's pii

243
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,880
you know once you get to a lot of email

244
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,339
formats are your first and last name and

245
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,500
what's funny is when I I contacted them

246
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,240
they they got back with me and were

247
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,040
basically like eat a sausage you know

248
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,180
that was their response and they had

249
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,820
shared this data of like many many many

250
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,680
customers who use the London Railway

251
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,320
system and I always make the joke that

252
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,180
it's all fun and games until the BBC

253
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,459
asks you for comment

254
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,100
but uh and you can see we found

255
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,000
Microsoft Facebook a lot of a lot of big

256
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,620
data over the last couple years I've

257
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,480
just I'm almost immune to how much data

258
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,980
I've seen

259
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,920
um so we found voter databases millions

260
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,200
of medical records and medical records

261
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,760
actually are valuable because on the

262
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,320
dark web they sell for as high as a

263
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,000
thousand dollars you can blackmail

264
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,459
people with them millions of credit card

265
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,279
numbers uh found the terrorist watch

266
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,980
list a few times that was interesting

267
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,399
we actually worked with Interpol to help

268
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,339
bring down a Spam cartel and it's

269
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,440
interesting that even the bad guys can

270
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,540
have a data breach so that was really

271
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,339
wild to see what was inside that

272
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,560
database and you know we turned it over

273
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,300
to the authorities and and they were

274
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,220
able to track down who it was and take

275
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,019
them down

276
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,820
now this is one of the biggest things

277
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,620
because I believe in responsible

278
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,839
disclosure and not throwing anyone under

279
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,339
the bus for doing the right thing and

280
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,440
what I mean by that is companies who

281
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,420
protect their users data and their

282
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,300
customers data and have an accident

283
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,660
accidents happen companies who

284
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,700
collect data leak data and then they're

285
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,860
like not not a problem you know that's

286
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,779
that's when you have a responsibility

287
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,060
because these are real people

288
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,160
this is real data you know if your

289
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,220
customer ever has a identity theft issue

290
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,019
that's a nightmare you know that this

291
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,579
real person is going to have to overcome

292
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,620
for years and years and years but I hear

293
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,180
all the time that everything's a test

294
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,380
server

295
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,200
it's all dummy data and and in the past

296
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,480
I have actually found my own information

297
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,440
in a dummy server and uh that didn't go

298
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,839
over well so here was a finding I had

299
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,000
recently I found a billion health

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,399
records or a billion records that belong

301
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,959
to CVS health

302
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,920
and through further analysis this was

303
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,959
not all of their customers this was

304
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,360
actually their search bar on their

305
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,260
website

306
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,140
and so when I contacted them they were

307
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,120
like yeah it's our search bar good luck

308
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,500
you know thanks thanks for letting us

309
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,700
know and I'm like what about all the

310
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,380
email addresses and they're like what

311
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,459
are you talking about this is a search

312
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,279
bar there was a design flaw on the

313
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,019
mobile app where the login and the

314
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,480
search bar were right beside each other

315
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,399
so there was so many email addresses

316
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,899
where people thought that they were

317
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,220
logging into their account and they were

318
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,240
putting their email in the search bar

319
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,279
and then it was captured in this

320
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,000
database and then I could

321
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,279
cross-reference that

322
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,980
and actually see what they searched for

323
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,079
you know because they had a unique user

324
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,760
so I could see if they were searching

325
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,620
for herpes medicine if they were

326
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,200
searching for covid medicine and that

327
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,240
puts them in a very tricky situation

328
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,360
because as we were saying most emails

329
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,339
you can you can find out who a person is

330
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,440
usually through their email

331
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,420
so that put them at risk for being

332
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,399
extorted and of course CVS did the right

333
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,420
thing

334
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,519
notified their customers but it was it

335
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,380
was an interesting find because they

336
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,940
thought it was nothing and I found

337
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,740
something in it

338
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,620
you know we all think about data being

339
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,899
valuable or not valuable of course

340
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,760
everyone in this room knows data is

341
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
valuable and there's many different ways

342
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,700
we give our data for free for a service

343
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,459
such as Facebook or or you know YouTube

344
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,500
has almost become an assault now with

345
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,959
how many ads they force on you

346
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,779
um but we're trading our personal

347
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,760
information to be able to use those

348
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,880
services and then we don't know how long

349
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,639
that information will be used and what

350
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,860
it'll be used for so once it's collected

351
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,899
it's gone it's out in space and and

352
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,420
they'll have a profile on us forever

353
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,579
during the pandemic when people work

354
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,820
from home we saw a tidal wave of data

355
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,220
breaches where companies and

356
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,740
organizations would open up remote

357
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,980
access and it was open for everyone and

358
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,959
people like me would find it bad guys

359
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,720
would find it cyber criminals would find

360
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,040
it

361
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,980
I love this because you know in all the

362
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,220
things you can do human error is still

363
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,620
the one thing that we can't overcome

364
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,260
extra steps for security nobody likes it

365
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,180
it's not convenient it's complete pain

366
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,760
in the ass to have to go through even

367
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,139
when I have to do two-factor

368
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,420
verification I preach a small sermon of

369
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,800
curse words

370
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,139
and this is just you know the statistics

371
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,760
we all know that everything is

372
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,440
vulnerable and because we know

373
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,300
everything is vulnerable sometimes we

374
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,180
get a little lacks we really need to

375
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,060
focus on just how vulnerable systems are

376
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,459
and that includes patch management

377
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,620
making sure your software is up to date

378
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,360
we all know that but this is something

379
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,639
that you need to preach to senior

380
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,880
Executives a lot of c-level guys live in

381
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,380
a different planet they're like yeah

382
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,019
yeah whatever what's the revenue they

383
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,180
don't realize that revenue is tied to

384
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,579
security a data breach is you know it

385
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,220
can really destroy a company not just

386
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,920
financially but the reputation value of

387
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,260
a data breach is something that's very

388
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,540
hard to to recover from

389
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,880
and another thing to remember is with

390
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,940
iot is nearly half of connected devices

391
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,240
are outdated and that's a breakdown you

392
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,279
know from industry

393
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,260
and a lot of you know even medical

394
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,660
equipment is running like Windows 95 or

395
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,760
something you know so these companies

396
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,160
will make an iot device that was never

397
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
meant to be maintained or have a

398
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,480
security feature and then when that

399
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,240
operating system from that iot device is

400
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,540
no longer functional it's just waiting

401
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,760
to be attacked or

402
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,220
or taken out so let's take a look at

403
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,899
some exposed data this is the kind of

404
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,839
stuff I find and search for

405
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,940
um always love looking at remote

406
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,920
desktops those are nice to see what

407
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,300
people are doing

408
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,699
here's an example of webcams you know

409
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,339
you can literally just search the end of

410
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,680
the world watching webcams if you have

411
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,899
that kind of time

412
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,899
so this is I'm showing showdan which is

413
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,820
an iot search engine there are many many

414
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
of them now but um this is what it looks

415
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,440
like when you see you know there it's

416
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,320
like [ __ ] database you can see that's

417
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,420
what a publicly exposed elastic looks

418
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,959
like there's 20 gigs 28 gigs 23 gigs now

419
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,000
here's a Jenkins you can see there's

420
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,339
access keys there for an AWS account

421
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,139
secret keys

422
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,259
so once that's exposed you could

423
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,180
literally go into that person's AWS

424
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,920
account you have the keys you can unlock

425
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,120
the door

426
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,980
there's a another one with some secret

427
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,240
keys

428
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,940
and usually if something's exposed for

429
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,980
very long you see these automated

430
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,079
ransomware messages everywhere in them

431
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,899
and those are put in sometimes the data

432
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,720
will be wiped out or encrypted

433
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,740
so this is the market size of data what

434
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,619
it's projected to be in 2030 and I

435
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,119
always tell people that you know

436
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,660
customer data is just as important of

437
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,939
whatever service you or product you're

438
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,880
selling because that data is valuable

439
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,119
there are data protection laws now like

440
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,439
gdpr California has one when there is a

441
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,599
federal data Protection Law there will

442
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,419
be a financial penalty for people who

443
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:31,919
violate that or companies that that

444
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,980
violate that so not only is it you know

445
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,900
important to focus on cyber security

446
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,419
there will be a financial penalty one

447
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,539
day down the road for not complying and

448
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,340
that's an estimate of the average cost

449
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,460
of a data breach it can be as high as 8

450
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,860
million uh usually it hovers around four

451
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,860
but you really cannot estimate or judge

452
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,740
what that cost is when you look at

453
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,799
losing customers losing trust you know

454
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,260
the uh if there is any fines for example

455
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,080
if you have to provide credit monitoring

456
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,360
for two years three years it's an

457
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,700
astronomical figure now we'll talk about

458
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,919
hacked data a little bit because that's

459
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,900
very different than what what I find is

460
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,480
misconfigured data I find data where the

461
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,780
door is left open front or back and hack

462
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,299
data is a little different

463
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,059
the thing with hack data the same as

464
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,580
exposed data is they're looking for

465
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,980
information that they can dig deeper

466
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,700
into the network or find keys that go to

467
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,220
other systems content management and I

468
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,720
never see those because as a security

469
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,179
researcher even if I see passwords we

470
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:40,620
don't use them

471
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,539
I see them all the time I just don't use

472
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,400
them so I don't know what's behind the

473
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,120
door

474
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,260
so taking it back to my Refugee life we

475
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,020
drove to Poland here we are in Poland I

476
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,880
have no idea what's going on I left my

477
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,760
home with two pair of pants two shirts

478
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,059
and a very very suspicious amount of

479
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,900
hard drives but

480
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,460
so luckily they weren't checking real

481
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,520
well at the border but so I spent my

482
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,100
birthday there and I

483
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,140
finally was like okay I need to get back

484
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,179
to work I need to reach out to some

485
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,600
clients get my life back on track and I

486
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,880
reached out to a friend who works for

487
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,400
Forbes and I had been working on a

488
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,760
report I found a giant database of fox

489
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,720
broadcasting and all their emails like

490
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,760
Discovery emails Disney emails they were

491
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,640
all there which is perfect harvesting

492
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,460
ground for a targeted phishing attack so

493
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,700
uh message them they were like yeah

494
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,520
whatever thanks testing something they

495
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,780
didn't tell me it was testing but they

496
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,160
did say it was like development and I'm

497
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,900
like well these are real email addresses

498
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,419
I've validated them and then also many

499
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,000
testing environment environments mirror

500
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,140
a production environment because

501
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,120
it still shows where the files are

502
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,980
stored it still shows the structure it

503
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,600
still shows the middleware so a lot of

504
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
times they mirror each other so you know

505
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,460
when you say it's just a development

506
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,320
environment no it's still a window into

507
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,480
your network it still a potential back

508
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,720
door so I contacted my friend at Forbes

509
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,360
and I said hey let's print this story

510
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,059
about Fox News and he says

511
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,740
no

512
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,100
everything right now is Ukraine Ukraine

513
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,260
and Russia and he said I'm sorry man I

514
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,760
can't print this he was like my editor

515
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,240
won't approve it and I really sat there

516
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,559
and I was like wow I had worked on this

517
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,760
report for like a month and I'm like

518
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,280
what world do we live in when a Fox News

519
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,799
or you know a fox broadcasting breach is

520
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,740
is not some kind of fifth page last page

521
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,059
news

522
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,640
so then he said everything right now

523
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,559
he's Russia in Ukraine

524
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,480
and I had no idea what I was going to do

525
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,160
so I

526
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,980
read the Twitter sometimes and on the

527
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,720
Twitter the anonymous had announced that

528
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,299
they had declared uh cyber war against

529
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,360
Russia and all of the media Outlets

530
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,320
started writing stories about this using

531
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,160
no evidence just a Twitter post

532
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,059
and media wouldn't do that uh so I I got

533
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,559
the idea to research Anonymous and so

534
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,539
there was no evidence of their claims

535
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,660
and I've always avoided uh I've always

536
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,160
avoided Russian data uh

537
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,340
um so I understand Russian but always

538
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,380
avoided Russian data so I got the idea

539
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,720
to look at a hundred exposed Russian

540
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,299
databases and see what was in them and

541
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,100
then I wanted to provide reference to

542
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,240
what I found

543
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,580
and I was shocked 92 out of 100 had been

544
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,400
accessed or vandalized the files were

545
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,580
removed or renamed and many of them were

546
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,980
wiped out and the files were renamed to

547
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,039
like I'll show you Putin stopped this

548
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,820
war glory to Ukraine and there was a

549
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,460
malicious script called meowbot like two

550
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,440
years ago that just went in and if if

551
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,780
your permissions were were full admin it

552
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,700
would wipe you out

553
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,740
so here's what some of the databases

554
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,960
look like you know this this would come

555
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,520
in and it would delete everything and re

556
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,700
rename the file to Putin stop this war

557
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,039
and then I found a massive amount of

558
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,539
Russian data so in this one there's 272

559
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:37,559
000 names addresses email addresses of

560
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,620
Russian customers then here's secret

561
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,679
Keys here's information and you can see

562
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,640
that the indices have all been renamed

563
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,440
so my report

564
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,500
took off went well and then I got quoted

565
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,659
by Anonymous on the Twitter and I was

566
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,799
like oh [ __ ] like that was that really

567
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,720
was like my first response I was like

568
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,600
this is how it ends

569
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
um luckily nothing happened you know I

570
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,700
didn't become a Target because I I do

571
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,620
try to remain neutral even though I'm

572
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,360
biased

573
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,179
um so it was very good that I was

574
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,820
referenced as a source because then you

575
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,280
know a lot of media reached out to me uh

576
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,600
because I did have a knowledge of

577
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,840
Ukraine and I also have a bit of cyber

578
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,760
knowledge and then I could analyze what

579
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,640
was going on or validate some of what

580
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,100
anonymous had claimed

581
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,559
this is a little timeline of what

582
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,200
anonymous had had done you know since

583
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,500
the start of the war on the 24th so when

584
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,440
I started researching I fell in right

585
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,480
here at number four

586
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,980
so that was

587
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,860
um in the timeline

588
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,299
and I'm not going to go through these

589
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,460
individually because it changes every

590
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,919
day but they have dumped terabytes and

591
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,200
terabytes of data I mean just such a

592
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,200
massive amount of data and the value of

593
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,780
of them dumping this data is you're

594
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,200
going to be able to look and see which

595
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,659
bank violated sanctions you know which

596
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,659
illegal deals may have been done so from

597
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,360
a cyber or I'm sorry from a forensic

598
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,840
historical standpoint I think people

599
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,580
will be crawling through this data for

600
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,440
years and and there's many years worth

601
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,320
of this data so Anonymous changed the

602
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,200
rules of cyber warfare

603
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,620
um they really have because you know for

604
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,179
one there's no leadership there's no

605
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,280
borders there's no country that you can

606
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,640
point at to fight back against and you

607
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,720
know when when you're watching

608
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,220
television and you see a maternity

609
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,960
hospital blown up

610
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
people are tired of waiting for the

611
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,179
United Nations to be very concerned you

612
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,919
know it's like you look at what happened

613
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,580
in Syria they were very concerned and so

614
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,520
when you see atrocities and you feel

615
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,080
like there's something you can do on

616
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,840
your computer right now it's easy to see

617
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,539
how hacktivism and

618
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,900
and and you know reacting the way that

619
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,880
people do that's why so many people have

620
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,799
joined anonymous

621
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,500
and here's some of the ways that

622
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,080
that they're actually attacking Russian

623
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,140
assets uh hijacking Russian servers to

624
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,720
attack other Russian servers

625
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,760
they hacked printers

626
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,120
because the censorship in Russia is very

627
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,100
severe even passed a law that if you

628
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,860
mention anything about the war and

629
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,779
someone deems it to be false news then

630
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,900
you go to jail for 10 or 15 years so

631
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,360
there were hacking printers imagine

632
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,980
you're sitting in your living room your

633
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,360
printer kicks on you're like what the

634
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,419
hell is that that's news and then you

635
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,779
can read actual uh news out of Ukraine

636
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,480
or you know proof points that may not

637
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,700
pass censorship and they also did the

638
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,159
same with barcode printers in grocery

639
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,320
stores so you go to weigh your bananas

640
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,480
and it's like all zeros and says glory

641
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,120
to Ukraine

642
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,620
so these are some of the most creative

643
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,539
out of the box ways we all know doesn't

644
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,580
denial of service attacks and hacking

645
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,340
that's traditional Anonymous Style

646
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,200
but even

647
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,440
allowing normal people anyone can go to

648
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,779
that website and send text messages to

649
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,419
Russian citizens they can email they can

650
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,820
phone call if they speak the language or

651
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,100
they can just sing songs or yell

652
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,460
another uh interesting leak was the FSB

653
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,460
agent data was leaked and this also

654
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,159
included their SIM card and IMEI number

655
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,799
of their phones so theoretically you

656
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,360
could clone their Sim put it in your

657
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,220
phone get on telegram read some messages

658
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,140
stuff like that

659
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,779
um so this is huge you know when we

660
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,400
think about Anonymous we usually think

661
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,400
about just disrupting but this is a

662
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,340
legit full-on attack against the you

663
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,980
know the Russian everything Russian and

664
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,539
it's interesting that

665
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,820
they almost have a free pass as this

666
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,520
Robin Hood now but we have to remember

667
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,299
that cyber hacktivism now can come back

668
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,799
and bite us later

669
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,440
and this is another interesting thing

670
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,779
that they did not only did they target

671
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,240
the Russian government but they targeted

672
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,520
companies who still do business in

673
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,799
Russia and many companies just like I

674
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,159
said there put profits over morals and

675
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,220
you know if it comes down to getting all

676
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,380
of your internal information your

677
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,480
marketing data your sales data your

678
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,940
Revenue leaked online or getting out

679
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,400
many people choose to get out

680
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,340
so they're adding additional pressure on

681
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,159
top of the moral pressure for companies

682
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,299
hopefully none of you have ever seen

683
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,059
this this is a ransomware screen if you

684
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:48,480
see that chances are you're in deep [ __ ]

685
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,220
but what's interesting is Hackers

686
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,260
actually uh got in and got Conti's code

687
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,000
and changed it and are now using it on

688
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,059
the Russians and the Bitcoin address is

689
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,740
actually to the Ukrainian government so

690
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,960
if you pay the ransom it goes back to

691
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,760
the Ukrainian government

692
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,220
um so after they pledge allegiance to

693
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,020
Russia their data was leaked so we don't

694
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,240
know if that was a coincidence a Insider

695
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,039
attack or if that really truly was

696
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,120
anonymous

697
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,760
so how big is anonymous we have no idea

698
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,659
a Twitter account the uranon news also

699
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,020
quoted me uh they have eight million

700
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,960
followers and there's over 320 000

701
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,659
digital volunteers on the I.T Army of

702
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,059
Ukraine and that's another thing that I

703
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,220
said earlier about how Ukraine was this

704
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,980
outsourced Hub people you know it is

705
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,140
cool there to be an I.T person it is

706
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,900
cool to know Tech I mean over there if

707
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,820
you see a pretty girl her boyfriend is

708
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,440
The Tech Guy because he's the one that's

709
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,620
making good money he's not the rock star

710
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,840
but because they have this technology

711
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,580
they speak the language they understand

712
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,120
the language when it comes to a cyber

713
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,080
Army they're very capable and then you

714
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,179
add in the tool sets of all the other

715
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,039
people who are joining them

716
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,440
and you really have a very capable cyber

717
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,799
Army so the danger of hacktivism and I'm

718
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,360
just highlighting things that Anonymous

719
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,980
has done I'm not up here promoting

720
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,120
anything

721
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,159
um it was just something that at the

722
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,720
right time in the right place I did

723
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,299
research that was valuable to news

724
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:24,240
agencies uh and validated their claims

725
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,980
so

726
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,740
so many people joining Anonymous right

727
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,960
now or the umbrella groups or splinter

728
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,779
groups there's different skill sets that

729
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,940
they're bringing to the table and

730
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,620
they're doing things that they've never

731
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,600
done before or anyone's ever done before

732
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,120
in a cyber War their training recruits

733
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,840
they're offering uh cyber security and

734
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,880
like pen testing for Ukrainian assets

735
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,919
and then warning the ukrainians of their

736
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,020
findings before the Russians can

737
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,020
actually you know get into their data

738
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,000
get into their cameras

739
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,460
so it's

740
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,460
really important to remember although we

741
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,799
cheer Anonymous now I say we probably

742
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,279
not us but many people do

743
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,440
they're learning tools and techniques

744
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,539
that we might have to fight against down

745
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,820
the road what happens when the Ukraine

746
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,220
Russia conflict is over and they attack

747
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,860
your company or they attack your bank or

748
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,140
they attack your country or other nation

749
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,440
states so it's one thing as we watch

750
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,460
this

751
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,059
keep in mind that we're literally

752
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,700
making the plan now of how we will

753
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,340
defend against future Cyber Wars

754
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,220
and then think about where is the

755
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,559
Russian cyber War when we put sanctions

756
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,840
on them we all expected Russia would

757
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,179
just attack Bank of America and they

758
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,039
would attack the Pentagon and they would

759
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,440
you know create this massive disruption

760
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,100
and they didn't so why that's the real

761
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,120
question usually before any incursion

762
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,520
Russia has always used some sort of

763
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,620
cyber weapons and they have used them

764
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,020
against Ukraine in the beginning and

765
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,399
Ukraine has actually been their testing

766
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,320
ground they've knocked down their grid a

767
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,960
few times uh infected their government

768
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,919
website servers this is uh in Ukrainian

769
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,140
and it basically says we've gotten all

770
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,840
of your data expect the worst and this

771
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,580
was put on the ministry of Defense

772
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,799
website

773
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,840
National Bank a couple other websites so

774
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,320
Russia did this uh just before the war

775
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,539
this was sometime in March

776
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,419
so Russia's cyber capabilities are they

777
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:34,860
overestimated

778
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,779
I mean have we really overestimated

779
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,659
Russia's value in the cyber community

780
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,600
the same way that we all overestimated

781
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,059
their capabilities uh fighting a ground

782
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,940
war or is this strategic that they're

783
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,940
actually concerned because the global

784
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,460
Community United in a way that nobody

785
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,120
expected clearly Mr Vladimir Putin did

786
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,320
not expect

787
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,360
so we have to think of the future of

788
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,260
Security based on the past of security

789
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,380
and I'm focused on Cyber uh Warfare now

790
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,120
because it's something that I'm now

791
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,580
eating drinking breathing and sleeping

792
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,500
with and

793
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,659
it scares me it should scare everyone

794
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,059
because it's different if you know a

795
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,580
group of guys just hack you but it's

796
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,580
very different if actors from all around

797
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,279
the world many of whom can't be found

798
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,720
they're called Anonymous for a reason

799
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,960
and look at how few of them have

800
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,820
actually ever been caught arrested and

801
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,559
tried they're very good at remaining

802
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,659
Anonymous so if a group like that

803
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,299
targets you you really will have a hard

804
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,460
time defending and with all of the out

805
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,260
of the box methodology that they're

806
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,840
using it really changes the game on

807
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,299
cyber warfare so think about cyber

808
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,760
defense attacks will never fully stop

809
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,039
Insider threats can never be eliminated

810
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,020
because you have to give your employees

811
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,240
access you can't block everybody from

812
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,220
everything just because you want to stay

813
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,120
safe

814
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,919
the only thing you can really do is

815
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,779
protect data infrastructure from

816
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,179
internal and external threats change the

817
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,220
security culture internally and what I

818
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,700
mean by change the culture internally is

819
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,220
make sure everyone understands that they

820
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,460
are responsible for data protection when

821
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,860
you change the culture it's not just

822
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,600
some [ __ ] coming and going that we

823
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,580
got a new policy everybody sign it by

824
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,419
Monday

825
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,919
that's usually what happens and

826
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,899
everybody's like God I hate that guy and

827
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,159
then they sign it and they forget

828
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,740
everything because that's how we're just

829
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,360
so tired of it

830
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,740
um but when you change the culture and

831
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,659
when I say change the culture we you

832
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,820
know we we make it fun you know instead

833
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,380
of shaming someone for opening a

834
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,260
phishing email you know have fun with it

835
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,059
um you can you can really change the

836
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,700
culture of security and that's important

837
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,240
because many data breaches happen from

838
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,480
Top Executives who are not technical but

839
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,980
they have access to everything when they

840
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,080
shouldn't

841
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,600
and HR people they're famous for leaking

842
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,100
stuff they're like I didn't know I had

843
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,720
all those scans of social security

844
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,919
numbers

845
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,760
so make sure that you pass on to your

846
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,219
teams to your senior leadership that

847
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,899
data security is everyone's

848
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,918
responsibility data security policies

849
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,560
um you know right in human language at

850
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,960
least if you have your main policy write

851
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,940
something smaller so that normal people

852
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,940
can understand it not just Wizards

853
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,099
make it a living document and what I

854
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,379
mean by that is change as needed

855
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,540
one of the biggest mistakes I see with

856
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,359
companies that we work with

857
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:39,179
is they use a single vendor because

858
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,899
there's no standard to cyber security

859
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:45,659
one size does not fit all what one

860
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,480
company catches another vendor may miss

861
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,540
and we've found things that some of the

862
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,760
biggest names in the game have missed

863
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,739
a lot of times they automate everything

864
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,560
and give you a 400 page of false

865
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,940
positives and you're like we're really

866
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,440
working

867
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,660
so multiple vendors if you have the

868
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,020
budget that's important encrypt data

869
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,660
when you encrypt data people like me

870
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,760
when I find it I go well it's encrypted

871
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,980
and I move on and the bad guys do the

872
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,800
same uh you know sure older algorithms

873
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,540
might be able to be cracked but nobody

874
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,400
has that kind of time yet

875
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,240
that's it guys for me and uh I want to

876
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,040
thank you all so much for coming here

877
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,260

878
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,240
me rant about

879
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,960
cyber security data breaches and and the

880
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,480
anonymous cyber war and if anybody has

881
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,480
any questions I would be happy to answer

882
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,260
the best I can

883
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,940
no it's it's okay yeah there's there's

884
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,599
no problem so until we get to the next

885
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,820
step I'll tell you guys some stories

886
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,060
since I lived there for 10 years

887
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,780
Eastern Europe was the only place that I

888
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,579
had ever been drunk at a baby's birthday

889
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,079
party

890
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,760
and I don't mean drunk I mean like

891
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,000
smashed and you know they're like

892
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,320
the baby and the babies in the corner

893
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,540
smoking a cigarette like they're good

894
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,460
people you know when I first went there

895
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,280
the driving was so insane that that I

896
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,960
said you could drive a car on the wrong

897
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,599
side of the road with a goat tied to the

898
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,460
roof of the car and a baby riding the

899
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,859
goat and all three of you are drunk and

900
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,359
it would cost you ten dollars for a

901
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,900
police escort home

902
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,839
which is true but no it really is sad to

903
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,339
see what has happened there because you

904
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,839
know even though I am American it's been

905
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,599
my home for 10 years and

906
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,700
um you know these were good European

907
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,440
people who you know really didn't do

908
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,880
anything wrong except for have a bad

909
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,440
neighbor which we've all had bad

910
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,579
neighbors

911
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,680
um you know we've fought over fences and

912
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,619
trees and different things if anyone

913
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,300
does have any questions about data

914
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,280
breaches or you know I'm sure you guys

915
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,960
know a little bit about data security so

916
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,540
I don't need to answer all of that feel

917
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,520
free to send me an email I I don't do

918
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,500
much on the Twitter anymore but I got

919
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,300
some Anonymous followers

920
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,300
but thank you for coming guys and enjoy

921
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,670
