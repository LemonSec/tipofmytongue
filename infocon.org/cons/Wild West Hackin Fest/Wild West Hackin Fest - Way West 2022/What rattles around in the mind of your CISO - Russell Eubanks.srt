1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,160
we've all come here from different

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,220
different paths and Russell started with

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,320
um manual labor type stuff physical

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,059
stuff in a factory working on the floor

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,380
there and deciding to know what maybe

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,240
this is not for me so like a lot of us

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,619
he he looked around to see what was

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,539
available found some courses he could

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,760
take to to learn while he's working you

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,320
know doing that double time stuff while

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,480
you're young enough to manage it and uh

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,640
and it's worked out for him he's um

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,980
would you get a bachelor from Tennessee

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,560
at Chattanooga uh you've been uh senior

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,420
vice president CIO and CSO of the

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,340
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta so if

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,360
you want to know how to forge money

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,820
afterwards Russell's Your Man

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,700
and um so he's he's got some insight

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,379
into what's in the mind of your Chief

21
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,059
Information Security Officer having been

22
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,860
one and worked with them and I can only

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,960
imagine what you've had to deal with in

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,660
the Federal Reserve so a lot of

25
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,100
perspective a lot of good things here so

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,420
Russell I'm going to hand off the mic

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,000
here I'll mute it first and

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,239
um Russell Eubanks I was gobsmacked

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,459
I remember the day so well

30
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,179
that day

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,740
built up my courage to go up to my

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,479
boss's office and just for a perspective

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
the very top of the left Executive Suite

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,060
you had to be invited

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,640
my immediate supervisor the second in

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,100
charge of this place the Federal Reserve

37
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,140
Bank of Atlanta had to pretty much be

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,580
summoned to go there you couldn't just

39
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,799
casually hey boss what's going on and

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,960
the reason for that was it was nice

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,299
person nothing you know but oftentimes

42
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,979
there was like senators and governors

43
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,320
and Mayors and leaders and people you

44
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,060
hear about on the news up there to

45
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,040
advise and guide

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,740
my boss and his boss the number one and

47
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,500
number two in charge

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,360
so I kind of made an appointment work

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,640
with executive assistant to get on the

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,780
schedule on this day

51

had a suit on ready to go a little bit

52
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,460
nervous because I knew what I was about

53
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,259

54
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,840

58

and I said on this day

70
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,040
this day hey boss love the opportunity

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,080

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,280
the ciso leading the huge and very

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,220
talented security team

75
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,200
but I think today

76
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,480
March 9th 2020. I think that's a great

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,579
day for me to go start my own business

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,980
see the Sunday before just a couple days

79
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,319
before the fed's very methodical in what

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,160
they do they're very uh open after they

81
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,920
make moves in place they got meetings

82
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,060
scheduled for when they'll talk about

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,519
the economy and just this week they made

84
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,019
some adjustments to interest rates very

85
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,440
methodical very clear very process

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,220
oriented see the Sunday before this day

87
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,500
without warning without a notice they

88
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,060
had an emergency meeting and they cut

89
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,860
the interest rates because of this word

90
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,780
that we didn't quite understand yet that

91
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,840
we all know all too well

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,120
was starting to have an impact

93
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,659
on the global economy

94
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,299
I believe today is a great day for me to

95
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,060
go start my business

96
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,580
it's what I said

97
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,560
to my boss that day

98
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,819
he says I want you to think about it

99
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,920
it's a big decision

100
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,239
you sure you want to do this you're kind

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,500
of at the top of the order you're

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,120
helping to run a very important

103
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,459
organization that do not take that for

104
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,140
granted five and a half years an amazing

105
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,180
time

106
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,680
I walked back to my office

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
looked out the window

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,599
I took another deep breath and I thought

109
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,420
what the world uh did you just do you

110
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,000
walked away from the thing that uh as BB

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,519
said earlier I started my career at

112
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,199
working in a factory steel toe boots

113
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,680
hard labor very dangerous type of work

114
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,880
environment

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,919
took advantage of tuition reimbursement

116
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,720
they allowed me they paid for my school

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,400
I went to school during the day I worked

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,020
at night and took advantage of that

119
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,100
benefit

120
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,560
I suppose I'd still be there if not for

121
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,380
them allowing me to go do that

122
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,159
as a benefit

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,360
so what in the world was rattling around

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,820
in my mind at that time and I'll tell

125
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,580
you you may never be a CSO and I get

126
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,100
that you may want to be one someday in

127
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,600
the future I get that or maybe you're

128
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,620
wondering

129
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,300
what in the heck was Russell thinking

130
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,979
what in the heck rattles around in the

131
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,500
mind of people that have the privilege

132
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,600
of leading people that lead people that

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,479
do cyber security things so I think you

134
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,800
know with your pen tester into security

135
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,540
or just wondering

136
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,120
how can you have a better understanding

137
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,100
of what's going on in the mind of your

138
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,660
respective security leader whether they

139
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,000
have the CSO title or not if you look at

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,740
the org chart and they're the top person

141
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,720
and that top person is responsible for

142
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,780
security things even if you're the

143
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,979
person who gets ready in the morning

144
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,020
with your whole security team like if

145
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,720
you're the team of one

146
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,880
how to think about

147
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,160
that see for me

148
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,380
the best advice I've ever been given is

149
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,479
this right here get wisdom as cheaply as

150
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,460
you can what does that look like someone

151
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,160
who's non-cyber non-tech someone who's

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
inside we're hanging out here it's an

153
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,060
amazing event yesterday today and

154
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,539
tomorrow Wild West hackenfest

155
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,520
what does it look like to be able to

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,460
learn from others to not have to get the

157
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,620
same metaphorical scars on your back or

158
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,139
punches in the gut are those problems

159
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,840
that we read about

160
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,060
on a pretty regular basis what would it

161
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,699
look like to be able to get wisdom

162
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,539
as cheaply as you can that's my design

163
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,479
for this and of all the things to think

164
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,919
about I thought well what how can I

165
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,900
distill this message into just three

166
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,020
points three things that I want to

167
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,460
invite you to consider over the next few

168
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,360
minutes

169
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,720
in this journey of what in the world

170
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,500
rattles around in the mind of people

171
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,979
that lead cyber security teams so first

172
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,979
thing first thing I thought you'd laugh

173
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,419
I thought today was a good point for

174
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,740
okay no okay

175
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,360
it's kind of directional here the first

176
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,759
thing that people that lead people that

177
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,020
lead people that do cyber security

178
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,000
things need to do is to be able to

179
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,139
manage up

180
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,240
but if I were completely honest I would

181
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,100
have to tell you I hate that work I hate

182
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,620
that work and respect folks who are

183
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,120
managers I've been a manager before but

184
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,360
I I don't ever remember in my career

185
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,240
waking up in the morning before the

186
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,139
alarm goes off and say I'm excited I get

187
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,660
to go be managed today I want to be

188
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,460
managed today I want someone to tell me

189
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,340
what to do and I'm going to do that when

190
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,440
I worked in a factory I was managed

191
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,660
literally they had a time you can go to

192
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,639
the bathroom at this time you can step

193
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,220
away from your 500 time steel press that

194
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,319
goes up and down and makes stoves at

195
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,880
Maytag and I'm grateful for the

196
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,500
opportunity I had there

197
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,840
but I was managed I was told what to do

198
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,180
and when to do it and I was expected to

199
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,099
be there and catch pieces of Steel that

200
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,900
eventually became a Maytag stove because

201
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,400
I was being managed

202
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,099
I like this idea what's it like to lead

203
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,680
up that same relationship that I had

204
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,500
with my leader at the fed the second in

205
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,780
charge of very important organization in

206
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,400
southeast part of the country where I

207
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,080
live in Atlanta

208
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,160
this idea of how can I help

209
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,800
second in command there

210
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,660
to understand what the team that I was

211
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,699
privileged to lead was doing with the

212
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,220
team that I was previously was doing so

213
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,979
that he and before he was a sheep where

214
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,300
he and she could be able to understand

215
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,800
oh

216
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,539
that's what the team's up to that's what

217
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:22,919
they're trying to achieve that's the

218
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,740
struggles that they're facing without my

219
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,319
leaders having to go hang out here with

220
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,080
us which would be kind of cool to see or

221
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,640
having to go take a class or get a

222
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
certification or do a training or some

223
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,360
all the things the barriers that would

224
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,419
be in place if we're not careful when we

225
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,919
try to communicate the things that we're

226
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,699
trying to do

227
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,760
what would it look like if we as Leaders

228
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,800
you as your particular security leader

229
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,940
became

230
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,180
able to learn another language

231
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,740
what if we could learn another language

232
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,080
we could speak another language uh be

233
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,060
able to communicate in a way so that

234
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,380
people can actually understand what

235
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,420
we're saying and you might be tempted to

236
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,860
think okay English it's a pretty good

237
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,779
language some of you are able to speak

238
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,700
other languages I admire you I'm not

239
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,560
really able to do that

240
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,760
but what if we think of being able to to

241
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,060
speak I.T and to speak cyber but then to

242
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,339
do so in a way that we can communicate

243
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,560
to people so they can understand what

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,420
we're doing what if we be able to speak

245
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,740
the language of business

246
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,700
what's the business goals what's the

247
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,580
business Mission what's the business

248
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,019
strategic priorities what are those and

249
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,660
how can we connect the dots

250
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,180
so that our leaders our stakeholders our

251
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,459
the chair of our board our boss our team

252
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,740
can be able to understand the real

253
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,300
reason why we're doing the things that

254
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,700
we're doing and oftentimes this comes in

255
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,620
the form not with that Paul vixi earlier

256
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,420
I walked into the room when he was going

257
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,180
on like look there's a slot of TCP dub I

258
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,500
remember going through and parsing

259
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,660
through that back in the day

260
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,760
but I can't take that slide I can't take

261
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,380
technical things like that and

262
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,560
communicate what the team is up to to an

263
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,820
audience that doesn't understand that

264
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,380
it's hex and you got to translate it got

265
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,760
to understand and go bit by bit and

266
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,160
figure out what's happening there I need

267
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,600
to know that

268
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,360
long time ago I had the opportunity to

269
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,820
do that but I can't take that to my boss

270
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,100
and say look at our team we deserve a

271
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,480
pat on the back we're doing really great

272
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,740
work

273
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,680
we need to be able to help them

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,420
see the real reason what we're doing

275
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,459
maybe it's in a chart maybe it's in a

276
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,700
graph maybe it's in some colorful little

277
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,620
visuals that helps them be able to do

278
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,080
what leaders do best

279
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,279
let's just make a decision

280
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,760
draw a conclusion

281
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,779
invest in things that can help the

282
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,459
company go further

283
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,339
and go faster and another thing that we

284
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,800
get to do as leaders

285
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,959
whether we're leading ourselves

286
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,180
leading a team leading a whole cyber

287
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,459
security function is to also in that

288
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,519
moment to our leader to our board to our

289
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,440
audit committee to whomever we're

290
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,800
communicating the message be mindful of

291
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,540
and maybe even sometimes close your eyes

292
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,839
and in your mind see the faces of

293
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,140
those that you're privileged to lead and

294
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,459
represent and understand what they're

295
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,860
working on the challenges they're facing

296
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,899
as you're delivering the message of here

297
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,380
leader peer leadership team here chair

298
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,120
of the board what we're working on and

299
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,459
how it helps the organization go further

300
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,599
and go faster

301
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,100
so in this first one

302
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,160
again get wisdom as cheaply as you can

303
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,459
what is one thing that I would invite

304
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,720
you to consider

305
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,019
is there any wisdom in that lesson where

306
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,640
you don't have to learn that lesson the

307
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,180
hard way like I did

308
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,360
what's the wisdom

309
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,260
in that lesson

310
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,579
for me I've learned that my Chief

311
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,260
Financial Officer the person in charge

312
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,779
of the finances like they allow my

313
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,880
project to be funded they deny my

314
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,980
project for being funded they say I

315
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,420
don't want to talk about or I don't

316
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,040
really care about that cyber stuff just

317
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,680
go away Russell look I'd rather you just

318
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,240
leave and come back maybe next year

319
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,700
we'll talk next year

320
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,440
therapy is the operating of business

321
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,600
they're busy funding priorities for the

322
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,399
company so they can achieve their goals

323
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,140
and their priorities

324
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,540
they're not going to learn to speak our

325
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,060
language what would it look like

326
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,220
for us to speak the language of our

327
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,940
Chief Financial Officer

328
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,860
our chief executive officer our chief

329
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,420
operating officer so that we can

330
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,100
communicate to them what's their

331
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,540
priorities in a way that they can

332
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,740
understand

333
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,100
and make a business decision

334
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,899
an example I give and some of you heard

335
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,820
me say this before that you've anybody

336
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,760
been to or a fan of Nordstrom so

337
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,260
Nordstrom an organization you go by

338
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,700
clothes maybe you have some clothes and

339
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,320
maybe you shop there on a regular basis

340
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,980
as it turns out Nordstrom as an example

341
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,579
they have a reason why they exist and

342
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,380
they have that in the form of a mission

343
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,200
statement the reason Nordstrom exists is

344
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,639
and there's words you can go to their

345
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,740
website right now you can type and say

346
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,079
why does Nordstrom exist

347
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,779
you can know that and if you were to do

348
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,279
that on the next slide here it shows

349
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,800
exactly what that is the reason that

350
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,680
Nordstrom exists

351
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,720
that's right to give customers the most

352
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,920
compelling

353
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,100
shopping experience possible

354
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,620
that's why Nordstrom exists now do they

355
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,540
have cyber needs of course do they have

356
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,399
I.T needs yes do people try to steal

357
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,740
from them and get a pair of jeans or

358
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,260
shirts or hats or cool things from them

359
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,880
without paying for it all those things

360
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,800
are true

361
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,459
but the real reason Nordstrom exists is

362
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,260
to give customers the most compelling

363
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,959
shopping experience possible that's why

364
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,120
they're there

365
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,920
so with Nordstrom as an example

366
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,779
for you is

367
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,880
what's the mission of your organization

368
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,760
why does your company exist

369
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,820
what is it trying to achieve

370
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,860
and while cyber is important to your

371
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,300
company it's important to my company

372
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,920
it's important important to every place

373
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,480
I've worked at every place you work at

374
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,180
every place you will work at

375
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,300
so far in my career I've never worked at

376
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,360
an organization that just exists to do

377
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,440
cyber

378
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,959
I love cyber you love cyber we all love

379
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,820
cyber and we're here this weekend this

380
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,040
weekend weekend because of cyber things

381
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,019
we want to get better we do

382
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,820
that's not the real reason why we look

383
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,139
at our logs

384
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,120
that's not the real reason why we

385
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,980
respond to incidents I remember back in

386
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,600
the day we had pagers the pager would go

387
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,600
off and it would wake up my dog which

388
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,220
would wake up my wife my wife would give

389
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,540
me one of these and says hey your thing

390
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,740
is going off again there must be

391
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,360
something going on at your company wake

392
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,279
up and go deal with your

393
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,240
noise maker

394
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,000
but the real reason if we were to put

395
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,680
ourselves in a position of working on

396
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,560
the security team at Nordstrom

397
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,720
the real reason they're looking at logs

398
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,040
the real reason they're communicating

399
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,320
policy the real reason they're doing the

400
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,880
compliance things that they surely have

401
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,079
to do

402
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,880
is

403
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,680
the reason I look at the logs every

404
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,660
morning is I want to help give customers

405
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,639
the most compelling shopping experience

406
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,680
possible

407
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,899
that's a place where we can

408
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,779
whether we're CSO or not

409
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,240
whether we want to be a Cecil or not

410
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,680
whether we're wondering why in the world

411
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,480
is my boss who's leading our cyber

412
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,040
security team think about these thoughts

413
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,480
of our mission statement I'd rather do

414
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,160
cyber things

415
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,079
instead

416
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,240
what's the real reason why you're doing

417
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,680
the things

418
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,360
that you're doing

419
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,019
and my advice would be to look at your

420
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,639
mission statement

421
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,740
half subtasks because I'm here I'm doing

422
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,839
logs I'm doing policy I'm responding to

423
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,240
incidents I'm doing forensics whatever

424
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,639
I'm doing but tie it back to it and say

425
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,199
the real reason I'm doing what I'm doing

426
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,240
is

427
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,420
and simply copy paste make it be easier

428
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,519
for those who are in charge of Finance

429
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,680
make it be easier for those who are on

430
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,480
the board of your direct your on the

431
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,940
board of directors for your organization

432
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,399
your Auditors your assessors to say oh

433
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,260
that's why you're do you're doing that

434
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,500
and a sub-task is

435
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,600
what you're doing your actual tasks and

436
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,920
the things that you're trying to achieve

437
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,779
what would it look like

438
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,420
to speak a second language the language

439
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,800
in this case

440
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,899
of business that's thing number one

441
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,420
thing number two

442
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,440
thing number two thing number two is

443
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,320
another view another Paradigm another

444
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,300
thing that rattles around in the mind of

445
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,980
someone who has the privilege to lead

446
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,759
people bless you that do cyber things

447
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,600
is this

448
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,400
the need to lead down and by down I

449
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,500
don't mean talk down or demeaning I'm

450
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,179
thinking it in my mind of an org chart

451
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,040
you think of the org chart got the

452
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,959
security people the leaders of security

453
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,459
people and then maybe the director maybe

454
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,319
the managers maybe the AVP whatever that

455
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,880
might look like to look down the

456
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,380
organization chart

457
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,480
and say what are they thinking what's on

458
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,179
their mind what's important to them what

459
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,220
are they saying right now

460
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,620
what are they worried about

461
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,660
you're new in leadership maybe it's not

462
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,220
that long ago that you were in that same

463
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,740
position so you can have some empathy

464
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,080
yeah I remember what it felt like and

465
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,720
maybe some of the things your folks at

466
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,860
your privilege lead are saying things

467
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,000
like well Russell he's not technical

468
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,960
anymore

469
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,820
yeah he used to have domain admin access

470
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,460
he used to make gpos and tell Windows

471
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,960
servers what to do

472
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,840
but now that's not necessary anymore now

473
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,700
he's lost his technical edgers maybe

474
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,080
he's not one of us he spends all his

475
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,580
time up at the top floor talking to

476
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,740
those Executives and sometimes it comes

477
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,559
in a suit versus in well things that

478
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,039
aren't suit this idea is it's different

479
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,600
Russell just doesn't get us anymore

480
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,500
because hopefully what your security

481
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,380
leader your CSO your director your

482
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,960
manager whatever their title is

483
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,900
maybe they're focusing on these verbs

484
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,820
instead these things what are things

485
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,419
that they could do that lead here's

486
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:28,679
where we're going to go

487
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,919
a great book that I like to read from

488
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,660
John Maxwell he's written like over 50

489
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,240
books and actually when he was asked hey

490
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,220
John how did you read 50 books I saw him

491
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,559
in an interview response how is it

492
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,000
you're able to write 50 books and his

493
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,380
answer was amazing his answer was

494
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,200
anybody heard this quote from

495
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,419
you've heard of John Maxwell okay so we

496
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,940
have cool uh so he's asked how is it you

497
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,380
written 50 books and his answer kind of

498
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,140
surprised me says because I'm old

499
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,299
that's

500
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:59,700
well played well played uh but he gives

501
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,559
this test he has a leadership test in

502
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,640
one of his books he says if you wonder

503
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,320
if you're a leader there's only one

504
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,460
thing that you need to do

505
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,480
if you're wondering if you're a leader

506
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,020
all you got to do

507
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,520
turn around and see anyone following you

508
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,660
if you turn around and you see that

509
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,160
someone's following you then you've

510
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,299
passed the test you're earlier if you

511
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,380
turn around and you look there's nobody

512
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,679
there

513
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,840
maybe not

514
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
leading motivating sharing finding

515
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,700
things are important to those and for

516
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,679
those that you're privileged to lead and

517
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,600
serve

518
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,000
versus boss around and tell them what

519
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,980
time they can do or can't do certain

520
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,299
things

521
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,460
succession plans one of the most

522
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,679
important things I did long before I

523
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,440
built up my courage to go and uh decide

524
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,080
today's a great day to go leave a very

525
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,500
stable organization

526
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,520
is working with who would be nominated

527
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,580
years before that as the deputy see so

528
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,679
the person who's like second in line or

529
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,299
a succession planning

530
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,220
see why was that important

531
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,400
whether I knew I was leaving or not it

532
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,620
was important for me to identify or have

533
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,380
someone help me identify who's someone

534
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,720
who might be the next in line and maybe

535
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,280
it's two or three years from now but

536
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,740
maybe through education maybe through

537
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,539
experience maybe through exposure hey

538
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,919
I'm going to go break the board next

539
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,780
month and I'd like you to come with me

540
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,660
wear a suit try not to say anything and

541
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,820
just kind of hang out and it may be

542
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,679
something as simple as that

543
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,940
to expose them to the formalities expose

544
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,160
them to the conversations

545
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,720
from people who have an extraordinary

546
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,760
amount of impact on how the organization

547
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,559
works

548
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,020
the hand and do more things and more

549
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,480
things to help them get into that

550
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,700
position or maybe having strategic plans

551
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,520
hey I can metaphorically look into the

552
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,080
future that says three years from now

553
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,860
what would it look like if we had

554
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,460
stop EDR in place or AI in place or

555
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,840
whatever acronyms that you like

556
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,580
something somebody'd be nice to have

557
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,160
those things to not have to worry about

558
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,600
a certain condition making sure that the

559
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,760
configurations that are in place are

560
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,620
monitored and checked and whenever they

561
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,720
change we know and be able to respond to

562
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,179
those immediately

563
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,520
I like to ask a question when I teach

564
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,919
and mentor and help others uh do

565
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,419
Consulting as well I like to ask this

566
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,919
question I found a single question that

567
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,500
I can ask and that question

568
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,419
I want to have different answers to it

569
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,059
based on the individuals or the

570
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,460
teammates that I asked that question up

571
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,919
and the question is how long can you

572
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,000
stand

573
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,500
to not know

574
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,480
how long can you stand to not know I got

575
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,280
that single question I can ask that

576
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,140
single question of a bunch of people and

577
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,820
I can expect a different answer but I

578
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,280
want to get their answer not my answer

579
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,860
let's just imagine ask that question how

580
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,260
long can you stand to not know the

581
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,760
running configuration on your production

582
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,900
firewall has changed

583
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,399
I know my answer

584
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,020
what's your answer

585
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,539
network administrator person in charge

586
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,179
of and monitoring and checking that how

587
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,460
long can you sir how long can you ma'am

588
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,140
stand to not know

589
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,120
until the production until the running

590
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,799
config on your production firewalls have

591
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,960
changed and they'll look at their watch

592
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,419
they'll say well

593
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,760
maybe I can stand to wait

594
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,559
five minutes

595
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,600
cool five minutes there's my question

596
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
I've asked that person that question and

597
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,039
I'm going to find out for them how long

598
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,780
they can stand to not know the running

599
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,340
config on the production firewall is

600
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,500
changed five minutes got it thank you

601
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,480
very much we're going to work on our

602
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,039
security team to give you the capability

603
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,740
to know that and ideally have a hook

604
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,659
into change control that says was there

605
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,520
an authorized change window for say

606
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,860
Thursday at 7 pm where Thursday at 7 p.m

607
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,020
someone put in a ticket they said yes

608
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,520
we're going to change the running config

609
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,740
on our production firewalls at 7 pm on

610
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,419
Thursday

611
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,580
what's the capability that we now have

612
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,700
the capability is we can detect

613
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,860
authorized change

614
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,659
fill out the ticket I'm going to do this

615
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,400
work and when this work happens I'm

616
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,460
going to be notified about it yes

617
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,440
seriously reach out your right hand all

618
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,760
the way over pat yourself on the back

619
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,559
that's a huge accomplishment to be able

620
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,700
to detect

621
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,419
authorized change because

622
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,980
not because Auditors are going to give

623
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,100
you uh or not give you a finding not

624
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,240
because someone's going to come and

625
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,100
check on you but when that change

626
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,740
happens to the running config on your

627
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,260
production firewall and there's not a

628
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,360
change approval ticket I want someone to

629
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,380
wake up

630
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,600
and that someone can be me that someone

631
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,460
could be you but that change is

632
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,380
something important and I can take that

633
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,880
same question I can ask someone maybe

634
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,559
they're in charge of

635
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,419
Windows security

636
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,100
a person in charge of Windows security

637
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,340
how long can you stand to not know when

638
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,200
someone's been added to say an admin

639
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,539
group maybe domain admins

640
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,039
and you're going to give me that answer

641
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,799
and maybe you'll say you know

642
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,780
I can know right away but I really want

643
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,299
to know in a report the next morning can

644
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:13,799
you can you make that possible can you

645
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,360
give me a report in the morning when I

646
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,460
sip my coffee I'm not sure what to work

647
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,620
on

648
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,539
I've got something in my inbox and that

649
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,760
thing on my inbox can tell me

650
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,380
something's changed was there a ticket

651
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,120
for it was an improved thing and just as

652
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,860
a way to just make sure that I know when

653
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,659
that happens I've taken that single

654
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,880
question asked it to another key

655
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,340
stakeholder I've got their answer and I

656
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,679
provide that visibility

657
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,900
and the form of a strategic plan it says

658
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,460
in the future we want to have these

659
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,960
capabilities

660
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
oftentimes leveraging technology things

661
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,059
that we know here

662
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,740
I didn't teach anything you want to know

663
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,539
when those things happen

664
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,400
but unless you've programmed your

665
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,860
Technologies maybe your log solution

666
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,960
maybe your configuration monitoring you

667
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,820
may not have the capability to answer

668
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,220
those questions for your stakeholders

669
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,900
and answer those questions for the teams

670
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,880
that you're privileged to lead

671
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,600
another thing that I always enjoy doing

672
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,179
when I wasn't traveling

673
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,159
I really don't miss traveling except for

674
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,840
I've Loved traveling here I've not been

675
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,280
like all of us not probably not been

676
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,320
traveling a whole lot but when I wasn't

677
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,720
traveling at the FED I take the same

678
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,000
backpack right here put a fresh cup of

679
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,919
coffee or fresh cup for a fresh cup of

680
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,360
coffee in it

681
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,700
and I would have my executive assistant

682
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,860
to block time on my calendar

683
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,140
get to work get all settled in and I got

684
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,120
an appointment on my calendar every day

685
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,980
I was in the office I had an appointment

686
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,260
I would get a cup of coffee and that cup

687
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,299
of coffee I would pour in there and I

688
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,020
just kind of walk around

689
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,059
how you doing what's going on is there

690
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,700
any chance that anything I can help with

691
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,260
can I

692
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,860
loan me to you

693
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,140
there's a problem a challenge why is it

694
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,700
working that way why doesn't any people

695
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,679
get us what why does that decision come

696
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,000
why is there a focus on the audit

697
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,039
whatever it might be or maybe it's just

698
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,380
I really we should just go away and you

699
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,539
know what that that's cool too

700
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,360
but looking for things that only we can

701
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,580
do as people who have the privilege to

702
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,080
lead people that lead people to do cyber

703
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
things

704
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,200
Maybe

705
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,940
being intentional about that maybe

706
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,340
saying in the future the capability want

707
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,320
to have is that

708
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,480
being fully aware of our current state

709
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,640
here's how things are right now we wish

710
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,020
they'd get better but we're not going to

711
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,700
wake up and magically they're going to

712
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,679
be better

713
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,840
by casting vision for it saying here's

714
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,000
what we expect in the future how can we

715
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,039
get there and have the capability to

716
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,260
answer questions such as how long can

717
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,159
you stand to not know

718
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,980
ask someone that question take that

719
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,320
answer with gratitude and go figure out

720
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,279
how to give them what they need most

721
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:02,460
so what's the wisdom in that lesson

722
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,559
what's the wisdomen number two thing

723
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,340
number two

724
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,700
for me

725
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,880
it's this what can only

726
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,760
you do what can only you do see when I

727
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,340
was working at the Atlanta fed my the

728
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,620
Atlantis massive City maybe you've flown

729
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,299
through there maybe you've got stuck in

730
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,220
traffic there and for that I sincerely

731
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,200
apologize it's terrible terrible traffic

732
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,840
it just is big cities are just terrible

733
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,980
traffic

734
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,820
so I'll live 25 miles Northwest of where

735
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,520
the offices were located

736
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,320
and what that meant was I had at least a

737
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,360
45 minute commute each way

738
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,400
on the way to work I would load up my

739
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,460
phone with podcasts I load up I did I

740
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,200
have full time to call my parents call

741
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
my kids go all the things to kind of

742
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,640
occupy my time taking it very boring and

743
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,419
traffic filled commute to work and on

744
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:58,980
the one of my other things that I had on

745
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,919
my list of things to do for my commute

746
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,159
West okay Russell what are three things

747
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,520
as see so that only you can do what are

748
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,960
three things and it wasn't that I'm

749
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,520
better than someone else right and that

750
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,320
was not that perspective at all but some

751
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,179
things that if I did not do those things

752
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,919
they just wouldn't get done

753
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,020
maybe that thing was to prepare

754
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,659
materials for a board briefing

755
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,820
maybe it was to prepare a justification

756
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,220
to the executive team to promote someone

757
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,919
to the position of Deputy CSO

758
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,679
maybe it was a proposal to fund the

759
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,480
capability to respond to ransomware

760
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,279
faster it's just making up things these

761
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,020
ideas of if I did not do those things

762
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,000
those things would not get done and so

763
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,919
on my commute I would think thing number

764
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,460
one thing number two thing number three

765
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,700
got it and as I go about my day I'll

766
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,400
look for opportunities to pause and do

767
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,279
those things and on the days when I'm

768
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,039
commuting back home hour and a half ish

769
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,679
which is just awful

770
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,320
I would do a little checklist how do I

771
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,960
do it thing number one did I do it

772
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,539
I did cool thing number two did I do

773
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:07,760
that too

774
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,380
yes I did and then thing number three on

775
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,880
the way home with plenty of extra time

776
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,659
there to see how well um uh holding

777
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,340
myself accountable to things this wasn't

778
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,380
my boss telling me what to do this was

779
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,059
me saying if I don't do those things

780
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,360
it's going to block people from uh

781
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,799
achieving their goals it's going to

782
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,179
block them from being able to do the

783
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,919
things that they need to do the things

784
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,200
they're counting on me to do I need to

785
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,840
go and do those and prove something

786
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,159
present something unblock something

787
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:37,200
whatever that something is and when that

788
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,399
happened

789
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,559
one two three thing number one thing

790
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,000
number two thing number three occurred

791
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,500
and felt really good inside

792
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,720
I went to meetings I did some things and

793
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,860
all and I did those three things

794
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,580
and on days when I did not and TBH it

795
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,460
happened a fair amount

796
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,860
the next morning the next day I went

797
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,200
back into the office I had thing number

798
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,880
one thing number two thing number three

799
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,919
and whatever leftover carryover things

800
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,480
from the previous day that we're not

801
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,640
able to be done holding myself to

802
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,820
account

803
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,380
what are some things that only you or

804
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,760
only they can do

805
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,899
and are their little systems are there

806
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:26,460
reminders are there calendar

807
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,520
appointments are there behaviors in your

808
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,480
commute

809
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,279
and starting your day or planning for

810
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,440
your next day they can position you to

811
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,480
be able to do just that

812
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,340
how can you set yourself up for success

813
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,799
and not just yourself but those that

814
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,659
you're privileged to lead

815
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,360
that's thing number two third and final

816
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,980
thing number

817
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,020
three

818
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,440
so we've led up

819
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,620
the org we've LED down the org what's

820
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,480
left

821
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,380
yeah side to side we need to we need to

822
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,159
move laterally

823
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,600
as we do that

824
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,179
who are those people what

825
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:13,679
what are they up to I can think about

826
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,440
boss and people can think of people that

827
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,899
report directly to me but who are these

828
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,880
folks these folks are

829
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,320
again if you look at the whole

830
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,480
organization chart

831
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,720
who are my peers

832
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,120
maybe it is the Chief Financial Officer

833
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,580
maybe it is the chief physical security

834
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,520
officer maybe it is director of

835
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,220
facilities maybe it's the manager of

836
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,779
Maintenance and Facilities

837
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,220
but as I think about them

838
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,340
my task is not to try to convince them

839
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,399
to come to Wild West hacking Fest as

840
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,500
cool as an experience it is they're not

841
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,640
going to come they're they're doing

842
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,640
their things my job is

843
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,200
to help make cyber more relevant to them

844
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,140
not by having hex not by having cyber

845
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,360
things but by helping them connect the

846
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,860
dots

847
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,620
in a meaningful way maybe

848
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,899
this is by going to

849
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,240
their team meetings like their

850
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,220
department meetings that they lead and

851
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,539
they talk about the things that are

852
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,460
important to them

853
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,340
and not just have a cyber briefing once

854
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,020
a year because it makes us feel good to

855
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,640
go give a cyber briefing

856
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,440
to them once a year

857
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,220
maybe it could look like that

858
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,899
relationships with them matter a great

859
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,100
deal

860
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,380
and I'll get some ideas of how to do

861
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,140
that for this idea to help take cyber

862
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,760
with them

863
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,200
because the truth is they're going to go

864
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,539
places you can't go

865
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,159
they're going to be exposed to things

866
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,500
that because of your role and their role

867
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,820
being so different they're going to be

868
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,200
exposed to things that you won't be

869
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,640
exposed to

870
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,140
what would it look like to

871
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,820
metaphorically what would it look like

872
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,240
to literally have them take cyber with

873
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,039
them when they go about their day when

874
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,539
they leave their teams when they solve

875
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:04,620
their problems when they're faced with

876
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,659
the things they're faced with

877
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:09,179
that aren't cyber things

878
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:10,980
but what's that message what's that one

879
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,760
thing

880
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,519
that we want them to be aware of

881
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,440
maybe you heard before this idea and

882
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,880
maybe at your company you've used that

883
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,380
expression cyber is everyone's job

884
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,240
anyone have that at your company

885
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,860
or companies you've used to work at a

886
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,200
couple of y'all are saying yeah cyber is

887
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,159
everyone's job

888
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,659
what if your job's not cyber

889
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,700
but if you are an accountant

890
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,299
how does that count it

891
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,000
think about cyber how does the

892
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,580
accountant know the thing that you want

893
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,200
them to do when they see something weird

894
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,059
maybe they see their Mouse their cursor

895
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,200
moving

896
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,700
but oh that's not supposed to happen

897
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,679
I've got like hands-free on the keyboard

898
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,320
and things are happening

899
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,380
cyber is everyone's job hmm I'm not sure

900
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,480
that that seems vague

901
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,480
maybe we can borrow from others now you

902
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,340
can borrow from other entities who

903
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,080
invite or compel or have a call to

904
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,300
action that says here's what we want you

905
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,379
to do

906
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,560
you the accountant we want you when you

907
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,800
see something we want you to what

908
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,760
yeah

909
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,159
maybe that's the call to action

910
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,659
they're not going to decode packets

911
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,980
they're not going to understand but

912
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,839
maybe the message is when something

913
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,879
weird happens here's Russell's cell

914
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,080
phone number when something weird has

915
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,239
happened here's a email address or a

916
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,099
slack Channel or a team's message

917
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,260
whatever technology whatever that one

918
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,899
thing you want that account to do is

919
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,599
maybe you enroll them by saying you're a

920
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,440
part

921
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,199
of our team we don't have enough people

922
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,480
on our cyber team to sit beside everyone

923
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,339
as you make your decision to go to go

924
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,020
about doing your day but when you see

925
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,040
something

926
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,619
here's how we want you the accountant to

927
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,980
say something

928
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,599
what would it look like when they go to

929
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,300
meetings and places and briefings that

930
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,800
you can't go to

931
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,920
for them to be aware of that

932
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,440
to know that we're not asking them to

933
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,480
fix the problem even if they click on

934
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,240
something that causes something bad

935
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,060
to happen and life happens

936
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,099
but even if they're the one who caused

937
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,540
an incident

938
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,260
for them to recognize the responsibility

939
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,180
and the desire we have for them to pick

940
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,099
up that phone or call that or send that

941
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:27,720
message and say you know what I did this

942
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,579
thing and I recognize it's going to hurt

943
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,020
the company and I recognize if I don't

944
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,760
say something

945
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,099
that it might be a while until you see

946
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,200
something or see the impact of what

947
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,220
happened there

948
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,740
what would it look like if we allowed

949
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,400
them to take cyber with them by making

950
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,640
it clear and actionable and not 400

951
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,500
things to do but one thing what's that

952
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,760
one thing

953
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,740
but I was briefing one of my peers

954
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,020
former Pierce responsible for a

955
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,960
significant financial system like money

956
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,260
moving around the world financial system

957
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,180
I gave her a briefing she was literally

958
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,400
in charge of this whole operation of

959
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,380
moving money around the world

960
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,180
favorite briefing here's what we're

961
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,560
doing here's our plans here's our

962
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,920
current capabilities here's some of the

963
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
opportunities that we have to make cyber

964
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,359
better and more relevant for this very

965
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:22,859
important Financial system

966
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,540
and she says hey thanks for the briefing

967
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,859
I love that you come to my office every

968
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,119
month and you give me a briefing of

969
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,220
what's going on with this cyber thing

970
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,220
but I gotta tell you

971
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,859
sometimes I struggle with what you want

972
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,599
me to do about this

973
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,560
and so my former peer

974
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,839
my former colleague Cheryl

975
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,119
she asked me a question

976
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,400
and this is her question

977
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,200
Russell how

978
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,359
how do I think about this how do you

979
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,920
want me to think about this report and

980
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,780
it's got colors it's got numbers and I

981
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,700
see Trends and things going up and down

982
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,880
and I I can sort of understand that but

983
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,680
how would you like me to think about

984
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,820
that

985
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,320
and I thought

986
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,180
are you kidding we spent hours making

987
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,500
this briefing I've come up to your

988
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,560
office once a month for so many years

989
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,839
and you're just now asking that question

990
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,280
and then immediately I thought wait a

991
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,359
second

992
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,540
that question actually is a gift

993
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,119
a gift to me and maybe a gift to you to

994
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,680
help you think about well when you give

995
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,240
that briefing and you communicate to

996
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,680
someone here's the status

997
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,660
how can we make sure that they get it if

998
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,400
their head is nodding okay I see the

999
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,900
risk is going up and we should probably

1000
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,099
do something about the risk going up or

1001
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,599
hey the risk is going down good thing

1002
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,680
you're doing the things you're doing

1003
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,960
what's that feedback loop that we can

1004
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,820
get from them that maybe when we think

1005
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,980
about questions like this

1006
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,920
when I leave Cheryl's office

1007
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,280
what do I want her to do or to know or

1008
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,800
to carry with her as she carries cyber

1009
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,980
with her to lead the team of really

1010
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,480
important people doing really important

1011
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,619
things

1012
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,960
not just the interaction but is there a

1013
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,300
message hey when you go to tea briefing

1014
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,980
if you can let everyone know hey be

1015
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,720
really careful about

1016
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,800
whatever

1017
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,720
or be aware of

1018
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,220
or you know what it's been a while sure

1019
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,839
would you remind everyone when they see

1020
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,520
something here's how they want them to

1021
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,960
say something here's a slide put it in

1022
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,400
your deck and you can just go through it

1023
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,680
and brief your team that would be

1024
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,599
fantastic

1025
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,780
and it would be fantastic

1026
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:30,560
so what's the wisdom in this lesson

1027
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,359
this one's interesting this one's tough

1028
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,660
on a bunch of different levels

1029
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,820
the job I had before I was privileged to

1030
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,240
be to see so at the Atlanta fed

1031
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,760
my boss my Elite immediate leader was

1032
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,380
the Chief Information Security Officer

1033
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,460
of the company

1034
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,619
it was a he said I'll use he I won't say

1035
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,940
his name because that would be cool but

1036
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,300
my boss he said to me hey Russell I know

1037
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,099
you moved to Atlanta you want to be a

1038
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,480
cyber security leader you want to be a

1039
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,420
CSO and as you know I understand so I'm

1040
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,460
like yeah

1041
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,140
but he asked me a question I wasn't

1042
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,180
prepared for and usually when I get big

1043
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,040
questions I like to sleep on them I find

1044
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,420
when I kind of walk away from a

1045
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,920
situation kind of think about something

1046
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,839
else and then come back I've got a

1047
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,700
really good answer but I knew I could

1048
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,020
not do that

1049
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,560
for my boss to see so of a company I had

1050
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,420
several years ago

1051
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,280
and his question was this

1052
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,560
Russell I know you want to be ciso if

1053
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,839
you were in my chair and I was in your

1054
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,760
chair like literally in his office so we

1055
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,520
were like swamp rolls what advice would

1056
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,720
you give me

1057
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,300
oh that's a tough one because if I say

1058
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,099
something terrible

1059
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,540
I'm gone

1060
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,820
if I say something that's not very smart

1061
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,560
and intellectual

1062
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,400
maybe I'm gone then too what do I say

1063
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,140
and with about three seconds like a

1064
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,320
deep breath it hit me

1065
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,200
here's what I said I said to my boss hey

1066
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,700
you know I can't see all the details of

1067
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,020
your calendar but it's not about that I

1068
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,000
don't know don't change anything

1069
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,859
but if I could see the details of your

1070
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,859
calendar comma boss's name I would ask

1071
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,180
you this question what's the percentage

1072
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,380
of time that you're here in our

1073
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,480
department very big very influential

1074
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,560
Department

1075
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,140
versus the amount of time that you're

1076
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,320
say at someone else's staff meeting or

1077
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,720
team meeting or audit committee out in

1078
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,880
the proverbial community of our

1079
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,500
organization versus being in the

1080
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,079
community of our security team I think

1081
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,320
my answer to you comma my boss's name is

1082
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,359
that's the advice I would give you and I

1083
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,000
felt good about that oh I survived uh

1084
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,520
that was kind of a little sweats I was

1085
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,380
like oh that was a little tense for me

1086
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,839
an interesting approach but here's why

1087
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,060
that story matters

1088
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,940
because when I got in the chair for the

1089
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,380
first time

1090
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,599
when I got to be the CSO at the Atlanta

1091
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,160
fed

1092
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,380
what do you think what memory replayed

1093
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,780
in my mind

1094
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,060
it was that memory

1095
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,099
they said when my boss who knew I wanted

1096
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,020
to be ciso said what advice do you have

1097
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,060
for me Russell and I said here's my

1098
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,040
advice for you comma my boss's name at

1099
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,599
that place

1100
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,119
it hit me

1101
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,420
and integrity is really important to me

1102
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,000
and it's important to you too

1103
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,060
it hit me harder than the words I said

1104
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,099
to my boss back then

1105
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,099
hey Russell let me see your calendar how

1106
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,660
much time are you spending in the

1107
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,060
department doing cyber things cheering

1108
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,859
for mentoring leading coaching all the

1109
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,619
verbs that are necessary versus how much

1110
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:41,180
time am I spending in Cheryl's office

1111
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,440
how much time am I spending with my

1112
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,240
peers

1113
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,060
those who have equal responsibility but

1114
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,160
for different functional units how much

1115
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,859
time am I spending there

1116
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,680
all right how much time is your CSO

1117
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,260
spending is there is there a magic ratio

1118
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,020
is it 50 50 I don't know is it 75 25 is

1119
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,920
it 25.75

1120
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,920
whatever it is I just imagine making it

1121
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,500
one notch better

1122
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,780
could benefit everyone your CSA was

1123
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,000
privileged to lead

1124
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,920
so if I was to think about what are some

1125
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,599
things that maybe if you wanted to go in

1126
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:20,099
and apply or take action on the things

1127
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,240
that I've talked about those thing

1128
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,500
number one thing number two thing number

1129
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,920
three

1130
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,980
foreign I think it's not necessary it

1131
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,619
shouldn't be the case it seems unfair

1132
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,660
for you to wonder what in the world

1133
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,980
rattles around in the mind of somebody

1134
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,420
who leads people that leads people that

1135
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,099
does Cyber things

1136
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,660
even if they used to do those very

1137
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,800
things

1138
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,540
in former careers

1139
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,940
great resource here a link is shown

1140
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,859
there from rafikus a CSO mind map

1141
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,359
actually learned about this just a few

1142
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,060
weeks ago this idea of what it's a chart

1143
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,400
the link is it's an ad chart that says

1144
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,380
what are the sections and the categories

1145
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,300
and the things that csos need to worry

1146
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,960
about things such as a budget is one of

1147
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,319
those things

1148
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,819
strategic planning is one of those

1149
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:06,599
things

1150
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,780
the business the real reason our company

1151
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,599
exists Nordstrom reason

1152
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:17,280
is there governance how the function of

1153
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,780
cyber

1154
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,599
operates how you govern it the policies

1155
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,579
are in place the directives that your

1156
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,220
team issues out extraordinary resource

1157

00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,780
that lead people that do cyber things

1164
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,359
so the rest of my story

1165
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,400
again after taking a deep breath in my

1166
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,680
boss's office amazing facilities if you

1167
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,180
ever get a chance to go highly recommend

1168
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,680
literally takes up a whole city block

1169
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,440
amazing

1170
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,540
I shifted from

1171
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,980
I have to go to work

1172
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,900
so I get to go do a whole bunch of cool

1173
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,940
things instead of just focusing on one

1174
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,160
super important organization I have now

1175
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,040
the privilege to go help be the CSO for

1176
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,500
a bunch of organization maybe smaller

1177
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,700
organizations that don't have the

1178
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,780
ability or the knowledge or the

1179
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,339
budget to have someone full time maybe

1180
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:22,200
every Monday this company maybe Tuesday

1181
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,700
that company and just that that

1182
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,920
experience to say here's

1183
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,720
what can help your company go further

1184
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,160
faster

1185
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,660
help several folks be able to get there

1186
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,339
for ciso job that's just amazing pants

1187
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:35,280
I'll never forget when I was appointed

1188
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,319
the CIO it means I had to work on a plan

1189
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:39,660
to make someone be and appoint them as

1190
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,300
the ciso and the career highlight for me

1191
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,619
in my five and a half years of being

1192
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,300
there was not getting promoted twice and

1193
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,280
getting exposed to some wicked cool

1194
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,020
smart things and people

1195
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,780
and just extraordinary

1196
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,880
but when I got to reach out my hand and

1197
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,319
invite

1198
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:58,920

1199
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,720

year now see so the company

1203
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,020
transferring responsibility over I miss

1204
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,520
it it was tough

1205
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,740
but he earned it and he got it and the

1206
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,359
board all approved and I got to deliver

1207
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,339
that message that was the highlight of

1208
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,680
my fed career is to be able to put

1209
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,540
someone in position to be able to assume

1210
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,579
that and leading the same magic team

1211
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,740
doing some really cool things and

1212
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,180
cheering for him the whole way because

1213
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,619
of the importance they have of what we

1214
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,000
do

1215
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,040
that was my highlight

1216
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,020
getting to learn something new every

1217
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,880
single day

1218
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,560
every single day

1219
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,440
and like today tomorrow yesterday a

1220
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,119
whole bunch of things that we all get to

1221
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,859
learn to make us the best version of

1222
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:46,680
ourself to get to share my story with

1223
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,540
you today the what in the world was

1224
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,160
going on in Russell's mind when he

1225
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,140
thought the days days before the

1226
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,339
pandemic would be a great day to start

1227
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:55,440
your own business

1228
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,359
flying solo

1229
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,800
I know that I've got everything I need

1230
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,220
to grow my business because I believe

1231
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,800
that every single CSO every single

1232
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,839
director every single manager every

1233
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,700
single individual contributor person in

1234
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,099
cyber security can make an impact on the

1235
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,619
organization especially when

1236
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:17,280
they understand why the company exists

1237
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,900
I believe

1238
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,359
um those of you know me uh I'm

1239
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,420
extraordinarily optimistic I can see the

1240
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,760
good and terrible nasty things that just

1241
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,000
how I was raised I also have this belief

1242
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,460
that eventually we can move cyber if you

1243
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,660
think of a balance sheet where you got

1244
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,200
assets and liabilities and a column here

1245
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,819
liabilities of paying I.T and cyber

1246
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,040
security we've got our assets of maybe

1247
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,859
customer growth acquisition extra

1248
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,200
revenue for the company I've got this

1249
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,980
belief that someday cyber can be an

1250
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,079
asset someday cyber can help the

1251
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,240
business go further and go faster

1252
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,160
someday to Nordstrom

1253
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,839
can look at its mission statement and

1254
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,060
says we're better off at Nordstrom

1255
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,400
because the Cyber team whoever works at

1256
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,900
Cyber team at Nordstrom is doing the

1257
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,520
things that they're doing we're not

1258
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,540
there yet

1259
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,240
but I think by focusing on things that

1260
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,980
matter and things that rattle around in

1261
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,599
the mind of those who have the privilege

1262
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:13,980
to lead people that lead people to do

1263
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,240
cyber things

1264
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,119
can make that type of impact

1265
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:19,800
I really appreciate you spending time

1266
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,880

1267
