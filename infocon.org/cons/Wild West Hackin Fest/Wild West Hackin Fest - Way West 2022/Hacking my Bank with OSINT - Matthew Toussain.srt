1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,839
foreign

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,240
no we are doing the news if anyone

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,179
watches the news uh phis webcast we're

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,460
doing it at 7 p.m in uh track one

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,520
there's a talk that canceled so

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,699
it'll be more of this but worse

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,039
but better I'm sorry I'm not good at

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,060
marketing this would be way better

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,279
I've known Matt for a long time we met

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,719
approximately 16 hours ago so a lifetime

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,219
there's not anything more that you could

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,920
possibly want to know about me

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,360
I am shallow in the extreme

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,980
I mean you'll hear about the supposedly

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,079
publicly disclose your bank account how

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
to hack it I am actually my my password

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,820
is literally going to be on a slide yup

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,879
all right so welcome uh this is let's

19
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,680
see what is this talk

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,800
hacking my bank with osent ocent I know

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,020
what that means that's really awesome so

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,640
this is Matt how do you pronounce your

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,580
last name Matt Hussein Hussein uh he's

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,760
going to be talking about how you can

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,900
hack his bank actually just gonna

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,880
explain it uh to give him a little bit

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,400
of background about Matt he is a Sans

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,220
person he's affiliated with Sans also we

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,540
used to have really long hair and a long

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,360
beard and then everything changed

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,580
that's his intro so that's my intro good

32
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,920
luck enjoy

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,200
here we go welcome everyone had a good

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,299
Wild West hack Fest so far yes no maybe

35
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,299
yeah you do the Caesar thumb over here

36

first timers nice welcome wow a lot of

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,159
folks welcome that is awesome I know

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,659
with the new cyber security conferences

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,159
you can always be a little daunting you

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,720
don't necessarily know people here so if

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,759
you don't know anyone come say hi to me

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,680
I'll introduce myself to you watch I

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,540
think I just did that subscribe to that

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,979
part introduce yourself to me I'll

46
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,720
introduce you around the table it would

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,579
be my pleasure to make your Wildlife

48
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,140
Experience just that much better I think

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,640
John the team at Black Hills do an

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,500
amazing job with this so anything I can

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,780
do to service that as well

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,939
more the merrier any case without

53
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,699
further Ado quick PSA on this talk I am

54
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,959
going to be doing a number or

55
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,220
demonstrating anyway a number of

56
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,780
techniques that are almost universally

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,080
illegal to do

58
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,760
but I'm gonna do them to myself because

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,040
I'm a masochist

60
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,020
from your perspective though please

61
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,640
don't try to use the information that

62
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,680
you might see here directly against uh

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,000
say look to your left look to your right

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,280
those people don't do that that's called

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,420
a felony

66
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,920
two big benefits that we're going to get

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,660
from this talk though the first one is

68
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,739
it's really important for us to

69
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,480
understand what the art of the possible

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,700
is going to be for adversaries right for

71
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,340
the bad folks out there if they were

72
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,800
perhaps a little bit better at being bad

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,959
it turns out that adversarial techniques

74
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,300
aren't necessarily the most

75
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,019
sophisticated even though we call them

76
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,660
the APT but if they were a little bit

77
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,340
more sophisticated they might do things

78
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,720
like we're going to talk about here it's

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,220
important for us to know on the other

80
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,900
hand though the techniques can be used

81
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,760
in a professional context as well I have

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
done so when performing things like

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,599
incident response or threat hunting

84
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,040
specifically these tend to be quite

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,860
useful when doing attribution type of

86
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,900
work without further Ado though let's

87
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,879
Dive Right In so we're gonna do a bank

88
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,319
job that's right we're going to hack a

89
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,780
bank and any good bank job starts with a

90
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,700
hustle with that hustle we want to pick

91
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,760
a schmuck exhibit a next we want to get

92
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,620
his details his information and finally

93
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,500
we want to take that cache because poor

94
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,200
men do not afford Lamborghinis and I

95
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,300
need a purple Lamborghini on the side oh

96
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,120
right so let's actually make ourselves a

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
to-do list on what we need to have in

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
order to be successful at accomplishing

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
this gig first off if you log into your

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,700
bank account what information do you

101
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,799
need to present to that system well you

102
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,500
got a username yeah passwords okay so

103
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,480
far so good you probably know what bank

104
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,980
account you're using for us that's

105
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,180
probably pretty self-evident because you

106
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,440
know what you bank with but if we're

107
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,940
going after a schmuck we don't

108
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,980
necessarily have that answer we want to

109
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,620
find that information out too okay and

110
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,560
then finally two-factor authentication

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,720
MFA might be something that we have to

112
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,940
deal with if applicable we may need to

113
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,920
bypass that as well can we find the

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,019
answers to all of these online oh let's

115
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,720
take a look shall we step one pick that

116
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,420
schmuck that is me schmuck Target poser

117
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,699
I don't really look like that anymore so

118
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,978
you can call me a catfish as well that

119
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,979
works it's all good in the hood now when

120
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,120
we start looking at this kind of

121
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,699
information

122
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,199
we have to understand is that open

123
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,460
source intelligence gathering

124
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,280
reconnaissance are actually discrete

125
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,440
services in information security they

126
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,820
absolutely are

127
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,440
that means while you might have done a

128
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,580
little bit of reconnaissance as part of

129
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,800
a penetration test you're probably not

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,199
thinking about this as a full stack

131
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,240
engagement because most folks who've

132
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,340
done reconnaissance work normally it's a

133
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,080
little module here a little module there

134
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,580
in support of a vulnerability assessment

135
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,680
a penetration test red teaming All That

136
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,040
Jazz but in this discipline there is

137
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,380
actually methodology associated with end

138
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,960
to end as well and this typically begins

139
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,199
with what we refer to in the biz as seed

140
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,639
information right where you're going to

141
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,280
start from to grow your understanding of

142
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,500
your target now that might be an

143
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,479
Enterprise in the case of Enterprises

144
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,979
there's often a couple Frameworks you

145
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,479
may use to perform a little bit of this

146
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,419
things like multigo or spider foot and

147
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,220
the typical seed that we're using for

148
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,020
something like that is a domain name

149
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,400
right maybe it is b-h-i-s dot Co

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,860
that's their website yes I'm absolutely

151
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,600
here on stage talking about the people

152
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,340
who put this thing on and evaluating

153
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,680
their attack surface John please invite

154
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,300
me back

155
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,860
in any case if I look that up bhs.co or

156
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,180
blackhillsinfosec.com evidently they

157
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,539
couldn't get the bhas.com

158
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:47,100
unfortunate unfortunate and we looked

159
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,259
that up we can take that information and

160
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,800
we can transform it into other data if

161
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,419
it's a name for instance we could

162
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,180
perhaps do a resolution of that name to

163
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,820
IP address or IPv6 address right ip4

164
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,460
IPv6 NS lookup might do that for us so

165
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,840
taking one piece of information and

166
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,699
transforming it into another

167
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,320
all right what if we have an ipv4

168
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,699
address can we transform that into more

169
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,620
information absolutely perhaps you go to

170
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,699
something like a regional internet

171
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,340
registry an rir

172
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,740
any ipv4 address or IPv6 address it is

173
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,320
routable on the internet has to exist in

174
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,820
one of these Registries for North

175
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,039
America that would be Aaron if we go to

176
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,900
Aaron and we look up that ipv4 address

177
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,880
we will then get a huge list of

178
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,620
information about The Entity that

179
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,060
registered it to be things like their

180
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,759
email addresses it's going to be uh the

181
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,500
location where they physically reside

182
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,380
mailing addresses Network blocks of IP

183
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,780
addresses that are also associated with

184
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,759
that same entity and related to the

185
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,280
block that we have just looked up a lot

186
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,020
of information we can then transform

187
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,000
every bit and piece of that into even

188
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,319
more however in our case our Target is

189
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,419
not really an Enterprise it's a schmuck

190
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,180
he's me so our seed in this case is

191
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,680
going to be a name

192
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,620
just a person's name can we transform

193
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,139
that into more data absolutely that is

194
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,240
the battle song of Open Source

195
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,100
intelligence gathering that is what it

196
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,780
is all about

197
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,100
now one little thing on this one here

198
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,840
real quick generally speaking if you've

199
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,280
got a Target that you want to go after

200
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,720
you probably know who they are probably

201
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,460
know the name what if you don't know the

202
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,259
name for example we got any gamers in

203
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,280
the house

204
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,840
yeah let's say you're playing League of

205
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,460
Legends right you're going down the lane

206
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,020
I'm using words that I have no idea what

207
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,940
they mean you're going down the lane and

208
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,259
you're killing everyone left right and

209
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,180
center but then somebody starts just

210
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,120
bashing you yep over and over again

211
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,280
kills uh what do you call it kill uh I

212
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,900
don't know waiting for you to Res and

213
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,099
then killing you again whatever that's

214
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,199
called yes and you're like I'm not

215
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,639
having a good day anymore I want to know

216
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,919
exactly who that 12 year old kid is so I

217
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,380
can send his parents some nasty emails

218
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,960
can we find that out well yeah

219
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
absolutely we can put him in a Timeout

220
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,759
globally yes

221
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,560
but what's our seed information in that

222
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,460
case

223
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,900
it's not their name hopefully they

224
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,280
didn't make their username their actual

225
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,380
name like oof a little bit of opsec

226
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,160
there

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
but it is a username right so it might

228
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,840
be a uid can we transform a uid yes we

229
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,699
can transfer my pv4 addresses we can

230
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,440
transform people's names we can

231
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,660
transform new IDs the question simply is

232
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,520
what transformation we're performing and

233
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,560
where can we look that up honestly the

234
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,240
easiest way to do this is to start with

235
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,940
Google in almost all cases yes I know

236
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,379
basic

237
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,139
but it does work so here you Google my

238
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,780
name turns out that I'm super popular oh

239
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,000
yeah you Google my name and every result

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,700
that pops up right off the bat is me oh

241
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,599
yeah

242
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,279
make sure you misspell your kid's name

243
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,360
on the birth certificate because then

244
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,299
they'll SEO like I do yeah my name is

245
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,799
misspelled my grandfather didn't know

246
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,179
how to spell his own name oops

247
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,120
unfortunate

248
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,580
PL really really well

249
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,839
tessio let's say your name is Michael

250
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,560
Stone way to be basic Michael Stone gosh

251
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,540
basic name right there you should be

252
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,399
cool like me because then it's easy for

253
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
the hackers to come at you yeah it turns

254
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,260
out that security by obscurity is rather

255
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,360
successful it's actually quite good I

256
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,339
know we have a big bad rap for it in the

257
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,640
infosec community because it's like a

258
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,440
matter of time until it gets overlooked

259
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,000
or it doesn't get overlooked and

260
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,980
suddenly you're pwned that doesn't seem

261
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,360
very good that doesn't seem very safe

262
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,060
but it turns out that risk is likelihood

263
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,279
times impact and if your results don't

264
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,019
show up until Google's search result

265
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,500
number 155 that likelihood does

266
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,839
absolutely go down and mathematically

267
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,700
that means the risk does too it is

268
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,880
absolutely a mathematical truth

269
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,540
so way to be basic good job good job but

270
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,040
if you are there are of course ways

271
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,899
around this too for example one of the

272
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,459
searches that we may want to do isn't

273
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,500
just looking for professional and

274
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,459
personal

275
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,980
sites and information sources on our

276
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,019
Target but what if we click on this

277
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,180
image search thing

278
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,880
it turns out that people are really good

279
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,399
at recognizing other people computers

280
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,200
suck at this they're really terrible I

281
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,720
mean I know we've got all of this ml AI

282
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
driven let's even get some more

283
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,699
buzzwords here right Big Data uh

284
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,620
I don't know if you do blockchain in

285
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,600
this but yes we need blockchain nfts

286
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
it's images nfts non-fungible pictures

287
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,899
yes I'm selling all of these nfts by the

288
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,279
way if you'd like to uh if you'd like to

289
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,200
purchase one just hit me up afterwards

290
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,540
uh we'll make it happen I I take I

291
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,160
accept payment in both Bitcoin and

292
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,839
especially I'll give you a discount if

293
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,140
it's Dogecoin oh yes oh yes but the

294
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,120
point is if we look up image searches

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,140
you're probably going to be able to

296
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,760
recognize your target better than a

297
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,740
computer cam this is particularly useful

298
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,540
if our Target doesn't SEO very well

299
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,700
because if we click on any one of these

300
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,339
images oh no my zoom feature broke

301
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,519
that's unfortunate oh

302
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,740
there it is it was just off screen nice

303
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,360
so if you click on any one of these

304
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,040
images yes I know they're all terrible

305
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,480
you click on any one of these images

306
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,459
it's going to show you where that was

307
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,959
listed on the internet

308
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,339
that gives you a site where you know

309
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,000
there's going to be some information

310
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,860
about your target that's useful but

311
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,600
here's where it gets really interesting

312
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,700
reverse image search

313
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,579
save that image Google the image itself

314
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,560
and you're going to be able to find not

315
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,560
just the page that SEO is well but

316
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,959
anywhere else the user reuse that images

317
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,380
see pictures selfies are a lot like

318
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,779
passwords people make one and they use

319
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,380
it everywhere yep reuse absolutely this

320
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,380
means that we can find the not very high

321
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,180
in the search results Pages by doing

322
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,160
this for example let's say that Michael

323
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,720
Stone Basic happens to a volunteer at a

324
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,459
youth soccer program with his daughter

325
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,500
that's probably not going to SEO all

326
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,300
that high but if there's pictures on

327
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,980
that website we do reverse image search

328
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,500
suddenly found it and that can be

329
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,120
particularly useful

330
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,200
let's take a look at some of this

331
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,339
information oh yeah one other thing on

332
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:51,540
this

333
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,800
we're going to be trying to get in my

334
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
bank right we're trying to get into a

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,279
bank any kind of institution all of

336
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,720
these things have workarounds for

337
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,459
authentication because they need to be

338
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,260
able to provide services

339
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,600
regardless of what you messed up

340
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,760
let's say that I have two-fact

341
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,040
Authentication

342
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,800
and I oops lost my phone well that sucks

343
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,360
really unfortunate

344
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,240
well can I get into my bank now

345
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,100
no does my bank have a workaround for

346
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,279
this absolutely absolutely they all do

347
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,720
and there are a couple ways where they

348
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,579
might do this but one of the common ones

349
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,860
that you may see is this where they say

350
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,880
okay you don't know anything about

351
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,680
yourself but we still need to prove that

352
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,820
you are you

353
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,860
so take a picture of yourself

354
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,680
with some kind of known identification

355
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,779
card like a driver's license or a

356
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,700
password passport in the same picture

357
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,320
and we'll use that for identification

358
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,000
verification it's very very common

359
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,740
workaround in the case of two-fact

360
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,019
authentication systems being lost

361
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,459
how do they know it's been lost because

362
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,260
you told them so this doesn't mean that

363
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,880
it's a real user an attacker can

364
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,440
actually get to the step too and guess

365
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,600
what Photoshop is useful for yes can we

366
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,220
Photoshop all this absolutely what about

367
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,420
a driver's license does the information

368
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,800
need to be real

369
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,100
no if I am Bank of America I cannot look

370
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,660
up a driver's license in a government

371
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,240
registry I am not the FBI we can fake

372
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,220
all of that information just like our

373
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,620
fake IDs that we got when we're 20 right

374
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,040
yeah oh yes just me oh shoot yeah we can

375
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,019
fake that this is identity identity

376
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,820
verification but in this case we are

377
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,459
manufacturing that so images very very

378
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,800
useful to collect for our Target because

379
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,839
then we can manufacture the identity

380
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,940
verification presuming that we even need

381
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,139
this we might be able to find all the

382
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,579
information out there and just straight

383
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,740
log in but sometimes we may need to

384
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,920
bypass a defense and there's no weaker

385
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,139
system than the human when you call them

386
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:38,639
up

387
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,440
so we go to that information you'll see

388
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,660
that uh person so today has been in the

389
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,860
Air Force you can tell by the stunner

390
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,839
shades excuse me aviators and the bomber

391
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,820
jacket I'm really cool oh yeah by the

392
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,740
way really cool then he went works at

393
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,240
this little company called bhis I think

394
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,800
they do infosec but I don't know for

395
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,360
sure probably don't do a very good job

396
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,060
of it though huh that's why I left which

397
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,019
Sans

398
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,880
uh became his course author for sands on

399
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,620
the vulnerability assessment side and

400
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,540
then I moved over to open security which

401
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,100
company I founded to do all this kind of

402
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,899
work pretty similar to Black Hills

403
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,300
itself all right

404
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,940
well then 2020 happened

405
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,760
and I went ahead and decided you know

406
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,740
let's go ahead and fund that image

407
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,920
search good luck with that one Google

408
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,579
heck when I shaved from oh shoot

409
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,880
uh oh there we go when I shaved from

410
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,839
this Paragon of human existence to this

411
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,660
mistake my phone didn't recognize me oh

412
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,319
snap

413
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,860
yeah

414
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,360
I don't know what's going on with it

415
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,100
laptop says he work is fine

416
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,740
let's try this one more time actually

417
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,440
instead let's not use the peripheral

418
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,480
this is how you can tell I'm a real

419
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
hacker

420
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,360
these real hackers never work well with

421
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,720
PowerPoint

422
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,339
um

423
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,899
just don't know that that's me in this

424
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,019
case

425
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,740
perfect you got it

426
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,980
physical layer

427
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,360
all right so I'm gonna need you two to

428
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,139
hold your breath

429
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,279
okay there we go

430
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,639
Zoom feature maybe where

431
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,820
it follows the mouse so

432
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,100
there we go okay awesome yeah sometimes

433
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,620
when it happened and then I had a cyber

434
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,760
Jesus phase

435
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,800
yeah yeah that's a real picture

436
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,160
taken in uh bc1

437
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,100
yeah bc1 yeah real picture for sure and

438
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,199
uh so dude gets around has a lot of

439
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,820
different websites lots of different

440
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,800
pictures okay so far so good we got a

441
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,420
little bit of that but the question that

442
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,980
we need to ask next

443
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,720
how do we exploit this right it's fine

444
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,959
and dandy uh he's got a uh

445
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,060
a bit of a hair problem okay but how can

446
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,399
we use that against them to achieve our

447
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,579
nefarious intent the answer

448
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,800
is follow yellow brick road we now know

449
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,540
some professional associations with this

450
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,240
individual he has Black Hills credos

451
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,940
open security and Sands these are all

452
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,399
companies they all likely have email

453
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,940
systems right okay with email there's

454
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,860
something you can do in basically every

455
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,320
situation that you may encounter that is

456
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,060
going to be here

457
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,760
guess and check enumeration oh no this

458
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,519
one I actually do need it for

459
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,620
oh technical difficulties will not stop

460
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,160
will they

461
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,860
I'll just talk to it

462
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,440
so here I'm typing in a legitimate email

463
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,259
address this is Matt

464
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,820
blackhillsinfosec.com and what happens

465
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,860
next is Google says okay what password

466
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,360
do you want to type in that makes sense

467
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,740
right type an email address then you

468
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,240
type in your password but what happens

469
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,720
if I type in the wrong email address

470
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
it presents us with a verbose error

471
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,699
response and it says we couldn't find

472
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,619
your Google account

473
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,220
hmm so we can tell if we got the right

474
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,339
email address or if we don't

475
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,500
and there are two major email systems

476
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,319
for both personal use as well as

477
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,839
business use that is Microsoft and

478
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,699
Google workspace

479
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,020
in this case we can tell that black

480
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,600
hills uses Google workspace oh shoot am

481
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,640
I enumerating more attack surface from

482
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,799
Black Hills please invite me back John

483
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,340
yeah okay so this works can we do a

484
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,660
little bit more with that absolutely

485
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,640
here's mail sniper Mill sniper is a

486
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,679
Powershell utility written by Beau book

487
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,020
at Black Hills absolutely amazing tool

488
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,360
amazing Tool uh recently it's had a lot

489
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,520
more development on it too which I'm

490
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,440
very pleased with because Bo is

491
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,059
absolutely terrible at accepting pull

492
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,460
requests yes the community is updating

493
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,380
his tool Forum or making adjustments or

494
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,539
improving it those things sit in Bose

495
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,880
queue for two years three years just ask

496
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,880
me mine sat for three years yes but

497
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,080
there's some poor people involved with

498
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,640
the project now as well who are

499
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,320
modernizing it very heavily it's

500
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,460
fantastic if you haven't seen male

501
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,740
sniper recently I highly recommend you

502
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,140
go check it out this tool is great how

503
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,480
does it work though well

504
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,640
let's get those Deets shall we

505
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,260
this is a male sniper

506
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,240
in this case I'm looking at a list of

507
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
potential email addresses and I feed

508
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,080
them in a male sniper and mail sniper

509
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,559
automates this bit and tells me exactly

510
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,380
which ones are real mail sniper has

511
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,840
support for ews and owa it's Microsoft

512
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,059
stuff and it also has support for a G

513
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,000
suite for business Google workspace now

514
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,460
all this rebranding stuff right so it

515
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,780
supports both regardless of which one

516
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,700
you've got you can use mail sniper in

517
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,400
order to get those email addresses which

518
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,740
is our first step as we start to collect

519
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,080
this information we want to put it in

520
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,460
our mind map right we want to collect

521
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,860
the information and we want to store it

522
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,200
and remember what we've got because this

523
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,940
is what we're going to now transform

524
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,860
against as well

525
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,539
so next step what about the personal

526
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,299
this was business I got that we get the

527
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,220
domain names from that Google search we

528
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,840
see what organizations associated with

529
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,120
pop in a male sniper what about personal

530
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,100
accounts we can get a lot of information

531
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,600
from personal accounts as well boom

532
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
what else can we do what else can we do

533
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,720
here

534
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,419
companies we so far have used it to get

535
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:28,919
email addresses but what if we actually

536
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,440
went in to that website and saw what it

537
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,940
said this might be things like press

538
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,620
releases where the individual's name

539
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,840
tends to be uh be put into it might be a

540
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,280
Blog might be a uh a biography it might

541
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,780
be their LinkedIn account but back to

542
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,720
the uh the socials with all kinds of

543
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,860
information about where they've been

544
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,360
what they've done where they went to the

545
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,940
university and so forth

546
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,820
we can also use database searches to

547
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,340
enrich that information even more there

548
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,780
are a couple of these out there one's

549
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,240
people it's pipl another one is what you

550
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,700
see on the screen here this is Spokeo uh

551
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,039
Spokeo and people they essentially just

552
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,980
search public databases of information

553
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,960
there's some more things they do there's

554
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,820
some correlation on top of that but by

555
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,660
and large if you want to think about

556
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,580
these tools is they look for publicly

557
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,440
accessible information that means we

558
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,900
could open all of this manually if we so

559
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,700
choose but a tool like this will

560
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,919
automate that and make it happen quite a

561
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,220
lot faster which is very very handy

562
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,140
in this case if you look at this you're

563
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,460
going to find information about myself

564
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,100
my father and my mother thank you Spokeo

565
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,620
for seoing those perfectly

566
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,179
you're also going to see addresses here

567
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,280
the exact addresses of where I have

568
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,960
perhaps lived and if you look at the top

569
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,640
left hand corner of the screen you'll

570
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,220
even see it on a map and it seems like I

571
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,100
may have lived in Alaska in Texas and

572
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,860
perhaps in Washington state as well this

573
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,059
is all going to be extremely useful

574
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,820
information for us to transform into

575
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,679
more data that we can use to log into

576
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,880
the bank

577
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,220
so when it comes to finding personal

578
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,200
email accounts which is generally

579
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,880
speaking what we need to log into the

580
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,679
bank though a lot of people do use their

581
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,539
professional email as their Bank login

582
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,860
as well they just use that one email

583
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,720
there are also a ton of people out there

584
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,640
who just use an AOL account so they got

585
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,620
back in 1999 when the world is about to

586
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,660
end and they just didn't didn't do

587
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,340
anything past that like nothing at all

588
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,600
yeah guess what their password is

589
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,780
hey well probably probably I was going

590
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,280
to go with password but the same idea

591
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,840
holds true yes if it's an AOL account

592
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,140
almost guaranteed the password is

593
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,400
unfortunate as in if you want to

594
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,960
continue with the rest of the step do so

595
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,820
because you choose to not because you

596
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,460
need to yeah but in this case my name

597
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,280
happens to be pretty you know unique and

598
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,280
so my email is just m2sane very easy to

599
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,919
guess but Michael Stone on the other

600
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,460
hand might be something like M Stone 35s

601
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,539
this makes it a little bit more

602
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,640
challenging but there are tons and tons

603
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,919
of ways to uncover personal email

604
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,380
accounts particularly if the person that

605
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,500
we are targeting happens to be in it or

606
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,020
a developer or in security because we

607
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,159
interact with a lot of information

608
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,380
systems and those information systems

609
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,659
interact with other information systems

610
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,940
they just slap data around for example

611
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,340
here's a GitHub project that I wrote

612
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,500
Once Upon A Time In fact I wrote this on

613
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,200
Google code and remember Google code

614
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,020
good good you've done yourself a favor

615
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,760
here yeah that thing's been defunct for

616
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,320
a decade but it needed to move over to

617
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,360
GitHub because GitHub back then was just

618
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,260
coming up and it went ahead and Google

619
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,120
told the world what my personal email

620
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,500
addresses

621
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,700
yep absolutely that's 2014. well I guess

622
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,880
it's 2015. oh no it's 2013. geez that's

623
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,100
been a while yeah so that's out there

624
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,200
forever absolutely is and this is the

625
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,520
kind of thing that you have to

626
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,140
understand about your personal email

627
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,419
accounts security by obscurity is likely

628
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,039
not going to be able to defend you or

629
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,480
help you out there particularly if

630
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,760
you've used the internet a lot and to do

631
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,020
more things and log into your AOL

632
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,640
account right if you've done more than

633
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,159
that then there's more attack surface as

634
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,620
well here's just an intriguing example

635
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,659
but any system could do this any system

636
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,460
could do this

637
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,559
so now we've identified more information

638
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,419
about our Target we want to map that

639
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:13,980
information as well because we're going

640
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,020
to keep this mind map going and building

641
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,000
and so we are confident that we can be

642
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,580
successful in our bank job

643
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,280
we've got email addresses now but what

644
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,640
about those passwords

645
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,080
yeah we still need those that's where

646
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,820
things really start to get fun isn't it

647
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,679
let's give ourselves some passwords the

648
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,120
first and easiest way you may go about

649
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,760
acquiring credentials for a Target is

650
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,679
through a technique known as credential

651
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,659
stuffing credential stuffing is

652
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:42,240
extremely powerful and it is extremely

653
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,820
easy to do like extremely easy to do

654
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,559
these days if I'm doing a penetration

655
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,260
test or a red team I am generally armed

656
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,000
with real credentials for the real

657
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,580
organization before I have started the

658
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,900
test at all

659
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,020
why credential stuffing what credential

660
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,900
stuffing essentially is is breach data

661
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,659
weaponized against your organization you

662
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,419
see we create accounts on all kinds of

663
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:07,919
different systems cohere has a LinkedIn

664
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,880
account

665
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,320
oh I'm sorry I probably have your

666
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,880
password

667
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,740
why well LinkedIn was breached LinkedIn

668
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,080
was breached really really badly and

669
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,159
they used unsalted md5 hashes to protect

670
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,500
their credentials unfortunately this is

671
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,480
very very easy to break quite easy to

672
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,580
break one round of unsalted md5 there's

673
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,080
even even rainbow tables you could use

674
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,640
against something like that and as a

675
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,200
result something like 80 to 90 percent

676
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,940
of those credentials were cracked

677
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,620
regardless of how strong your password

678
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,539
actually was

679
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:37,919
this means if you have a LinkedIn

680
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,320
account one of your passwords was

681
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,659
probably exposed in that breach and

682
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,820
that's just one breach that's just one

683
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,100
breach LinkedIn has been particularly

684
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,120
interesting specifically because

685
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,980
LinkedIn is used for professional work

686
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,020
often right that means LinkedIn is much

687
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,059
more commonly associated with your

688
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,039
professional email address so something

689
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,919
like Matt bhis.com I might have created

690
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,260
an account using that which makes it

691
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,780
even more weaponizable if you're using

692
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,880
personal email addresses for personal

693
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,520
accounts that's better that is much much

694
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,440
much better it makes credential stuffing

695
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,679
a little bit harder to perform that said

696
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
in essence it just means we have to do a

697
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,220
little bit more ocent to make the

698
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,559
credential stuffing just as powerful we

699
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,700
may want to look for more than one email

700
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,840
address in that breach data

701
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,000
all right so far so good what breach

702
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,520
data well LinkedIn okay it's probably a

703
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,260
great one but if I want to know what

704
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,480
breach data happens to have a given

705
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,159
email address in I might use a site like

706
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,080
have I been poem and if I do this for

707
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,779
myself yeah it looks like a few of those

708
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,640
email addresses have been in breaches

709
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,520
what breaches scroll down it'll tell you

710
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,720
exactly what breaches they've been in

711
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,659
LinkedIn times two thank you LinkedIn

712
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,240
absolutely why get briefs once when you

713
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,980
can get breached twice at twice the

714
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,840
price

715
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,360
you know why not so yeah here's a bundle

716
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,220
of breaches this is not even the whole

717
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,000
list

718
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,080
well certainly the whole list of

719
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,640
breaches money the whole list that

720
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,860
affected me personally what's our next

721
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,059
step

722
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,919
follow the Olympic road again right we

723
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,960
want to get this bridge data if we look

724
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,700
through that breach data we may end up

725
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,799
with credentials in the case of breach

726
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,260
data there's two general styles that we

727
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,460
will interact with in information

728
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,400
security the first is credential sets

729
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,640
and the second is raw breach data

730
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,900
a lot of folks don't realize this

731
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,100
particularly information security folks

732
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,779
when we're doing credential stuffing we

733
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,159
typically only care about email address

734
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,260
and password because that's what we want

735
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,000
to use to log in right if it exploits

736
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,299
into a user system maybe it is Windows

737
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,799
Active Directory and we're using PS

738
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,360
exact to move laterally from one host to

739
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,400
the next host we might want to try a

740
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,140
password from breach and if that

741
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,240
password is reused by that user now we

742
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,400
are in awesome we'll use that in pen

743
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,919
tests all the time however we have to

744
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,900
understand from an ocean perspective is

745
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,640
that that's only a very very small

746
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,400
amount of the actual breach data these

747
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,960
Bridge compilation lists that are only

748
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,900
using a password I've seen those go over

749
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,900
a hundred gigabytes now note this is

750
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,600
username password plain text Dot txt

751
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,659
file over a hundred gigabytes of real

752
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,080
usernames real passwords that's common

753
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,880
now how much data do you think it might

754
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,039
be if we're looking at the entirety of

755
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,720
the breach itself

756
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,640
that's going to be things like your home

757
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,799
address maybe your social security

758
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,200
number basically anything you told

759
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,779
LinkedIn or Tumblr or patreon I guess

760
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,539
like the Tumblr patreon and Linkedin all

761
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,500
of those things anything you've told

762
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,179
them about yourself whatsoever maybe

763
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,980
even your credit card information is

764
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,380
going to be in that breach data these

765
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,700
aren't the brief data sets that we often

766
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,740
use as pen testers but they definitely

767
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,240
are the reach data sets that we may want

768
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,580
to use in open source intelligence

769
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,740
gathering and here we see an example of

770
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,360
that from one of these breaches

771
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,679
I've blurred out some of the information

772
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,900
to make it a little less sensitive but

773
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,059
well you know exactly how to get it

774
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,400
Google for the bridge data find it and

775
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,140
look through it now again some of these

776
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,720
GPS data sets are so darn large that

777
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,580
opening this file even in a command line

778
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,799
editor could crash your computer they're

779
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,779
that big they're that big so you may

780
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,279
even want to consider using tools like

781
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,740
rust's grep that's RIP grep just because

782
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,419
it's more efficient it's faster and it

783
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:13,919
turns out when you're dealing with plain

784
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,900
Text data sets that are in the multiple

785
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,179
terabytes large you need that you really

786
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,980
really need that because of how much

787
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,779
data is there but essentially all we're

788
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,760
doing is we're searching through this to

789
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,860
look for information about our schmuck

790
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,240
if you didn't get the data that we want

791
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,100
we move on to the next breach and the

792
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,200
next breach and the next breach

793
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,059
in instant response I've used this

794
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,580
technique before to um

795
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,980
let's say per se get a conviction but to

796
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,260
discover a individual directly who had

797
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,200
done nefarious Insider threat attacks

798
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,880
inside of their environment this is

799
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,320
actually a hospital

800
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,120
and they called us up and they said hey

801
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,400
look we think we're breached

802
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,580
and I said um what happened the response

803
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,380
was we had 12 appointments that were

804
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,120
canceled and we don't know why these

805
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,620
appointments were canceled

806
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,120
and my response to that is I don't think

807
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,919
you're breached there's no like what is

808
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,720
the threat model here that we're talking

809
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,520
about what adversary is going to go in

810
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,840
there and have a full ability to

811
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,340
ransomware the entire organization walk

812
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,080
away with two million and instead they

813
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,020
just cancel 12 appointments like what no

814
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,880
no I don't think you're breached but

815
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,559
they told me I we really want you to

816
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,880
take a look we really want you to take a

817
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,919
look and so we did and it turned out

818
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,380
absolutely something nefarious was going

819
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,260
on but instead of the threat model I was

820
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,880
thinking about right ransomware

821
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,980
attackers from Russia the threat model

822
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,200
here was an Insider and it was actually

823
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,539
pretty sad in my opinion

824
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,700
um The Insider was just an employee of

825
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,559
this hospital and she was really really

826
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,360
getting stressed out and overworked and

827
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,100
she didn't have any PTO and she wanted

828
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,020
to take a little more time off and so

829
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,419
she did is she went into the system and

830
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,860
she canceled a bunch of appointments so

831
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,140
she got an extra day off now that's bad

832
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,820
right you can get fired for that kind of

833
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,980
thing but it's not quite illegal yet

834
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,260
here's where it got nasty

835
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,820
she didn't want to get caught

836
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,960
all right fair enough she didn't want to

837
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,700
get caught so instead of their

838
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,080
appointment cancellation system would

839
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,260
essentially SMS the uh the patient to

840
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,399
let them know their appointment has been

841
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:06,960
canceled and to reach out to schedule a

842
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,820
new one so with her Insider knowledge

843
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,899
she knows exactly what this looks like

844
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,340
knows exactly how this is going to work

845
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,720
but she doesn't want to SMS from her

846
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,220
phone because that's some very obvious

847
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,140
attribution right so she goes off and

848
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,419
registers a third-party SMF spamming

849
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,100
service anyone ever get an SMS message

850
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,059
they're trying to sell you something

851
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,120
yeah that's these Services right now is

852
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,220
that service a third party

853
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,559
yeah if you're sending patient

854
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,600
Healthcare data to a third party to SMS

855
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,240
out is that a HIPAA data breach oh yes

856
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,340
suddenly it's gotten real right suddenly

857
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,340
it's gotten very very serious

858
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,080
it was interesting though because we

859
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,700
knew what the system was where these

860
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,039
sms's would be sent out of and we could

861
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,500
tell that it had occurred there but what

862
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,059
happened is she was logged in with her

863
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,700
account and then there's a log out event

864
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,020
for looking at the event logs here in

865
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,340
this instance response there's a log out

866
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,899
event and then immediately within 10

867
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,880
seconds a login event as the local

868
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,740
administrator user yes all of their

869
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,120
users knew the local app and passwords

870
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,980
all other systems I don't recommend that

871
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,360
because then these kind of things may

872
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,760
happen and so she logs in or somebody

873
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,320
logs in as administrator this could have

874
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,700
been potentially a remote desktop login

875
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,100
or can somebody else using her PC we

876
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,120
don't have direct attribution of

877
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,940
anything yet in that login she tries to

878
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,500
send these emails out or these SMS

879
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,179
messages out but she forgot her password

880
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,120
the SMS system so now she logs into her

881
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,820
email to reset the password

882
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,760
oh snap now we have some seed

883
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,080
information that we can really pull

884
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,720
apart right but she was pretty smart

885
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,700
that email address was not associated

886
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,220
with almost anything Google for the

887
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,360
email address the only thing we're able

888
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,820
to find doing standard osent not on the

889
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,220
deep dark places in the web doing

890
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,779
standard ocean the only thing we find

891
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,260
was a Flickr account from like 2014.

892
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,779
wasn't very useful

893
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,559
we did this

894
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,059
wasn't any data breaches yes which

895
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,179
databrases oh it was actually this one

896
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:00,840
B2B yep and then we looked it up found

897
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,399
the email address in that data breach

898
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,980
got her full name

899
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,760
got her mailing address got her work

900
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,700
address got her phone number got her

901
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,200
backup phone number

902
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,760
and then found out that she's also for

903
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,559
national

904
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,360
so I very likely may have gotten someone

905
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,779
deported for that ah yikes infosec is

906
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,000
not fun is it well

907
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,299
for me it is bad person this is a lot of

908
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,220
information though right this is a ton a

909
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,559
ton of data and it is often overlooked

910
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,360
By Us in information security but it is

911
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,100
absolutely out there now is it easy to

912
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,320
find generally speaking no you see if

913
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,940
you take a breach data set like this and

914
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,159
you host it up on Google Drive

915
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,500
Google will take that down absolutely

916
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,120
because these organizations don't want

917
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,559
these data sets to be out there on the

918
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,940
internet because they are dangerous they

919
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,440
are absolutely dangerous

920
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,840
but if you put something on the Internet

921
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,179
kind of there forever right so generally

922
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,140
speaking if you're looking for these

923
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,360
kinds of data sets you might Google for

924
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,799
them you're not going to find it on the

925
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,419
first page or Google search results you

926
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,159
got to start digging and once you look

927
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,840
to your right and you see the 4chan

928
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,059
website you'll see your left and you see

929
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,279
who I don't know here conspiracy theory

930
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,020
here website right

931
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,840
after that is we're going to find that

932
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,460
breach of data download that look

933
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,980
through that and now we are off to the

934
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,340
races hmm

935
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,080
oh one of the places you can find this

936
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,539
uh touring sites torrent sites are very

937
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,159
very good for discovering this kind of

938
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,480
information clearly just sit out there

939
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,620
forever and it's peer-to-peer there's

940
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,760
not really anyone to take it down so

941
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,440
torrent sites if you're looking for this

942
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,600
data tend to be very powerful as well if

943
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,980
we do that for me

944
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,539
that's my password

945
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,100
yeah it's in there that came from the

946
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,940
LinkedIn breach wow oops well crap was

947
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,019
that my password for my bank account

948
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,120
absolutely that was my bank account

949
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,340
password it's relatively okay I got some

950
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,860
numbers got a symbol letters in there as

951
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,840
well it's 13 characters long I'll tell

952
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,340
you why that doesn't matter here in just

953
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,140
a little while remember that 13

954
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,600
characters long remember that part

955
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,179
all right well what else can we do

956
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:01,559
remember how I mentioned you can look at

957
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,059
government databases and government

958
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,260
records as well public record

959
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,399
essentially

960
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,500
absolutely you can and there are some

961
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,619
that are just absurdly easy and almost

962
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,179
ubiquitous so the United States

963
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,460
governments records generally speaking

964
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,500
the way that they do authentication is

965
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,639
they just

966
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,739
show you the information associated with

967
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,418
whatever you put in that's what they do

968
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:24,239
that's it and so we know where I've

969
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,040
lived now right Washington State Texas

970
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,080
or Alaska which one of those do I vote

971
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,760
out of I don't know we got three options

972
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,599
let's try all three

973
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,159
and if we do that it's asking me three

974
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,780
things what is your last name was your

975
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,980
first name I think we know that by now

976
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,980
what is a city that you vote out of well

977
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,440
that's something we found as well in the

978
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,000
case of Alaska it's very easy there's

979
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,399
only one city

980
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,219
oh man any lessons in the house

981
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,879
no good yes Dodge that bully

982
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,199
and then you look at this and it says

983
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,540
okay Matthew's Hussein Alaskan

984
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,099
Republican party oh shoot this is the

985
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,320
wrong audience for that isn't it oh man

986
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,480
don't worry it was a long time ago I

987
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,099
made mistakes I've learned I've

988
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:06,900
progressed in my life become a better

989
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,900
person with me and then it tells you the

990
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,200
ax exact addresses for both my parents

991
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,720
house and my own this is a little bit of

992
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,800
interesting slide for me to make because

993
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,780
I did blur out that information but at

994
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,260
the same time it's like why bother

995
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,420
please don't SWAT my family I'd really

996
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,460
rather you not do that but it is

997
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,320
actually this easy does it work for

998
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,099
celebrities yes it does absolutely

999
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:35,599
wow wow

1000
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,520
so now we update our map we've got

1001
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,859
location information we've got email

1002
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,099
addresses we've got passwords we've got

1003
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,060
it all

1004
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,339
nice there's a reason why this all

1005
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:48,359
matters

1006
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,339
yes we're gonna use our username and

1007
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,920
password to log in

1008
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,500
but what if that's not enough

1009
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,780
right what if that's not enough what if

1010
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,240
we need to bypass two-factation

1011
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,500
well if we know everything about our

1012
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,400
Target

1013
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,180
we can convince any support person at at

1014
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,240
T Verizon in serve bank here insert

1015
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,780
anything here that we are them

1016
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,700
absolutely we can do this and the most

1017
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,339
effective bypass for 2fa is to pretend

1018
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,859
like it's not there 2fa is hard 2fa is

1019
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,060
really hard look at a couple bypasses

1020
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,040
here in just a second but the easiest

1021
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,980
way to get around 2fa is to ignore it

1022
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,200
and now we have all the information we

1023
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,400
need to do that

1024
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
so step three let's get that cash all

1025
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,500
righty all right bang with USAA well we

1026
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,420
need to find that out potentially in my

1027
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,520
case it's extremely easy

1028
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,339
you go to any of those uh bio Pages you

1029
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:42,540
see that I graduated from the US Air

1030
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,000
Force Academy all right Google what bank

1031
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,619
does the U.S Air Force Academy stats use

1032
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,420
and you'll find that there's a loan they

1033
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,940
put out for the cadets and uh that means

1034
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,440
that almost everyone uses it another way

1035
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,300
you can do this military anyone here

1036
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,740
bank with USA

1037
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,380
yeah I spotted the feds got him got you

1038
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,480
and you and you and you yeah it's like

1039
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,079
90 of those folks USAA so very very easy

1040
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,760
to do it that way as well what if it's

1041
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,599
not

1042
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,160
here's a couple of things you can do

1043
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,720
first off there aren't a huge number of

1044
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,520
banks out there so try them all you can

1045
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,980
do that now there's a couple caveats to

1046
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,599
this what about credit unions credit

1047
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,880
unions are dime a dozen there are

1048
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,520
hundreds of them in any given state

1049
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,500
but Credit Unions tend to be only used

1050
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,980
by people who also at some point live

1051
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,040
very close locally these same ideas hold

1052
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,500
true where did they go to university

1053
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,619
where do they graduate high school maybe

1054
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,020
Google search that maybe look up credit

1055
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,119
unions in that search in that region

1056
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,339
and you're going to find basically all

1057
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,440
the banking opportunities that they were

1058
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,780
presented with in their formative years

1059
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,520
typically people get a bank and they

1060
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,619
stick with it does anyone here swaps

1061
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,140
more than five banks in their life

1062
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,260
got two people three people four nice

1063
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,579
you are Beyond average yes awesome

1064
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,680
so it's rare which means if we can

1065
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,660
Discover it awesome even if we don't

1066
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,040
know for sure we can create a short list

1067
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,300
and now we don't have to look up every

1068
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,980
Bank we only have to look up the few

1069
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,079
that are on that trip that short list

1070
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,660
uh now next thing about USAA remember I

1071
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,520
mentioned something about this whole

1072
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,520
13 character password business yeah uh

1073
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,020
oops

1074
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,720
so it turns out that USAA

1075
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,579
truncate your password so if you type in

1076
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:27,140
a 13 character password it will take it

1077
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,460
but it only checks the first 12.

1078
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,020
nice

1079
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,619
wow banking isn't that wonderful turns

1080
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,720
out uh unlike this individual I actually

1081
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,579
know the folks who do security some of

1082
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,079
the folks whose security at USA so I

1083
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,339
reached out to them I'm like hey bro

1084
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,920
what gives man like what is this what

1085
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,000
are you talk what and he said this this

1086
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,220
is a true story he said oh yeah I hear

1087
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,839
that all the time

1088
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,540
um here's the thing

1089
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,960
we used to get a lot of phone calls a

1090
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,640
lot of phone calls from people who

1091
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,020
forgotten their password and needed a

1092
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,820
password reset especially in January

1093
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,040
right after the New Year a little bit of

1094
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,900
drinking too much right there yeah a lot

1095
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,400
of phone calls and it took all of our HR

1096
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,920
time and was costing us money right I.T

1097
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,180
time sorry

1098
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,339
so we decided to truncate at 12 and it

1099
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,859
turns out that most people will forget

1100
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,680
their password after the 12th character

1101
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,260
yep you normally remember your first I

1102
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,060
don't know if it's first 12 particularly

1103
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,920
but for them when they truncated at 12

1104
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,260
most of the password resets were for

1105
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,760
people who tried to make a password that

1106
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,680
was longer than they had the ability to

1107
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,359
remember and therefore they became

1108
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:39,420
problem children let's fix that problem

1109
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,640
and uh I don't really like that fix but

1110
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,140
uh

1111
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,640
okay here we go

1112
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,859
alrighty now of course we have two

1113
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:51,540
Factor authentication here right so now

1114
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,560
we've got a username we got a password

1115
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,320
we try them and it works

1116
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,980
but it wants us to verify now if I'm on

1117
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,599
a trusted computer it might not do this

1118
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,500
step

1119
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,940
but of course we're attacking the

1120
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,680
schmuck International computer at least

1121
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,240
not yet

1122
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,520
so we have the step that comes up a

1123
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,619
little interesting fact here it's

1124
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,320
showing us the last four digits of the

1125
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,880
phone number here the phone numbers that

1126
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,579
are associated the account

1127
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:20,220
those are the only truly entropy related

1128
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,740
digits in a phone number for example we

1129
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,880
know that I've lived in at least Texas

1130
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,920
and Alaska and Air Force academies that

1131
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,839
must be Colorado as well that's three

1132
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:33,500
area codes and there's three area codes

1133
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,480
907-210 and 719

1134
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,760
so that means for these first three

1135
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,040
digit sets there are three options your

1136
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,320
entropy is literally three

1137
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,660
that's not very good so now the only

1138
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,339
thing that matters is these middle three

1139
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,420
digits

1140
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,760
that's it so what's the math on that

1141
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,160
well it is character set raised to the

1142
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,780
power of the length

1143
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,880
that'll be zero through nine so ten

1144
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,460
raised to the power of 3 and we have

1145
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,900
three options for the first three so

1146
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,520
times three so it is 10 raised to the

1147
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,380
third power times three it's technically

1148
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,000
less than that though because that

1149
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,380
assumes that you could have one

1150
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,599
character or two characters whereas you

1151
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,680
actually need to have three characters

1152
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,839
for this middle set every time so it's

1153
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,540
technically a little bit less than uh

1154
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,400
uh 10 raised to the third power times

1155
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,380
three but that's about your entry point

1156
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,720
for the phone numbers that's it now we

1157
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,680
don't really need that in order to go

1158
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,180
off the bank but I do find a little

1159
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,640
interesting that they're exposing some

1160
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,720
of my information that I'd rather they

1161
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,880
not do

1162
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,000
now it also gives us another option I

1163
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,040
need help logging on and this option is

1164
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,980
what we call Gold yep that is gold it is

1165
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,560
amazing I need help logging on help me

1166
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,339
get in please please you caller here

1167
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,859
help me hack the thing that I couldn't

1168
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:49,920
hack myself yes let's go and so we do

1169
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,380
that got a couple numbers here to call

1170
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,420
and I'm going to say

1171
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,480
I was at the beach in Dubai

1172
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,940
and as a result my phone has no network

1173
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,440
connectivity because I'm not in the

1174
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,960
region that I'm normally at

1175
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,760
and so I can't log in I can't get the

1176
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,619
SMS key in order to log in I need help

1177
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:12,300
accomplishing that now in banking the

1178
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,680
most common questions they're going to

1179
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,119
ask you are things like your security

1180
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,560
questions

1181
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,980
and your Social Security number we've

1182
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,000
just seen how to get all of that

1183
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,619
information right breach compilation

1184
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,920
data very heavily fraught with social

1185
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,740
security numbers for military so OPM

1186
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,720
breach and more military breaches oh

1187
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,880
gosh my social security number is in at

1188
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,579
least a dozen of these breach data lists

1189
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:37,440
and yours probably is too well maybe not

1190
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,660
a dozen I'm a high performer okay High

1191
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,579
performer but it'll be there it'll

1192
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:43,380
absolutely be there which means I have

1193
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,820
the answer to this I have the answer to

1194
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,660
this

1195
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,599
a lot of these systems also support

1196
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,640
um allowing your spouse access to these

1197
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,740
systems in which case it's expected that

1198
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,780
they may or may not know the social

1199
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,640
security number for the other person so

1200
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,720
if it's an account with more than one

1201
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,240
people one person and they say this one

1202
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,740
likely is because there's two separate

1203
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,680
phone numbers yeah you can sometimes get

1204
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,180
them to not even ask for the social

1205
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,740
security number but do alternative

1206
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,900
verification as well

1207
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,380
what about those uh

1208
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,140
what about those questions about your

1209
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,520
family and those kind of things right

1210
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,960
your security questions people forget

1211
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,160
their security questions all the time

1212
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,380
the reason why it always has you give

1213
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,180
multiple security questions and answers

1214
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,339
is because they know that people are

1215
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:27,359
going to forget certain security

1216
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,740
questions and they need to be able to

1217
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,359
ask you other ones so if it turns out

1218
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:31,680
that despite getting all of this

1219
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,760
information

1220
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,380
about me and potentially even my family

1221
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,880
you can't answer a certain security

1222
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,619
question all you do is give a fake

1223
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,020
answer and act confused about why it's

1224
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,819
not the real answer it's like I swear I

1225
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,920
put that in there it must be my mom was

1226
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,560
definitely born in Colorado Springs

1227
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,060
definitely hmm

1228
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,680
do we have another security question and

1229
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,119
they'll move on it will absolutely move

1230
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,220
on they are there to help you get in

1231
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,839
that's what they're there for and they

1232
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:55,859
will

1233
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,540
uh now there's another way we can bypass

1234
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,640
2fa in this case it turns out that if

1235
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,160
you use anyone who use Mac yeah guess

1236
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,180
what you can't hack Macs oh except um if

1237
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,680
we were to fish this user knowing

1238
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,760
everything we know about them like this

1239
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,960
is a Spearfish of the century at this

1240
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,220
point right we have multiple email

1241
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,780
addresses to use we know everything

1242
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,880
about them easiest Spearfish of my life

1243
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,420
and he's using Mac guess what iMessage

1244
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,940
integrates to OS X and it's very very

1245
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,980
common for people to have set that up

1246
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,380
this means if I fish your computer

1247
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,900
suddenly I have everything I needed from

1248
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,020
your phone anyways

1249
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,240
bypass for 2fa now it's a little bit

1250
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,740
beyond the scope of this talk we're not

1251
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,119
going to actually do fishing but we have

1252
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:37,680
everything we need to do the fishing and

1253
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,140
if we did that one click and boom we

1254
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,400
have access to iMessage no need for

1255
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,500
Google escalation because we're in the

1256
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,480
context of that user

1257
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,460
and so is this application so is this

1258
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,720
application

1259
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,400
very very easy what about more advanced

1260
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,319
two-factation bypass

1261
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,480
we can do that uh when we're doing the

1262
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,020
research for male sniper for the G suite

1263
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,460
for business stuff uh or Google

1264
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,319
workspace we were actually evaluating

1265
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:02,640
how Google does the actual

1266
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,900
Authentication

1267
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,940
and it turns out that in Google it'll

1268
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,200
respond with different ALR codes

1269
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,319
depending on uh

1270
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,000
the information that was input and the

1271
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,380
result that it's going to go to next for

1272
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,599
example if you're trying to use this to

1273
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,819
identify if the email is valid or not

1274
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,440
like we saw with mail sniper what male

1275
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,240
sniper is essentially doing is it's

1276
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,280
determining if it gets an ALR code of

1277
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,260
seven if it does it knows it's not a

1278
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,339
real email

1279
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:28,140
if it gets a different ALR code it knows

1280
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,720
it's a real email but we can do more and

1281
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,339
in doing this research and building in

1282
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,560
fact this Powershell component of uh

1283
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,960
mail sniper I was also doing a test at

1284
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,660
the time for a Fortune 50 company and so

1285
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,700
perfect opportunity to test it out but

1286
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,140
it was really confusing the results we

1287
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,260
got back because I kept getting one ALR

1288
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,060
codes for direct login

1289
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,119
this company was using Duo as its

1290
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,280
identity provider for two-factor

1291
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,900
authentication so what was supposed to

1292
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,579
happen is you type in your username your

1293
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:58,260
email address and then it gives you an

1294
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,140
ALR code of 13 here for a login redirect

1295
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,579
to redirect you to the Dual portal you

1296
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:04,140
type in your 2fa it goes back to Google

1297
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,520
you're typing your password and you're

1298
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,560
in that's not supposed to work but we

1299
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,540
found hundreds of users

1300
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,099
that were responding with an AR code of

1301
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:14,160
one what does that mean no 2fa the most

1302
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,240
common issue that we see in Enterprise

1303
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,900
2fa today isn't that it is bypassable

1304
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,119
it's that users haven't been opted into

1305
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,099
it the organization thinks that they are

1306
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,780
they even click the button that says

1307
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,579
globally enable this and it just didn't

1308
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:29,940
work and in fact in Microsoft that is an

1309
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,380
intended feature

1310
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,480
why because there is something else you

1311
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,940
can buy oh yeah pay for the better model

1312
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,339
absolutely that will enable that feature

1313
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:41,160
to be truly Mobile in default uh Outlook

1314
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,260
Exchange the way that it works is that

1315
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,960
it works on a user-by-user basis at the

1316
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,119
user agent level which means if you're

1317
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:49,740
logging with your browser versus your

1318
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,960
phone one gets 2fa the other does not if

1319
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,460
I'm an attacker that's easy to bypass

1320
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,040
right it's very very easy to bypass if

1321
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,560
you haven't tested your 2fa system

1322
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,060
inside of your organization you need to

1323
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,460
do this you absolutely need to do this

1324
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,619
because most organizations who use some

1325
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:07,380
form of 2fa think they have it and it

1326
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,599
turns out 20 of the users actually have

1327
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,520
it the other eighty percent there's

1328
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,579
workarounds absolar pen testing great

1329
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:17,839
way to find that absolutely

1330
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,180
and then finally we're now in and it is

1331
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,300
time to walk away with that cash I

1332
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,800
guarantee there's tons and tons of money

1333
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,079
behind this glossing blur for sure I'm

1334
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,760
definitely not broke don't call me on

1335
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,560
that

1336
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,640
all right that brings us to the end of

1337
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,319
our time we have four minutes left so I

1338
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,280
think I have time for a couple questions

1339
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,040
any questions

1340
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,839
just a comment

1341
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,160
your point is at some point some

1342
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,720
encounter or whatever

1343
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,880
said hey this is going to cost us more

1344
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,119
money to support people who don't know

1345
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,220
how to log in than it's going to be to

1346
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,000
lose money so yeah so the point was I'm

1347
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,700
repeating this for the virtual uh

1348
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,500
attendees so the point was that uh

1349
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,839
businesses are making decisions on our

1350
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,760
behalf where they're making a trade-off

1351
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,220
decision right we say our money versus

1352
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,079
the security that we provide our clients

1353
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,359
and which one do they go for it depends

1354
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,980
a little bit on the organization if that

1355
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,920
organization really wants to get in new

1356
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,660
clientele because they're saying hey

1357
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,520
we're the most secure versus if they

1358
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,660
already have a lot of clientele and it's

1359
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,920
not necessarily their Market strategy

1360
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,160
they may prioritize being less secure in

1361
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,140
order to make more bank and in the case

1362
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,540
of banks that tends to be the one it is

1363
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,660
in case of both specs not just USA I

1364
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,180
think there's a question in the back

1365
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,280
sorry

1366
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,359
I'm married I don't have kids

1367
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,640
I think the kids are the one that helped

1368
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,960
with that but the comment is if you're

1369
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,700
married you don't got lots of cash I am

1370
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,078
dual income no kids baby

1371
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,660
yes

1372
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,839
yep so the question is how do you use

1373
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,359
people uh pipl if you're not a business

1374
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:07,980
uh it used to be that you didn't have to

1375
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,300
be a business in order to do that same

1376
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,920
with Spokeo Spokeo you still I believe

1377
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,420
don't have to be a business the way you

1378
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,280
do this is you go to your state and you

1379
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,440
register an LLC for 500 bucks and then

1380
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,579
you're done yep

1381
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,260
systems now are based on that's a really

1382
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,760
really interesting question it's going

1383
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,020
so there's a question is about voice

1384
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,579
recognition this is taking us back to

1385
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:35,339
what 1984 with sneakers my voice is my

1386
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,520
password authenticate me yes what is my

1387
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,500
take on it though I find that to be very

1388
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,940
very interesting anyone here I have an

1389
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,680
Alexa I know for everyone who's

1390
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,760
virtually attending I just triggered

1391
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,520
their Alexa hey Alexa

1392
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,500
uh so have you ever experienced Alexa

1393
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,240
where you maybe have multiple people in

1394
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,800
your family in the family group and it

1395
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,079
can tell who is asking for a playlist of

1396
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:56,819
music based off of The Voice and they'll

1397
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:58,200
actually pick the playlist for that

1398
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,660
person very very kind of creepy but also

1399
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,880
interesting at the same time so based on

1400
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,460
ML and Ai and neural networks and more

1401
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,440
buzzwords this is starting to grow very

1402
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,700
heavily but what is the potential for uh

1403
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,400
false positive specifically is really

1404
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,140
really big question for example whenever

1405
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,819
a new biometric authentication voice for

1406
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,079
example is a biometric authentication

1407
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,300
mechanism that's what you are as opposed

1408
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,980
to what you have or what you know so

1409
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,359
whenever a new biometric authentication

1410
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,220
mechanism comes out people always want

1411
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,020
to test it every anyone's ever seen the

1412
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,319
twin test that works very very well for

1413
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,240
face ID yeah we got two twins they do

1414
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,640
this works like a champ same with thumb

1415
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,619
prints for them sometimes you can also

1416
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,540
get around it by simulating things I

1417
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,220
think specifically to voice it is

1418
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,480
unlikely that it's ever going to be

1419
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,540
secure because you can also use the same

1420
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,880
exact technology to create create

1421
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,619
somebody else's voice

1422
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:53,599
right but it's a great question

1423
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,140
it's like we're almost like classrooms

1424
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,579
um I don't know I've actually had rather

1425
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,440
decent luck with password spraying

1426
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,940
against G Suite

1427
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,839
um

1428
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,819
with Mill sniper modules now the mill

1429
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,260
sniper modules are really funky for G

1430
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,880
Suite that's my fault I wrote those my

1431
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,839
bad

1432
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,880
um so let me jump back to slide with

1433
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,839
most ever it's actually showing the G

1434
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:33,119
Suite here uh Google does something

1435
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,160
really really I guess it's not cool but

1436
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,040
it is powerful when you try to log in

1437
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,420
and so and this is part of the reason

1438
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,579
why we did the ALR research wow too many

1439
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:43,440
slides there we go and so if you notice

1440
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,819
here the string is actually really long

1441
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:46,260
so it's going through but it also is

1442
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,760
using proxy hosts so it's rotating

1443
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,380
through a bunch of different hosts the

1444
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,700
reason it does that is because if you

1445
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,760
try a bad username on Google more than

1446
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,619
three times in a row sometimes five it

1447
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:57,119
depends a little bit but more than three

1448
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,260
to five times in a row it gives you a

1449
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,300
caption and now male sniper is like oh

1450
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,800
what do I do with this but the thing is

1451
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,540
Google does those captchas based off of

1452
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,940
source IP address which means if you

1453
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,619
rotate it through a bunch of proxy hosts

1454
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:10,140
that you can spin up in AWS it will work

1455
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,940
like a champ I imagine that's probably

1456
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,440
your uh your difficulty right

1457
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,180
yeah Google password sprays are actually

1458
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,380
really fast because their site is

1459
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,180
efficient isn't that funky it's like the

1460
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,859
site is so efficient it's easier to hack

1461
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:27,119
because we can guess passwords even

1462
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,220
faster uh but you do have to with Google

1463
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,200
either use something like these proxy

1464
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,640
hosts or you can actually just funnel it

1465
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,900
straight through a tool called proxy

1466
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,400
Canon I highly recommend taking a look

1467
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,680
at that one that one's super useful I

1468
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,319
use that for male sniper even when I'm

1469
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,780
going after owa actually

1470
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,819
it's a couple of questions from Discord

1471
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:48,300
uh someone said or Sergeant Dean said

1472
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,339
how do you have any defenses for this

1473
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:51,900
kind of stuff how would you reduce your

1474
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,400
attack surface

1475
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,920
okay great question First Defense make

1476
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,570
sure your kids names are basic

1477
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,140
[Laughter]

1478
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,720
[Applause]

1479
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,000
right so defense is against this uh this

1480
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,980
won't quite work against me because I've

1481
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,599
checked all of this against myself right

1482
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:09,000
so is my password still the one that's

1483
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,119
on the screen no no because I've looked

1484
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:13,920
regularly so if you do these techniques

1485
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,540
against yourself 100 legal to do that

1486
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,000
right 100 and if you if you're concerned

1487
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,559
about this and you do this to yourself

1488
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:21,599
you will know exactly what the art of

1489
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,280
the possible is for the attacker and

1490
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,440
then you can adjust against that now

1491
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,420
again with this the most difficult

1492
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,420
hurdle to overcome was MFA absolutely

1493
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,220
was it's the number one defense beyond

1494
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,260
that multi-factation multi-fact

1495
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,119
indication let me say it a dozen times

1496
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:39,420
MFA unfortunately in the banking sector

1497
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,920
specifically in fact I was at a fintech

1498
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,960
conference last week oh my gosh these

1499
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,880
guys are literally just going 20 years

1500
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,059
back in the past re rediscovering all of

1501
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,559
the issues that we've been trying to

1502
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,720
patch and so that whole support chain to

1503
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,819
get around it works exceedingly well

1504
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,020
also works pretty well in the

1505
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,700
hospitality industry and unfortunately

1506
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,440
as a result it makes your Banks much

1507
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,000
easier to hack than your Facebook

1508
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,859
account isn't that crazy your bank's

1509
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:02,819
easier to hack than your Facebook

1510
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:05,058
account

1511
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,319
all right well I think we're out of time

1512
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:09,599
but thanks everyone thanks Matt awesome

1513
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,619
it was great having you all
