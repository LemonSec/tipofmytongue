1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,490
okay the law title or the presentation

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,690
title you can read it I'm not going to

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,800
it took me way too long to type the one

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,559
thing that I've learned over the past

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,220
two days and it's I wish there were more

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:20,070
people here for this but the one thing I

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,369
have learned is that there is no more

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,260
wretched hive of scum and villainy than

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,990
this place that I've seen thus far I

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,420
have seen misrepresentation copyright

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,719
infringement a reverse reverse

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,800
engineering violations and there's

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,710
certain amount of stalking going on as

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,180
an attorney this concerns me but I'm

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,100
also an information security

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,960
professional in all seriousness that's

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,850
where I started I started more on the

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,530
information security / IT side now I've

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,610
also might run my own business I've run

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,420
a bookstore I've run a consulting

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,859
company I've been both with business

22
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,920
information security and I'm also a

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,780
licensed attorney so I'm somewhat all

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,040
over the place plus I'm a notary public

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,790
in case anyone needs something done

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,119
right now I'd like to give you a quote

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,680
from John Adams from the musical 1776

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,020
because it kind of sums up how most

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,420
people feel about attorneys it's I've

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,810
come to the conclusion that one useless

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,600
man is a disgrace to useless men are a

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,880
law firm and three useless men our

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,380
Congress so there you go now we all have

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,079
see I'm not sure if all of you have

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,729
heard this but I've heard the phrase no

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,508
one loves an attorney until they need

37
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,130
one the same can be said ironically the

38
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,530
same can be said about business

39
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,658
executives as well as information

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,990
security professionals and why is this

41
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,420
well we tend to be over educated no one

42
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,460
loves that everyone thinks were way

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,409
smarter than we need to be we tend to be

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,929
overpaid once again no one likes that

45
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,270
they want to be overpaid and then three

46
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,820
we have to make difficult decisions that

47
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,820
no one else likes and what's especially

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,710
interesting is the juncture of business

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,780
information security and law represents

50
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,090
some really difficult decisions that

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,770
involve all three aspects and yet

52
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,870
business people Hey

53
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,100
dealing with lawyers business people

54
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,510
don't want to pay for information

55
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,859
security programs business or

56
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,920
information security people don't really

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,690
want to study the law and frankly they

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,820
do either be doing the technical work

59
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,920
than the business side at least on

60
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,060
average and then you should cut the lead

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,549
I had lawyers who want to avoid

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,620
everybody so it's like there's very

63
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,100
little communication and why is this

64
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,660
relevant oh forgot I have to say this I

65
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,960
thought all the legal disclaimers for

66
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,760
all the presentations very cute I'm an

67
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,150
attorney I put much more serious one

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,010
over a basic basic message same as

69
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,160
everyone else which is what I'm saying

70
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:59,070
is my advice or my advice or my opinion

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,079
it doesn't represent legal advice if you

72
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,329
have a legal issue please consult an

73
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,280
attorney this is not the appropriate

74
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,140
venue for consulting this particular

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,320
attorney it does not represent a client

76
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,649
contract blah blah blah anyways in all

77
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,450
seriousness this is how I picture the

78
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,760
juncture of business information

79
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,890
security in law and you'll notice that

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,079
there are multiple levels all going

81
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,958
different directions you've got people

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,080
in cars or groups in cars going all

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,810
sorts of places and it's a lot like what

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,880
happens in business and information

85
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,260
security in law because what happens is

86
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,359
everyone's in their car they're going

87
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,579
different places and they never see each

88
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,310
other or talk to each other unless

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,930
they're in a car accident or they hop

90
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,370
out of their car because there's an

91
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,540
earthquake or something like that and

92
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,040
they're all having to talk to one

93
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:52,230
another so there's very little

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,329
communication that goes on so what I'm

95
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,549
going to talk about the rules of the

96
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:01,200
road basically the laws and I'm going to

97
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:03,420
go into a nauseating detail ok maybe not

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,950
maybe not this morning for the number of

99
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,790
people are here and for those who are

100
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:11,519
not / how many people never mind I want

101
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,230
to ask there's four in law what I'm

102
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,480
going to do is federal law state law and

103
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,760
foreign law and then I'm also going to

104
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,589
help you understand the dangers or the

105
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,750
risks of the road and I'm going to take

106
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,210
it from a customer perspective and an

107
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,190
employee perspective and then finally

108
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,239
looking ahead how can you take charge of

109
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,770
your driving be

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,139
a little bit more of an offensive driver

111
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,120
so that you can avoid the issues that

112
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,020
people run into and maybe some ethical

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,669
considerations before we get into the

114
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,530
laws I want to show you an infographic

115
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:42,479
you've probably seen or if you haven't

116
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,568
seen it's kind of entertaining for me at

117
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,610
least which was these are the breaches

118
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:51,060
data breaches that have occurred over

119
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,250
the past was 2005 through 2018

120
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,180
and you'll notice in 2018 that the

121
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,849
number of data breaches as recorded by

122
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,000
this group went down they went down

123
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:05,759
believe it was 12 44 and yet the number

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,099
of actual records the number of customer

125
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,139
or consumer records went up and it was

126
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:15,990
446 million records so it appears that

127
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,729
people when they're when the bad actors

128
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,650
are performing data breaches and

129
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:21,389
gathering information they appear to be

130
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,849
getting more information or better

131
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,380
information than they used to if you

132
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:27,509
take a look at the beginning it was you

133
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,949
know very light and it's got that upward

134
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:37,380
and nasty upward trend the FBI reported

135
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:43,229
in 2018 1.2 billion dollars lost just

136
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:50,539
from email just from email oriented bad

137
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:53,940
acting so this is my take on the law

138
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:55,139
they love their acronyms well pardon me

139
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,780
for a second I'm actually going to take

140
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,539
this off you don't have to actually have

141
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,539
a code on to perform or to practice law

142
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:08,400
but sometimes it helps

143
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:10,409
so these acronyms are laws at the

144
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,388
federal level and I'm not sure how many

145
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:14,789
of them you all know but I'm gonna go

146
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:16,680
through and give you my interpretation

147
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:19,830
of the laws name and then I'll use the

148
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,830
actual laws name as I walk through so

149
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:27,180
we've got CFA C flipping alligators

150
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:29,460
we've got nippy a' hippy a' GLBA this is

151
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,009
especially appropriate geeks love beer

152
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,900
authentically there's the Homeland

153
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:38,550
Security Act which we've all heard of

154
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,299
Patriot Act did you say FISA there's Sox

155
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,150
every

156
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:46,250
needs a new pair of socks there's PCI or

157
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:51,388
payment payment s Quietus interruptus

158
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:53,819
there's F de Coppa for Kappa Joe can

159
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:57,509
spam which we've all heard of obviously

160
00:06:53,819 --> 00:07:01,949
with the can of spam Factor DMCA which

161
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:04,500
we all love and TCP a for TCP is awesome

162
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:07,740
and then there's some industry specific

163
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,440
laws FISMA FedRAMP FedRAMP is where all

164
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,419
the cool kids skateboard now it is

165
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,520
there's Newark which was mentioned in a

166
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:18,299
presentation yesterday and that stands

167
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,870
for not exactly rocket science I'm not

168
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,419
too good with following the letters and

169
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,039
actually the Newark regulations kind of

170
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:29,310
our rocket science in some way so it's

171
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,080
especially funny there's high tech law

172
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:36,629
which is in healthcare industry and then

173
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:40,050
see fats now I'm actually going to use

174
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:41,699
the real titles but in reality I'm not

175
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,169
going through all of these laws I'm

176
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,000
putting them up here so that you can

177
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,250
look at them and afterwards if you're

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,659
really interested and you download you

179
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,150
go and take a look on the website or

180
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:53,610
wherever they decide to post these you

181
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,690
can take a look at the laws and research

182
00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:00,449
them ad nauseam the ones that I think

183
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,400
you need to be especially aware of as an

184
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,620
information security professional and a

185
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,299
business leader would be the Computer

186
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,469
Fraud and Abuse Act that's the one that

187
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,659
basically is the basis of most of why we

188
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:15,449
do what we do it's the accessing

189
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:17,610
computers with unauthorized access of

190
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:21,330
computers that's the one that was passed

191
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,190
originally that says unless you've got a

192
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,659
reason to be accessing this government

193
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,430
computer you shouldn't be on it and

194
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:29,430
nowadays you've got a disclaimer that's

195
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,199
much longer than the one I had that's

196
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:35,510
whenever you go on to a government

197
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,760
computer closely affiliated with that is

198
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,578
the national information infrastructure

199
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,229
Protection Act and that one is the one

200
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:47,069
that expanded that's the law that

201
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:49,770
expanded the CFA on to non government

202
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,840
computers plus it also said not only can

203
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:55,050
you not access it if you're not author

204
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,630
now if you damage it there's an issue so

205
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:01,880
malware spyware that sort of thing

206
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,880
that's where that started taking effect

207
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:07,440
HIPAA is one that we've all heard of but

208
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,000
the only net effect that I've seen of

209
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,600
hip I mean other than the data breach

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,850
notifications that we have to deal with

211
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,110
but in all seriousness the only

212
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,760
notification EDD effect of that is when

213
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,529
I go to the doctor now I have to fill

214
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,689
out like three forms and sign them

215
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,310
saying that they can distribute my

216
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,230
information to whoever they need to

217
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,699
distribute the information to they're

218
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,430
not going to specify who they're gonna

219
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,770
send that information to but they're

220
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,140
allowed to do it which actually makes me

221
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,910
feel kind of like the law is almost

222
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,230
doing the reverse of what it intends to

223
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,939
do which is protect your information

224
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,560
because now you don't even know where

225
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,300
the information is going and you're

226
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,579
signing off on it so that's pretty

227
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,779
awesome DMCA I'm sure everyone who's

228
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,820
been in the business for any length of

229
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,000
time knows what DMCA is basically it's

230
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:57,150
the whole we're going to try to lock

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,820
down what people do with digital digital

232
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,930
recordings digital software pretty much

233
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,530
everything digital rights management

234
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:07,380
there's much more to it but that was one

235
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:10,140
of the things that frankly over the

236
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,600
course the last two days this is one of

237
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,920
the laws that probably was broken once

238
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,410
or twice or at least my lief stepped on

239
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,829
so now there's the Children's Online

240
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,270
Privacy Protection Act and this is one

241
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,710
that I don't know how many of you

242
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,089
actually know about you may have heard

243
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,480
of it but you probably don't know what

244
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:32,550
it actually does it protects children 13

245
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,530
years or younger and that's all it

246
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,229
really protects that and some people

247
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,970
with disabilities and it what it

248
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,490
requires is that in certain situations

249
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,910
for example you know when children are

250
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,890
getting going on to a site that is

251
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,959
either charging them money or has an

252
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,029
inappropriate material that they're you

253
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,540
have to get parental consent so Net

254
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:59,720
Nanny safe site and those types of sites

255
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,719
now exist strictly because of that law

256
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,810
a final law or a final law in this

257
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,040
particular slide is the

258
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,079
gramm-leach-bliley act or geeks love

259
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,589
beer authentically as I like to remember

260
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,599
it as the that was an act that was

261
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,190
passed strictly for financial

262
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,899
institutions because they were having a

263
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,930
problem where financial institutions

264
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:23,110
were releasing information or were

265
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,829
having breeches and not much was being

266
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,680
done about it

267
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:28,779
this basically mandates that financial

268
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,029
institutions have to have some sort of

269
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:32,769
program to fight to protect their

270
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:35,800
financial data and their consumer data

271
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,690
and in my mind this was one of the first

272
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:44,560
ones that took a pretty serious approach

273
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:46,630
to it the u.s. Patriot Act and go on the

274
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,699
Homeland Security Act I think my icons

275
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,370
moved a little bit because the Sox are

276
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,570
now next to the Homeland Security Act ok

277
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,420
I like it

278
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,000
ok sarbanes-oxley how many of you have

279
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,729
heard of sarbanes-oxley okay I won't go

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,440
into much detail basically it says all

281
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,630
you executives you've done some bad

282
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,240
things and okay so now we're gonna have

283
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:11,769
you sign off on your financials and the

284
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,839
reality is I now listen to Cle or

285
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:16,690
continuing legal education classes on

286
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:21,130
how can executives sign off on things

287
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:23,709
and still maintain a lack of knowledge

288
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:27,070
about what they signed off on it's like

289
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,800
I mean not yeah exactly that it's not

290
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,720
that it's stated that way of course

291
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,189
there's also the can-spam act and I'm

292
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,949
not sure if any of you have heard of it

293
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,170
or a couple people have heard of it but

294
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:39,939
the funny thing is is the act intended

295
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,510
on making our lives better by getting

296
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,630
rid of spam I still have more spam than

297
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:49,420
ever in my box and the irony of the act

298
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:52,779
is that a lot of states were actually

299
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:55,209
passing spam laws at the time and so

300
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:58,630
they were looking to prevent spam this

301
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:00,969
act superseded their efforts and now

302
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:04,360
it's being called the you can still spam

303
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:07,500
Act because it effectively doesn't

304
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,500
prevent spam at all

305
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,540
pardon me I'm gonna go back and then

306
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:16,300
finally the one I wanted to point out

307
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,209
isn't a law at all and yet it's one of

308
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,310
the most important ones for retail and

309
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:24,099
even for business big business like

310
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,739
Cisco I work for Cisco as a engineer and

311
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,399
so anybody who takes credit card

312
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,000
transactions PC I have we all heard of

313
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,850
PCI

314
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,709
yeah PCI DSS is one of these standards

315
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,660
that were we're expected to follow and

316
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,699
it basically is what how do you protect

317
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,610
credit card information in credit card

318
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:45,130
the consumer information the reality is

319
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,860
it's not a law at all it's covered under

320
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,800
contract law so when you sign up with a

321
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,509
credit card processing vendor they say

322
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
here's what you have to do to protect

323
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:57,069
the information here's the standard

324
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,160
we've designed that you must follow the

325
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:01,660
reality is is if you don't do it there's

326
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,089
not a cop that's gonna show up at your

327
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,189
door what is gonna happen is they're

328
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,420
gonna raise the percentage that they

329
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,250
charge you for your credit card

330
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,779
transactions or they're gonna prosecute

331
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,880
you under contract law they're gonna

332
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,740
take you to civil court and sue the

333
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,259
bejesus out of you and get lots of money

334
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,779
if you have any money although they're

335
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:21,160
the ones giving you credit so you would

336
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,790
think that suing them the other way

337
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,980
would actually much more effective that

338
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,810
reminds me I think that's maybe

339
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:34,930
something on Monday morning I need to

340
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:37,630
look up so now those were all just

341
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:41,199
general broadly applicable federal laws

342
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:45,509
I mentioned Newark before Newark is the

343
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:48,189
national or North American reliability

344
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,439
corporation and so you say to yourself

345
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:52,360
its corporation it's not a law you're

346
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:55,810
absolutely right there was a law passed

347
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,360
that basically established Newark and

348
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,589
Newark came out of a prior group called

349
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,560
Newark

350
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:07,689
yes Newark came from Newark and they

351
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,239
Newark when they became Newark from

352
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:13,050
Newark

353
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,439
they found out that they also as part of

354
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:19,319
the provisions of the Act had to become

355
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:22,230
what was known as an NRO or a national

356
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:25,170
regulatory organization as part of that

357
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,329
they said well wait a minute are we that

358
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,949
organization the Act didn't say that so

359
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,459
they actually had to apply to become an

360
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:32,008
NRO

361
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:34,469
but they were made the NRL and what that

362
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:37,679
does for you is their regulations and

363
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,629
standards the ones that they set are now

364
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,540
the ones that they can regulate they can

365
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:45,569
actually they unlike many agencies or

366
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,118
unlike many groups like PCI DSS where

367
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:50,360
it's not a law at all they can actually

368
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:55,050
take their regulations and go to the

369
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,819
specific violator and prosecute or at

370
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,790
least they can bring them up with

371
00:15:56,819 --> 00:16:01,199
charges now HIPAA I'm not going to go

372
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,709
into we all know about that gramm leach

373
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,410
Lee that's fine payment card I think the

374
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:10,529
only other interesting one out of this

375
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:13,618
from my perspective is the chemical

376
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:17,100
facilities and anti-terrorism Standards

377
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:20,369
Act and how many of you have heard of

378
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,079
that one okay so there's one person here

379
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:24,959
in the room who had heard this one and

380
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,229
so this is interesting to me because

381
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,329
it's an industry-specific act but it

382
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,740
actually affects way more than what

383
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:33,929
they're talking about you would think

384
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,170
that by the title it would apply to

385
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:38,639
chemical facilities but oh no no

386
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,189
chemical facilities are broadly defined

387
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,199
basically anybody who has a certain

388
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:46,049
number of a prohibited chemical over a

389
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,459
certain quantity is become subject to

390
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:51,929
the act that means academic institutions

391
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:54,388
corporations individuals and their

392
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,740
households joking about that because

393
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,509
hopefully you don't have that much of

394
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,209
any of these chemicals but it represents

395
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:05,370
or it represents the idea that sometimes

396
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:08,458
when we're in business and we're doing

397
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:10,349
information security there are federal

398
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,539
laws that are broadly applicable and

399
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:14,579
there are industry specific ones that

400
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:17,158
you also have to worry about in general

401
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,109
if there's industry specific for all of

402
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:20,760
you who aren't big into the law you've

403
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,020
got the Constitution that's like the

404
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,569
mack daddy of all

405
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,000
law in the United States we all learned

406
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:30,480
this in our you know government class

407
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,730
you've got federal you've got draw

408
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,580
little dots to a circle underneath

409
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,100
saying industry-specific then you draw a

410
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,750
super long line that goes roughly down

411
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,060
to the floor and a little bubble called

412
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,730
state law and then you've got this

413
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,700
nebulous cloud over here called foreign

414
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:50,040
law and sometimes it kind of meshes over

415
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,630
federal and so that's how I'm kind of

416
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:56,280
looking at it so why do you care

417
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,800
okay federal law it's way far away

418
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:02,399
people in you know people pass in laws

419
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,440
and in Congress and in DC and that's

420
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,630
what they do and frankly why do we care

421
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,910
well if you take a look businesses are

422
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,250
getting increasingly there's increasing

423
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,890
amount of enforcement for all of the

424
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,170
laws that have been passed i think

425
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,300
there's increased sophistication for

426
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,150
understanding how to apply the law to

427
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,700
technology even if a understanding of

428
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,680
the technology is not necessarily there

429
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,750
and these are some of the cases that

430
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,480
have come up recently when i say

431
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,670
recently in the last year anthem had to

432
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,160
pay the office of civil rights 16

433
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,920
million dollars for a HIPAA breach

434
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,670
you've got the sec in january announcing

435
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,550
that they are prosecuting i think it was

436
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,830
five or nine hackers who were grabbing

437
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:50,639
edgar documents and messing with edgar

438
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:53,370
documents for the sec the can-spam act

439
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,680
believe it or not actually got somebody

440
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,419
to pay some money there's a company

441
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,390
paying almost a million dollars because

442
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:03,240
of unsolicited marketing and then

443
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,580
finally a teacher was sentenced to three

444
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,610
years that's criminal law was sentenced

445
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,409
for a hacking case so things are

446
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,179
happening and people are being

447
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,190
prosecuted and this was just me going

448
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,170
out and taking a look like literally

449
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,880
saying what kind of prosecutions have

450
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,500
occurred within the past couple you know

451
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,870
past couple of months in putting a

452
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,740
timeframe on it there's a lot that goes

453
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:28,620
out or a lot of cases that are being

454
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:31,320
prosecuted and you could put page after

455
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,360
page after page this is for me

456
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,220
the reason you should care is it's out

457
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,820
there and it's happening all the time

458
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,250
can

459
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,590
continually even your business may be

460
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:47,430
involved in legal cases that you're not

461
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:49,740
aware of so I think state law even

462
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,170
though it's in a bubble way down by the

463
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,120
ground there and it's very small I think

464
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,990
it's actually more important because I

465
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,510
think it's more relevant to us and out

466
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,520
of all the states

467
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,830
there's something about California that

468
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,570
we all have to love I came from

469
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,000
Wisconsin originally and dangit

470
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,970
California wants this Taylor steel are

471
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,870
freaking cheese okay they've got all the

472
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,550
agriculture

473
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,709
they've got Arnold Schwarzenegger and

474
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,690
now they want our cheese I'm not good

475
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,640
with that the one thing they do do

476
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,300
pretty well though is pass cybersecurity

477
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:28,920
or technology-oriented laws they do have

478
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:32,550
some a lot of very focused individuals

479
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,440
who understand technology and so one of

480
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,540
the laws that they passed is one of the

481
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,000
first data breach one of the first well

482
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:43,649
written effective identity theft data

483
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,680
breach laws in 2002 its Senate bill 13

484
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:50,340
86 and for anybody who deals with

485
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,490
residents of California or has a

486
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:56,580
business in California or does commerce

487
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:59,730
with California or citzen thinks about

488
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:03,540
California or potentially might have

489
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,300
live in the same state or country as

490
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,250
California basically anyone anything to

491
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,960
do with California if you're doing

492
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,480
business there in all seriousness it

493
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,350
means that you are subject to this law

494
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,860
so if you have a data breach in North

495
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:21,629
Carolina you know and it involves any

496
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,360
residents of California you have to

497
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:27,330
notify them and in addition to having to

498
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,550
notify their their probably their

499
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,379
attorney in general you also have to

500
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,360
contact ultimately contact those

501
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,770
consumers who have been affected what's

502
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,449
interesting about it and the reason I

503
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,450
mention it California has a really good

504
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,790
one but all 50 states every single state

505
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,340
has a data breach notification law of

506
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,230
some variety so you do need to be aware

507
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,439
that not only at the federal level under

508
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:52,320
consumer fraud abuse

509
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,120
communication Privacy Act there's a

510
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,370
number of laws that have provisions

511
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,469
related to data breach each of the

512
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,029
states also has one and it may have

513
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,539
different requirements that you have to

514
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:06,450
take a look at California also

515
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:08,549
interestingly there's the word

516
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,409
encryption has been mentioned once or

517
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:12,600
twice over the course of the past couple

518
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:16,049
of days and encryption is becoming

519
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,360
increasingly important in California

520
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:20,070
defined it so they they went into one of

521
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,139
their laws and right up front in their

522
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,330
definitions they defined what encryption

523
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:26,699
was now personally whether or not you

524
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,980
agree with their their definition of

525
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:32,460
encryption is not as important as the

526
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,850
fact that the fact that encryption was

527
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,549
defined is important because it means

528
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:42,658
that legislators are starting to be

529
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:45,029
aware of technology and put words into

530
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:47,070
the law specifically related to it so

531
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:50,070
that's going to constrain our behavior

532
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,860
as information security professionals so

533
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:55,620
what they consider encryption can affect

534
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:59,309
for example rot13 you know is that

535
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,559
encryption you know it's technically

536
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:03,870
under the definition of encryption by

537
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,970
California Standards yeah it is now is

538
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:11,360
it effective encryption that's a totally

539
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:14,070
different argument double rot13 someone

540
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,320
now in terms of other laws state laws

541
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,820
that are I haven't gone into the North

542
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,009
Carolina ones but the other state laws

543
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,870
that are non North Carolina how many

544
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:25,799
people are not from North Carolina here

545
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:34,289
okay so just a shout out where you're

546
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:36,480
from Wisconsin alright so Minnesota

547
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:39,750
alright so you know my pain about them

548
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:46,169
stealing our cheese right all right by

549
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:47,879
the way effing Bucky so anyways the I'll

550
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,129
mention Minnesota since someone talked

551
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:54,209
about it they were one of the first

552
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:56,250
states to adopt the pci-dss standard at

553
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,779
least partially in law so what they did

554
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,110
was they actually took the wording from

555
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:02,010
the pci-dss standard and put it into law

556
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,510
and

557
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,980
so you're starting to see that more and

558
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,450
more where the law is looking at the

559
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,000
people who actually understand the

560
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,190
technology and using their words and

561
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,270
what's interesting about that is not

562
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:17,310
only Minnesota did a partial adoption

563
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:20,220
Nevada did a wholesale adoption by

564
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:22,679
referencing the PCI DSS standard so if

565
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,410
you look in the Nevada law related to

566
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,470
credit card processing it says we as a

567
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:32,310
state or as a legislature have decided

568
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:35,370
to adopt this standard whatever latest

569
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:38,580
version they have on file is what is law

570
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:40,739
in our state and that's kind of scary in

571
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,620
a way because it's basically abdicating

572
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,200
the responsibility for what the law is

573
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,020
to people who know the technology which

574
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,970
is kind of cool in the sense that it's

575
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,650
put in responsibility where those people

576
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,230
have the knowledge but on the other hand

577
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,030
those people don't know the law and so

578
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,650
when they write something poorly or when

579
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,560
they define a standard and that standard

580
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:04,170
doesn't go through sufficient review

581
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,030
that should scare you a little bit let's

582
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,660
see what out of the rest of this the

583
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:11,940
Vermont with the data brokers places

584
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,650
that collect information they passed law

585
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,910
where you have the ability to opt out I

586
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:19,170
don't want to be part of your data

587
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:21,180
collection and you'll see this in you

588
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:28,590
know another slide not specifically

589
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:30,260
related to Vermont now what I find let's

590
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:33,840
see here

591
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:36,990
California okay so as I said before

592
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,850
you've got writ large you've got

593
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:45,180
computer crime and this book when I went

594
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:47,219
to law school was the extent of computer

595
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,550
crime and I went to law school in 2010

596
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,650
so it's not like it was that long ago

597
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,600
but when I went I was super excited for

598
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,640
the class I go into class I did it as a

599
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,139
second career and so I'm pretty

600
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,610
passionate when I get involved in things

601
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,980
and I've been a computer person for a

602
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:04,979
really long time I signed up for the

603
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,990
class and normally when you go to a law

604
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,520
class you get four books like you have

605
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,130
to buy four books you spend some

606
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,770
ridiculous sum of money this had one

607
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,779
book I buy the book and it's this thick

608
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,059
normally the books are like twice

609
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:21,679
thick and you've got four of them I'm

610
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:25,109
like really so I literally read the book

611
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,859
but scanned through it overnight walked

612
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:32,279
in the next day and said WTF this is all

613
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:34,649
wiretapping and telegraph law I mean

614
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,830
literally to telephone wiretapping and

615
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:40,678
telegraph law and my instructor at the

616
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:43,649
time the professor he goes yep that's

617
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,139
what most law is based off of you've got

618
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:48,718
to be kidding me

619
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:50,758
so if you're wondering whether or not

620
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:52,979
legislators and lawyers are a little

621
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,070
slow in adopting technology that might

622
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:58,469
answer a question but writ large you've

623
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,029
got computer crime and computer crime

624
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:03,719
covers things like unauthorized access

625
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:05,729
damage to computers mice's a lot of

626
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:07,619
things and I'm gonna kind of walk

627
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:09,989
through the state of the law in the

628
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:11,459
United States computer trespass covered

629
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:14,489
by all 50 states data exfiltration

630
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,899
covered by all 50 states so data breach

631
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:19,499
you've got it

632
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:22,199
hacking tools in Europe there are some

633
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:23,460
places were just owning hacking software

634
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,830
is against the law

635
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,739
I believe Germany or Austria is one of

636
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,689
those places ransomware in computer

637
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:32,519
extortion there are five states

638
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,499
currently that have laws specifically

639
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,669
about that or there may be more but

640
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:38,609
those are the ones that I know about

641
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:40,739
currently now for malware and for

642
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:43,499
spyware and viruses about one-fifth of

643
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:45,629
the states have laws denial of service

644
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:47,909
there are actually laws about denial of

645
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:51,238
service for more than half of the states

646
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:54,089
there's fishing laws half the states now

647
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:55,950
these are all state oriented laws kernel

648
00:27:54,089 --> 00:28:00,269
fuzzing which I thought was especially

649
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:02,249
appropriate now that is without ferry

650
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:04,229
user exception so in other words if

651
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:06,109
you're doing kernel fuzzing and you are

652
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:08,309
not doing it for the purposes of

653
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:10,649
interoperability to trying to make this

654
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:12,509
work with this and you don't if you

655
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,959
don't have a legal right to be doing

656
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:17,759
that reverse engineering about all 50

657
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,549
states under contract law that's against

658
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:24,950
the law so if the person who did the

659
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:26,680
kernel fuzzing presentation here yeah

660
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,290
block

661
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,540
exactly blockchain and cryptocurrency

662
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:34,030
was to me it was a really fascinating

663
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,560
and heard my head the the presentation I

664
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:38,860
was like oh my god this is the

665
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:41,710
complexity of it is amazing about one

666
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,949
fifth of the states have passed laws the

667
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,210
interesting part is on one end of the

668
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,360
spectrum you've got the states who are

669
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,830
like yeah cryptocurrency woohoo and then

670
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,330
you've got the other half or the other

671
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,540
end of the spectrum which is like oh

672
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:58,419
hell no no we're not now you can't do

673
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,360
that and so the laws there are all over

674
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,970
the place I from a personal perspective

675
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,850
I think blockchain is going to be a

676
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,590
technology that we use both in business

677
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,090
but I also think it will apply to the

678
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,300
law eventually because it's one of these

679
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:15,790
ways where you can have things be

680
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:18,070
authenticated and verified by a wide

681
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:21,520
body of people or what are laws right

682
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,620
laws are the basically rules that we

683
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,540
have that have been authenticated by a

684
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,820
group of people the way we authenticate

685
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:31,090
them is by electing people or by people

686
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:35,290
remaining in office even though Whedon

687
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:38,949
didn't necessarily elect them so that's

688
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:40,899
the state of state laws North Carolina

689
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,550
so a lot of people who are here from

690
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,830
North Carolina we do have data breach

691
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:48,520
notification law if you're concerned to

692
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:52,629
north carolina general statutes 75-65 no

693
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:56,290
set computer crime laws writ large cyber

694
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:59,170
stalking the very first presentation or

695
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:02,820
the second president actually the second

696
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:08,470
presentation was a discussion of a

697
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:12,010
private investigator contacting friends

698
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:14,890
of the person they're actually

699
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:18,190
investigating technically under cyber

700
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:21,160
stalking that would qualify and if you

701
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,930
didn't have a legal reason to be doing

702
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,820
that you could be prosecuted even as a

703
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:27,220
private investigator because private

704
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:30,639
investigators have pretty narrow lines

705
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,590
to follow sometimes there's my favorite

706
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,810
under North Carolina other than

707
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,790
alienation of affection which I have

708
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,520
actually written up a complaint for

709
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,820
which is pretty awesome

710
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,400
that's a legal thing the disclosure of

711
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,429
private images or revenge porn

712
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,430
so anyone been prosecuted for revenge

713
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:53,430
porn in this room anyone want to admit

714
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:56,670
that they've been this is where you

715
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:59,730
basically post a picture of someone's

716
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,550
private parts or of them with their

717
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,700
private parts exposed without

718
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:09,750
authorization or without consents

719
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:12,300
without it's unauthorized it has to be

720
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,650
out to public you know to public review

721
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,500
there's lots of elements to the crime

722
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:19,950
but basically if you post bad pictures

723
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,780
or post racy pictures out in public and

724
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,660
be aware North Carolina has got you

725
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,129
covered under the revenge porn law

726
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,720
there's also solicitation of child by

727
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,730
computer hopefully we don't have to deal

728
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,650
with this at all this is just one of the

729
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,570
laws under computer crime there is

730
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,640
banning the use of social networks by

731
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,070
sex offenders to me this was kind of an

732
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,530
interesting law because you don't even

733
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:43,350
have to do anything wrong but if you're

734
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:45,960
a registered sex offender and you get

735
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,939
found out that you're going into don't

736
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,630
ask me why that's which if you're going

737
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,780
into social media sites and you're doing

738
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:56,340
it for the purpose of following someone

739
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:58,050
that you shouldn't be following and you

740
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,820
get brought into court this is what gets

741
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,810
applied and basically says you can't go

742
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:06,629
to social media sites anymore on K and

743
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:09,440
this is why uh accessing computers

744
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:13,530
damaging computers this is the same CFA

745
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,050
nipa or nip EO and then finally there

746
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:19,440
was a cyber bullying law which I found

747
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:22,260
pretty interesting from a civil rights

748
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,630
perspective because cyber bullying

749
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,220
there's that fine line between the First

750
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:30,360
Amendment and what you can say online

751
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:33,740
and then what you can do related to an

752
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,090
individual it was struck down in 2016 as

753
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,490
unconstitutional by the North Carolina

754
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:42,510
Supreme Court so if you've heard of that

755
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:45,080
law it's no longer active now that being

756
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,970
said why should you care again already

757
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,230
apex woman first charged and I picked

758
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,790
the woman because I thought this was

759
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,600
fascinating that a woman was the first

760
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,299
charged under

761
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,428
revenge porn law I thought for certain

762
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,830
there'd be like 80 guys charged under

763
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:02,250
North Carolina's revenge porn law but no

764
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:05,668
it was a woman believe it or not a state

765
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,740
legislator is actually being brought up

766
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:10,890
on charges of cyber stalking right now

767
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,400
because of a custody case for his

768
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:16,650
children which is just you know like how

769
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,260
these laws get applied sometimes it just

770
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:21,330
is fascinating employees filed suit

771
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,600
against a BB so in North Carolina

772
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:29,668
there's a data breach identity theft

773
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:31,770
case in the works basically it's going

774
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:33,630
to be pretty high dollar and if you take

775
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,690
a look at the North Carolina federal

776
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:40,770
court has allowed a treble damages in

777
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:43,289
other words triple damages claim in an

778
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:45,840
employee data breach I mentioned that

779
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:48,030
the laws have both a customer focus and

780
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,709
employee focus this one is unusual in

781
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,389
that it focuses on the employees when it

782
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,580
comes comes to consumers courts are very

783
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,080
quick to say we're gonna give you lots

784
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:58,080
of money or we're gonna we're gonna make

785
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:01,949
sure there's recompense and not always

786
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,840
the case with employees so we've got

787
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,640
federal covered we've got state covered

788
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,350
and like I said I think state is

789
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,919
actually the most relevant in some ways

790
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:13,949
to our personal lives but foreign law is

791
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:17,190
becoming more and more important and

792
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:19,859
I've got all these countries covered the

793
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:22,109
reality is is that there is one that is

794
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:24,690
going to affect us it is affecting us it

795
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:26,940
is going to affect us even more and you

796
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:29,149
all know what it is its GDP our it's the

797
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:37,230
general data protection regulation of

798
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:40,710
the EU and writ large it says we want to

799
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,629
give the right of personal data the

800
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,790
right to control that personal data back

801
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:46,799
to the people who it is actually

802
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:50,820
concerning so it's the individual and

803
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,040
this comes from the EU which tends to

804
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,260
have a more what I would call principles

805
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,380
based approach to the law the United

806
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,960
States bases our law primarily on what's

807
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,790
been done before so it's like which one

808
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,770
is not like the other one and

809
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:07,230
and this one's outside of that well it's

810
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,700
that a good thing or a bad thing it's a

811
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,530
bad thing okay so we're gonna go back to

812
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,710
which ones like the other one you know

813
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:18,630
it's very very precedent oriented as as

814
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:20,400
was the UK but the EU I went to study

815
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,290
from when I was in law school I went to

816
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,640
study over in Germany for a summer and

817
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,320
one thing that I found fascinating about

818
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,390
their law there was they start from a

819
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,480
principle of or they start from a

820
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:33,000
principle and they say we believe the

821
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,030
following we believe that this is right

822
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,830
and in this case GDP are basically says

823
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:41,310
we believe that individuals have a right

824
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:43,500
to control what gets put out about them

825
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:46,200
or what gets collected about them and so

826
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,470
they pass a bunch of regulations or laws

827
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:52,319
that are specific to that GD P R says

828
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:55,950
something that the individual has a

829
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,860
right to opt out if you collect data on

830
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,689
a resident of the EU it's not

831
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,330
necessarily a citizen of the U but a

832
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:07,440
resident of you that you are obligated

833
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:09,240
to give them the option to opt out even

834
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,860
if they opt out you still have to

835
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,419
provide them service which is

836
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,740
interesting because if you don't know

837
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,290
anything about them how are you supposed

838
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,930
to provide them service but obviously

839
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:21,930
there's ways of doing it they have the

840
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:23,910
ability to request a right of Oratia or

841
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,620
they have a right of erasure of the data

842
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:29,490
that you're collecting about them in

843
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,410
addition you also have the ability of

844
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,930
providing that data that you collect

845
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,370
about them in a portable format so that

846
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,020
if they want to use that and go

847
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,759
somewhere else with that information or

848
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,420
even just to know what's being collected

849
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,970
about them they have that right

850
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,370
additionally they have the ability or

851
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:50,160
they have the right to understand what

852
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,470
you're collecting as well as every

853
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,779
single use that you're putting that data

854
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:58,220
to so say for example as a u.s.

855
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:01,500
corporation which a lot of us work for

856
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:04,230
you go to a website they ask for your

857
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,940
name okay great you have to be able to

858
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,760
tell them why you're collecting that

859
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,740
name and if that name collection is not

860
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,010
specific to the individual but it's

861
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,810
actually more of an aggregate sort of

862
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,770
informational collection they need to

863
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,500
understand that

864
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,450
- if there's something specific - why

865
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,880
that information is being collected for

866
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,470
example marketing you have to say we're

867
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,740
going to be marketing to you and we want

868
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:31,709
to market specifically to you so it's a

869
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:36,779
pretty broad reaching law and already

870
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:39,510
once again why do we care we care

871
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,060
because Google was just fined 50 million

872
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:45,150
euros because they did a cruddy job of

873
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,190
implementing gdpr protections what did

874
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,720
they say when they were confronted hey

875
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,520
we've been spending the past year and a

876
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,980
half trying to set things up so that

877
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,320
we're compliant with gdpr law now if

878
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,460
Google can't do it and Google's got some

879
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,600
of the smartest minds on the planet

880
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,370
working for him

881
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,520
do you really think your company is

882
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:05,460
going to be gdpr compliant the one

883
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,009
benefit or the one nice thing about what

884
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,380
we do for a living is that information

885
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:12,390
security has a carve out under gdpr it's

886
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,390
actually required to have an information

887
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:17,100
security program of some variety and as

888
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:21,120
part of that they understand that you

889
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:23,040
have to collect data that being said if

890
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,529
you collect the data and you apply

891
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,770
negligent practices to storing that data

892
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:31,590
or using that data you can probably be

893
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:33,690
prosecuted or you can be fined what does

894
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:37,550
that mean do you encrypt the data at

895
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:40,650
rest do you encrypt the data in transit

896
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:41,940
let's see I'm going to go into the risks

897
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,010
of the road because this kind of ties

898
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,800
into that right away

899
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,720
the privacy in data breach risk is huge

900
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,970
right we all know about it we all seen

901
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,310
it in the news and part of what gdpr

902
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:56,310
said is the middle bullet there which is

903
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,140
you need to consider using encryption

904
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,700
and in fact a lot of the state laws that

905
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:05,040
I mentioned talked about having to

906
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:06,960
encrypt things at rest or in transit the

907
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,740
under the data sovereignty risks I'm not

908
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,980
actually going to go through them

909
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,870
afterwards but gdpr mentions data

910
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,260
abstraction they actually call it data

911
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:21,170
pseudonym ization say that like 10 times

912
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:25,560
fast it's making it difficult for an

913
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:28,200
individual to re-identify someone from

914
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,540
the data set that you have it's not to

915
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:33,480
make it impossible but it's to make it

916
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,730
now I would say that in general there's

917
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,280
an anima zation which is taking that

918
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,680
data and making sure you can't figure

919
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,750
out who it was in the first place and

920
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,470
then their pseudonym ization and then

921
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:48,920
there's just raw storage of information

922
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:50,459
so the risks of the road you've got data

923
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,580
data breach

924
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,080
identity theft privacy I think the loss

925
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:58,830
of privacy over the course of the last

926
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,319
50 years has been extensive to say the

927
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,940
least but it's been primarily focused

928
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,619
all the laws been primarily focused on

929
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,420
the customer side and in fact almost

930
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:09,570
everything I talked about started from a

931
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:12,390
consumer oriented perspective that is

932
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:14,070
changing more laws and lawsuits are

933
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,290
being brought forth on behalf of the

934
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,930
employee and what gets done with their

935
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:21,750
information and so be aware of that

936
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,160
because as information security

937
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,440
professionals a lot of what we're doing

938
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,680
is we're monitoring what's going on in

939
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:34,560
the workplace and what our employees are

940
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:37,200
doing and ironically a lot of what we do

941
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,759
for a living is authorized under

942
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,129
something known as the Electronic

943
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,660
Communications Privacy Act or ECPA it

944
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:47,190
wasn't even a lie mentioned before

945
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:48,690
because frankly it was a law that was

946
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,609
passed to protect people from the

947
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,560
interception of electronic

948
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:54,150
communications so it was specifically

949
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,450
put into place to protect people from

950
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:59,099
having someone step in between and say

951
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,560
oh that's the email you're passing to

952
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,170
this person but the irony is one of the

953
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,089
exceptions to it is a huge exception for

954
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,490
business which says if you own the

955
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:10,560
property that the employee is using you

956
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:14,459
have a right to monitor it hence why we

957
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,349
can do what we do for a living so I

958
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,570
think that you're gonna see a huge risk

959
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:20,280
over the course little next probably

960
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:23,030
five years you're gonna see an increased

961
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,320
growth of employee oriented suits

962
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:28,320
encryption obviously is more important

963
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,230
and also retention you see laws with

964
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,599
maximum retention dates or retention

965
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,550
time specified you haven't seen a lot

966
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,800
that have a minimum retention time

967
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:39,930
specified as information security

968
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,290
professionals consider how long you need

969
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,830
to retain that data to prove out to keep

970
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,980
the evidence

971
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:48,600
of what's occurred for a given incident

972
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,400
one one thing you may want to do is you

973
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,920
may want to as you're writing the play

974
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,440
also write up and document clearly

975
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,330
document why you need to store data for

976
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,820
as long as you do because when it comes

977
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:01,590
time to go to court you can say the

978
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,230
reason we stored this data for as long

979
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:06,660
as we did which was of course less than

980
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,370
the maximum time specified by law but

981
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:11,009
the reason we stored it for six months

982
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:14,509
versus two weeks because this could be

983
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,510
touched up honed by gdpr

984
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:25,350
okay gentleman said that the Kalia law

985
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,940
has a or the Kalia Act has a minimum

986
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:29,460
specified and I'm sure there are some

987
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,160
that have minimums but it's not one that

988
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,390
I've seen specified very often yet which

989
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,069
I always find interesting it's like

990
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:37,080
we're worried about how long we retain

991
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,660
it but not about the minimum on a time

992
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,940
we retain it in some ways that's

993
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,060
actually more important for example in

994
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,970
criminal law the police officer cams

995
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:51,870
when they're going in and arresting

996
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:53,220
somebody there are a lot of regulations

997
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,290
on the books that basically don't

998
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,500
specify how long they can hold that data

999
00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:00,870
and it's you know that's a huge civil

1000
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,090
rights privacy issue as far as I'm

1001
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:06,990
concerned a data sovereignty risks

1002
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:09,690
you've got abstraction and automation

1003
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:12,839
sedimentation the locus of the personal

1004
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:17,460
data where it gets stored Germany France

1005
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:19,290
Russia China portions of the GDP are

1006
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,750
specified basically if you're collecting

1007
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:24,090
data about someone in Russia Russia is

1008
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:26,880
now saying we want you to keep that data

1009
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:28,980
in Russia China is the same way France

1010
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,920
is the same way a lot of the work that I

1011
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,960
do is around cloud security architecture

1012
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,920
and I'm seeing that more and more where

1013
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,750
more of the projects that come up okay

1014
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,520
how do we architect things in such a way

1015
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,010
so that we can perform information

1016
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,900
monitoring but it has to be over in this

1017
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:48,690
country and things can't leave the

1018
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,240
country that's a huge risk both in terms

1019
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,510
of business cost business opportunity

1020
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,620
lost legal exposure I mean that's that

1021
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,450
juncture I was talk

1022
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,400
about that all of these touch planet but

1023
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,109
that kind of data sovereignty risk is

1024
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,420
gonna be huge over the course of the

1025
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:06,480
next couple of years and obviously as I

1026
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,640
mentioned control of personal data some

1027
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,220
other risks surveillance risks this is

1028
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,190
more on the employee side we all know we

1029
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,830
can monitor computers email messaging

1030
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:18,720
blah blah blah that list as you notice

1031
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:21,270
the further down it goes when you get to

1032
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,890
GPS and social media those are where the

1033
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,509
law cases are occurring right now and

1034
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,520
this is the cool stuff I mean from a

1035
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:29,490
legal perspective if you're a legal geek

1036
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:33,240
is the questions you have to ask

1037
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:35,370
yourself are is the person on company

1038
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,549
time is the person using company

1039
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:41,220
equipment is the topic by which they're

1040
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,570
discussing a company oriented one and is

1041
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,000
it one that's covered under the First

1042
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,650
Amendment there's a lot of issues there

1043
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,780
was a case that was brought up where

1044
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,780
five people went out onto the internet

1045
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:54,060
they were all co-workers they were all

1046
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,400
discussing work they were discussing

1047
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,750
work about an upcoming meeting and yet

1048
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,460
even though they were discussing it

1049
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:01,160
because someone said something negative

1050
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,150
about the company they were terminated

1051
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,759
first thing that turns around

1052
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,430
they got terminated they sued so there's

1053
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,930
gonna be more cases like that where

1054
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:12,770
people go it we all know that companies

1055
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:15,690
go out and research us on social media

1056
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:17,220
my social media I try to make it as

1057
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:20,340
entertaining as possible so I'm more

1058
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,109
likely to get hired but I'm joking if

1059
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:26,820
you look out there there's I'm pretty

1060
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:29,790
boring but I think that's a huge risk in

1061
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:32,700
the future is that it's a risk from both

1062
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:34,710
sides it's a risk from the perspective

1063
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,600
of the company and what they do and

1064
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,340
whether or not it's against the law and

1065
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,500
the lawsuits that it's going to incur

1066
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,970
and it's also a risk from our personal

1067
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,430
side right we're giving up privacy

1068
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:46,230
whether or not we post something even if

1069
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,819
it's out in public because say for

1070
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:51,510
example if I'm with a group of guys and

1071
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,700
we go toss in a beer and we sit and talk

1072
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:57,630
about work and that gets overheard by

1073
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:59,339
somebody that's still in public didn't

1074
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,560
used to be a lawsuit about it right what

1075
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:04,200
used to happen is the guys being an

1076
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:06,960
idiot he's drunk you know whatever and

1077
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,240
you didn't get terminated social media

1078
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,860
it stays in writing

1079
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,330
you can essentially look it up and I

1080
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,160
think that's why companies are concerned

1081
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:17,370
is because it affects their reputation

1082
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,259
in a much more long-lasting effect the

1083
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,210
ECPA I mentioned about the fact that

1084
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:23,700
monitoring is allowed under it the

1085
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,410
enforcement continuum is also a risk of

1086
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,410
the road in the sense that there are

1087
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:30,480
laws and there are jurisdictions that

1088
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,819
have a laissez-faire approach to law

1089
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,910
enforcement related to computer crime

1090
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,320
like yeah Computer Crime it happens but

1091
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:41,250
you know I'm really much more concerned

1092
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,840
with the serial rapist the you know

1093
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,460
thefts that are going on the murders

1094
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,620
that are going on and so that's pretty

1095
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,570
low priority for us and then there are

1096
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,759
the other states or the other localities

1097
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,980
that are totally different they're like

1098
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,540
oh god no computer crime that's bad and

1099
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,330
that's the worst thing in the world so

1100
00:46:54,540 --> 00:47:01,380
we're gonna kill it we're going okay

1101
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:03,750
maybe prosecute everyone go maybe a

1102
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:07,710
little overboard there some other risks

1103
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:09,840
of the road if you're into if you're

1104
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,790
into the cloud at all there's a shared

1105
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,250
responsibility model and to me that

1106
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:17,790
shared responsibility model is an

1107
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:21,120
opportunity for huge lawsuits because

1108
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:23,430
you've got the CSP or the MSP which is

1109
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,859
the cloud service provider or the

1110
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,240
managed service provider that says we're

1111
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,860
gonna take care of this portion and

1112
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,339
we're responsible for this portion and

1113
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:35,970
anything outside of that is all you and

1114
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:38,640
yet if you sign up with them they send

1115
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:41,730
you notices about bad things going on

1116
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,279
within their resources that are at your

1117
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:48,300
level above where they're supposed to be

1118
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:50,460
monitoring and so they're also under an

1119
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:54,000
obligation if it's a clear violation of

1120
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:56,310
the law to notify the authorities so not

1121
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,230
only are you supposed to report they're

1122
00:47:56,310 --> 00:48:00,330
supposed to report what happens when

1123
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:02,340
they report before you report or you

1124
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:05,600
miss it you don't report and they report

1125
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:08,730
are you legally liable at that point

1126
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,529
another risk related to that your legal

1127
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:12,270
privilege let's say you don't encrypt

1128
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:16,590
everything on disk when you're storing

1129
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:19,620
it in the cloud they meaning the CSP or

1130
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:21,090
MSP can be legally compelled to provide

1131
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,960
the information of

1132
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:26,760
what they have in terms of resources and

1133
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,310
documents and that does that also mean

1134
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:31,290
that they can be legally compelled to

1135
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:34,560
present information that is within the

1136
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:36,360
resources that they provide to you but

1137
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,160
you are responsible for configuring but

1138
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:41,160
have configured poorly so they can see

1139
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,600
them legal cases are going to be decided

1140
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,220
over the course of the next five years

1141
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:48,060
you don't want your company being the

1142
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:49,950
one that has all the documents thrown

1143
00:48:48,060 --> 00:49:03,060
out into discovery that we're sitting in

1144
00:48:49,950 --> 00:49:05,129
the cloud plus yep go ahead I haven't

1145
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:07,350
seen that so far most of them are just

1146
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:09,840
at the level of encryption would be a

1147
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:12,810
really good encryption would be a really

1148
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:17,130
good idea now there are some standards

1149
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:20,100
that are enforced one thing that I

1150
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:23,130
didn't really discuss its FedRAMP and I

1151
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:25,230
deal a lot with FedRAMP and so FedRAMP

1152
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,880
relies upon something called the NIST

1153
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:30,030
standards and I'm sure you guys have all

1154
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,490
heard about it the 800-53 and so FedRAMP

1155
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:34,680
uses that as the standards that if you

1156
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:37,169
want to do business with the federal

1157
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,210
government in the cloud you effectively

1158
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:41,070
have to follow the FedRAMP standards and

1159
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:42,500
you have to go through a FedRAMP program

1160
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:45,930
you get something known as an

1161
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,030
authorization to operator an ATO and as

1162
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,230
part of that encryption is required but

1163
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,270
they don't specify they just say

1164
00:49:49,230 --> 00:50:05,730
encryption is really good you have to go

1165
00:49:51,270 --> 00:50:10,050
do it okay I think you know that's a

1166
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:12,060
good question I think that I think it

1167
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:14,310
would be challenging based on the Terms

1168
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,320
of agreement or the the contract that

1169
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,759
you sign with them they probably have a

1170
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,160
provision in that they are not

1171
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,290
responsible for providing anything that

1172
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,330
it's all your responsibility from your

1173
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:26,730
level on up and the only things that

1174
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:29,250
they are going to be compellable for by

1175
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:30,990
you for discovery purposes now the

1176
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,060
reality is it can go much broader than

1177
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,828
but is they're probably going to try to

1178
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,509
limit their

1179
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:38,959
ability to just those things that they

1180
00:50:35,509 --> 00:50:40,489
directly control and they're pretty it's

1181
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:42,799
pretty sweet for them because they're

1182
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:44,479
providing a service and yet they're in

1183
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:47,420
such high demand that they can basically

1184
00:50:44,479 --> 00:50:51,439
have some really unreasonable and people

1185
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:52,940
just sign off on it so I think there are

1186
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,579
two other risks that you need to be

1187
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,529
aware of you have all the risks that you

1188
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:59,180
are subject to but when you're dealing

1189
00:50:57,529 --> 00:51:00,829
with cloud service provider you have to

1190
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:03,700
also consider you have to go through due

1191
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:06,859
diligence and see how they also protect

1192
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:09,169
themselves in their portion of the stack

1193
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:11,719
for all of those things and finally

1194
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:13,609
increasing complexity I'm talking about

1195
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:17,150
the intersection of business information

1196
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:19,038
security and law that's complex each one

1197
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,630
of the groups is complex there's lots of

1198
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:22,969
complexity related to all of that

1199
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:24,499
there's lots of room and it's only

1200
00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:26,690
getting worse there's lots of room for

1201
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:30,348
gaps so you're going to continue to see

1202
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:32,140
more and more lawsuits so looking ahead

1203
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:34,700
how do you take charge of your driving

1204
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,969
well first of all I'm gonna say the

1205
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,739
thing that everyone says bla bla bla

1206
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:41,329
establish an incident response plan and

1207
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:45,829
the playbook

1208
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:47,869
I am neither promoting nor endorsing I

1209
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:51,199
am using as an example this book here

1210
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:53,269
which is crafting the InfoSec playbook

1211
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:56,089
this is a great example of how to do it

1212
00:51:53,269 --> 00:51:58,160
it's not necessarily if one size fits

1213
00:51:56,089 --> 00:52:00,619
all but it gives you all the principles

1214
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,390
and you need to understand when it comes

1215
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:04,849
time for a lawsuit or when it comes time

1216
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:06,499
to prosecute somebody with the evidence

1217
00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:08,269
that you've collected you need to

1218
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:10,848
understand what your chain of custody

1219
00:52:08,269 --> 00:52:13,038
program is you need to have that defined

1220
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:14,630
you can't like make it up on the fly

1221
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:17,089
because when you bring that evidence

1222
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,069
into court and they say well how can you

1223
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:22,819
prove control of this evidence from

1224
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:27,199
point A to point Z and you can't gets

1225
00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:29,329
tossed out and there goes your case so

1226
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,430
design systems with the future in mind

1227
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:33,559
right so if you're seeing words like

1228
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:35,419
encryption being defined now you'd

1229
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:37,130
certainly need to start being using it

1230
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:39,199
but you also need to consider the needs

1231
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:41,690
of the future is there a way you can

1232
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:42,650
protect data in a way that maybe is

1233
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,589
forward-thinking

1234
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:47,640
for example just sitting and doing

1235
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:51,360
getting ready for this present

1236
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,910
I was thinking it would be best not only

1237
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,130
do you anonymize data where possible and

1238
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,290
you pseudonym eyes data where possible

1239
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:00,300
you also setup not just an our back

1240
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:01,890
system where its role based but you've

1241
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,750
set up one where it requires more than

1242
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:06,660
one person to re-identify

1243
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:09,390
so an executive can't go in and find

1244
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:11,100
information about a consumer or an

1245
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:13,830
information security professional can't

1246
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:16,799
say oh hey like that guy is pretty hot

1247
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:18,360
I'm gonna look up his address can't do

1248
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,160
it you'd need two people to be involved

1249
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:23,010
in I'm saying either direction I was

1250
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,370
using a generic example there pardon me

1251
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:29,220
that's my legal background please don't

1252
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:31,920
send don't sue okay

1253
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,560
white hat hacking is alive and well yes

1254
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,790
lots of classes out there are you

1255
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,850
violating the law

1256
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:40,770
very possibly so you talk about hacking

1257
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:43,290
all during this conference and the

1258
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:45,180
reality is when you sign here or when

1259
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:47,130
you sign off on the agreement with your

1260
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,230
company to use the equipment you

1261
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:51,720
probably also agreed not to scan the

1262
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:54,870
network you probably so you can't use

1263
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:56,970
nmap you can't even do a telnet to a

1264
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:58,350
port if it's for the purpose of figuring

1265
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,000
out whether or not that port is

1266
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:01,680
available now the reality is are you

1267
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,060
going to be prosecuted especially as an

1268
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,879
information security professional

1269
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:08,640
probably not but be aware what you're

1270
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,860
agreeing to has legal effect and it's

1271
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,150
not necessarily when you're doing it but

1272
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,680
it could be a year or two down the road

1273
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,570
were you doing different totally

1274
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,250
different responsibilities and some

1275
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,580
court case comes up and they said did

1276
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:23,040
you scan the network well yeah

1277
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:24,960
were you allowed to well I worked in

1278
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,529
information security did your duties

1279
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,420
require that you scan that particular

1280
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:33,270
device no okay

1281
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,710
thank you next and I mean that's the

1282
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,509
kind of thing that happens in court is

1283
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:39,000
cross examination and these very

1284
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:41,610
specific questions what you're doing it

1285
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,960
only takes a single mistake to make it

1286
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:46,920
to make a court case go the wrong way

1287
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,440
reflect on the security versus privacy

1288
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,150
balance for me this is huge I'm always

1289
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,890
sitting and thinking about what I'm

1290
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:56,910
doing and whether or not it's going to

1291
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:59,430
impact someone's privacy I I hate to

1292
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,899
think that the systems I set up are

1293
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:02,940
destroying the fundamental

1294
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,710
privacy of the people that I work with

1295
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,600
right I don't want to be thinking that

1296
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:09,600
you know this guy here I'm I'm

1297
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,960
collecting data about him and other

1298
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:15,990
people can look at that data and make

1299
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:17,730
judgments and decisions about his life I

1300
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:20,910
pick him out specifically because I know

1301
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:22,830
him but you take a look at it and you go

1302
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:25,230
D is this something we really want other

1303
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,819
people doing about us anything you do

1304
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,710
and anything you set up think about how

1305
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:33,990
it would affect you if it was applied to

1306
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:36,990
you some final bits of advice SiC seek

1307
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:38,220
legal counsel when necessary and I'm not

1308
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,509
saying that because I'm an attorney

1309
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:41,220
because you're never going to talk to me

1310
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:44,660
I mean the reality is the people that

1311
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:47,609
come up to me say things like hey I've

1312
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:49,609
you know had a speeding ticket do you

1313
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,990
know any good speeding ticket lawyers

1314
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:53,460
I'm buying a house anything I need to

1315
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,600
consider you know they come up to me

1316
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,640
with things like that no one's gonna

1317
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,830
come up to me and say hey I'm getting

1318
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:03,299
sued for you know looking at

1319
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:06,330
inappropriate images online it's the

1320
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:08,910
type of thing you wanted to have a

1321
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:11,640
relationship with counsel before you run

1322
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:14,190
into an instant so and if you hit an

1323
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,279
issue that is way beyond your expertise

1324
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:19,530
don't solve problem right don't do what

1325
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,270
we do for our jobs don't try to solve

1326
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:23,670
the problem yourself don't go online and

1327
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:26,070
do research and say oh here's where the

1328
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:28,080
law is I understand the law I guarantee

1329
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:29,760
you don't part of going to law school is

1330
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,890
understanding that the mentality of a

1331
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,530
lawyer they can use the exact same words

1332
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:36,900
as you and does not mean the same thing

1333
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:40,470
and that's that's my best bit of advice

1334
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:43,550
is lawyers don't say what you say they

1335
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:48,899
can use the same words and it's like

1336
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:52,110
that finally make three or more friends

1337
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:53,280
and my wife knows when I was telling her

1338
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:56,880
about that she looked at me and she said

1339
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,190
you are such a geek because you don't

1340
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,340
make friends with these people I said

1341
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:04,980
well this is a relative thing right make

1342
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:07,140
sure you know who inside counsel is talk

1343
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,520
to him say I'm part of the information

1344
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,650
security program is there anything I can

1345
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,180
do to help support you more importantly

1346
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,620
is there anything I need to do if I'm

1347
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,500
bringing

1348
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,940
case and if you're not responsible for

1349
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,260
that if you're an analyst or an

1350
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,910
investigator where you're at a pretty

1351
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,580
low level and you're not actually going

1352
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:24,620
to be contacting counsel understand what

1353
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:26,480
that chain is who are you going to be

1354
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:29,299
contacting or who are you going to be

1355
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,010
passing this information off to if it's

1356
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,120
inside counsel make sure you know who

1357
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:35,180
they are and make sure you have a good

1358
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:37,100
relationship with them also law

1359
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:39,379
enforcement don't call them up on the

1360
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:41,240
phone say hi I'm Wayne Schmidt I just

1361
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,860
like to let you know I I kind of like to

1362
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:46,310
know who you are and your I want you to

1363
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:48,290
be my friend not like that but know who

1364
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:50,420
your local law enforcement is and maybe

1365
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:52,700
consider going to events that they hold

1366
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,800
they talk about cybersecurity I do that

1367
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,689
periodically I go to something called

1368
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,310
InfraGard where they have the FBI

1369
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:00,500
presenting topics of cybersecurity

1370
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:02,840
interest just having that relationship

1371
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:06,440
and knowing who the people are will help

1372
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:09,080
and finally know who outside console is

1373
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:11,300
and this is the most important part is

1374
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,920
there are times where investigations

1375
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,960
will require what's known as an arm's

1376
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,640
length transaction meaning that the

1377
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,710
person you're dealing with or the group

1378
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,140
that you're dealing with is not directly

1379
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:25,460
beholden to anyone in your organization

1380
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:28,009
so the legal appearance of that is one

1381
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,830
of propriety in other words they don't

1382
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:33,650
have any buy-in and they don't have any

1383
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:35,960
advantage to keeping the data that

1384
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:38,270
they're keeping and presenting things

1385
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,130
the way that they're presenting how

1386
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:42,590
would it look if I as an information

1387
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:47,000
security professional report in to a

1388
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:51,680
director who is investigating who is

1389
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,830
beholden to a InfoSec VP that info SEC

1390
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,080
VP is the one that's being investigated

1391
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:59,540
that whole chain of investigation could

1392
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:01,190
be suspect based on that kind of it's

1393
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,390
just the appearance of impropriety we

1394
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:04,670
could all be doing our jobs

1395
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:06,799
I'd want outside counsel in at that

1396
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:09,170
point because it's a very difficult

1397
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,120
situation for an individual in our

1398
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,950
business to be investigating somebody

1399
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,900
that they either report to or have a

1400
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:18,680
direct direct line responsibility

1401
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:20,960
anyways those are some of the ways you

1402
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:23,120
can help your driving

1403
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,760
improve on the legal roads and I've

1404
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:56,210
identified some of the risks and dangers

1405
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:58,430
does anyone have any questions the

1406
00:59:56,210 --> 01:00:01,550
question was basically what was the law

1407
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:03,649
number do you know if it was a House

1408
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:07,190
bill Senate bill okay

1409
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:09,740
327 it was it was a California law ether

1410
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:12,550
a House bill or Senate bill 327 that

1411
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:15,229
talks about standards being applied to

1412
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:18,830
manufacturers for IOT devices no I

1413
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:21,140
haven't read it not surprising that the

1414
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:23,000
amount of law now existing about

1415
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:26,690
cybersecurity is just like phenomenally

1416
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,190
large but that being said I think that

1417
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:31,250
laws like that tend to get passed

1418
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:33,920
initially and they either like much like

1419
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:36,500
the PCI DSS standard will point to a

1420
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,600
standard that they can use or they tend

1421
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,180
to fail or have to get rewritten over

1422
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,279
time it's like the initial law is always

1423
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:45,680
like this is really bad we need to do

1424
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,330
something about this and then people

1425
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,129
come in afterwards and they say okay

1426
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:51,140
amendment this amendment this amendment

1427
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:55,750
this and it usually takes a year or two

1428
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,750
to you know shake things out if you will

1429
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:06,040
the question was why is an irk known as

1430
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:10,129
a narc I have no idea

1431
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:11,500
now the know there we go no one likes a

1432
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:15,340
narc

1433
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,340
any other questions

1434
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:32,230
jurisdiction

1435
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:43,640
title 10 dollars for sale you can take

1436
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,640
from the port Virginia and get judgement

1437
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:54,150
Ukraine or the gentleman was saying that

1438
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:58,650
Virginia has a law about spam where if

1439
01:01:54,150 --> 01:02:01,110
the law if the spam reaches a person in

1440
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,850
Virginia then at that point there that

1441
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:05,700
Virginia essentially has jurisdiction

1442
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:08,779
over it and can find you a mail server

1443
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:11,549
in Virginia can find you $10 per spam

1444
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:15,600
but the issue and I would agree the

1445
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:17,460
issue is enforcement you can say

1446
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,520
anything you like but like you said if

1447
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:22,020
the if the spammer is in Russia now what

1448
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,850
might be interesting is whether or not

1449
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:26,190
they start prosecuting upstream

1450
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:27,299
basically whether or not I'm interested

1451
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,980
in seeing over the next few years

1452
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:31,770
whether or not the people who are

1453
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,570
passing that traffic are going to be

1454
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:37,740
responsible because there seems to be an

1455
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:40,380
increased desire to have visibility into

1456
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:42,419
the traffic at the same time that

1457
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,490
there's an increased push for an

1458
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,230
encryption how and and you know in

1459
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:48,299
construct increasingly strong in

1460
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:53,640
cryptographic controls on the traffic

1461
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:56,540
going out on the Internet so all right

1462
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,540
thank you very much folks
