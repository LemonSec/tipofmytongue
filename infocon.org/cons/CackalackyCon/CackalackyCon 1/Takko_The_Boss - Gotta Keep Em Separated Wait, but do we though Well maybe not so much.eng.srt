1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
um yeah so he's gonna make this joke

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,820
about how I'm actually here to talk

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,500
about the granulars in a history of

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,089
unshielded twisted-pair but i that would

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,940
set the bar low so anything I do after

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:27,060
that should be better so what we are

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:30,689
gonna do is start so the event that we

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,780
both came here for got to keep them

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:38,100
separated the words of offspring wait

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,320
but do we though maybe not so much so

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,890
let's find out with talk of the boss

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,360
that's me so first off just want to do a

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,850
quick intro who is this guy so Who am I

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,660
personal I do actually got my start in

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,219
software development

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,019
I do a lot of software build in my free

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,350
time and I got into security from

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,760
pivoting out of security engineering I'm

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,320
recently an ordained priest by the

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,459
church latter-day dude for those who

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,890
follow dudeism it's the non-theist

22
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,080
religion of the philosophy of Jeff the

like I'm going to lose half of you when

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:49,789
I tell you what team but alright more

35
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,789
agile age than I thought I'd receive

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,520
he had the American variety sorry I

37
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,009
should have specified so professionally

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,270
I'm a cybersecurity instructor at the

39
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:07,380
coders school and that's me teaching

40
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:10,049
something I had no hair now I do the

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,750
code of school learning code changed the

42
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,180
world we basically teach kids like eight

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,830
through 18 how to program how to really

44
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,870
do anything they want to a lot of gaming

45
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,030
a lot of Python a lot of C unity you see

46
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,370
sharp ubiquitous c-sharp jokes in there

47
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,160
and the chief information officer at

48
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,630
rapid cap and that's probably the most

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,290
professional you're ever gonna see me on

50
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,430
camera captured ever so rapidly cat who

51
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,380
we are is we are a financial analytics

52
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,780
platform and we aim to disrupt the Forex

53
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,060
of binary market by lowering the

54
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,799
intellectual barrier to entry so that

55
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,160
anybody with a couple brain cells can

56
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:53,730
really do some good work here and tap

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,560
into the biggest market the lead

58
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,690
security operations center architect at

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,519
Black Harbor cyber security and the

60
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,140
black Harbor cybersecurity is a

61
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,570
cybersecurity firm Bayside Detroit

62
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,750
Michigan we do cybersecurity for

63
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,160
automotive OEMs we have a pretty solid

64
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:14,150
foothold in the cyber to physical space

65
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:17,100
so everything that constitutes a cyber

66
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:20,730
action - physical reaction that's what

67
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,040
we do and as a former head of cyber

68
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,959
security services as same analytics and

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,870
former psychological operations

70
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,680
specialist in the army and we use a sock

71
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:34,829
that's me

72
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:37,650
same guy just no scarf no half so why my

73
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:40,950
peers speaking to you so I have

74
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:44,519
experience in a red team so application

75
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,988
mobile black box testing black box gray

76
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,420
box sunlight box for black box in the

77
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,310
sense the livery giving a black box and

78
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,828
say here do this

79
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,359
I've owner ability assessments in social

80
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,670
engineering campaigns against company

81
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,310
staffs that paid us to do so with

82
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,280
permission not just out of fun blue

83
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,020
team's side is sort of Simonton

84
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,870
implementation

85
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:10,260
built a number of systems utilizing the

86
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,700
elastic stack as the core to create a

87
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,340
security incident event management

88
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,409
platform physicians I've failed in

89
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,019
Security Operations Center an engineer

90
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,810
helping our security team basically

91
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,990
decrease their mean time to respond MTTR

92
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,950
and MT TDS I mean time to detect

93
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,040
analysts team lead to lead architect

94
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,860
which is what I do now and the Sebert of

95
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,530
physical side I got my start industrial

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,080
control systems so I did a vulnerability

97
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,330
assessment and pen test for a SCADA

98
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,680
Network SCADA is a supervisory control

99
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,719
and data acquisition for a major

100
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,150
metropolitan public transportation

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,740
system automated transportation think

102
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,419
like streetcars trams that kind of thing

103
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,650
I do a lot of research in my free time

104
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,270
regarding the realms of industrial

105
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,679
control systems and ot ot means

106
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,000
operational technology that is

107
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,140
nomenclature of an action I'm going to

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,190
be using a lot in this presentation I

109
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,590
also realized it to get all the content

110
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,500
into this time block I helped to talk

111
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,960
fast so if I lose anyone please just let

112
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,640
me know I'll try to slow down it also

113
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,590
automated tank gauges I recently got

114
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,450
that few months ago really interesting

115
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,859
that's something that people don't pay

116
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:23,969
attention to not sure why and what when

117
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,470
I talk about product promotions I don't

118
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,820
do a lot of product promotions I talk

119
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,230
about products I try not to because I

120
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,080
feel that if I do that's going to take

121
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,250
away from the confía substantial air

122
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,070
that I'm trying to get across I don't

123
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,930
want to become too much of a Salesman

124
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:45,240
the money granulars

125
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:49,290
of Newark crap on zip 0 0 3-5 scissors

126
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,150
or 3-6 I think we get the message these

127
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,950
are just a different regulatory and

128
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,840
compliance bodies that really if you're

129
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,210
going to be doing any kind of IPO T

130
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,669
convergence you should have all of these

131
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,479
covered so I put them in small yellow

132
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:05,580
text just to get a couple chuckles which

133
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,290
I did thank you

134
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,390
what will I talk about so industry 4.0 I

135
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:15,570
what is it what the problem is and what

136
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,950
the proposed perspective solutions are

137
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,480
and what I mean by that is I have a

138
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,050
couple

139
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,970
things I'm gonna show that it's not a

140
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,340
one size fit all but I do want to try

141
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,340
and help and get the mentality out there

142
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,229
regarding secure architecture for cyber

143
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,679
to physical integration between IT

144
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,120
systems and demos we're gonna do a

145
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,220
little bit of show dating so you can

146
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,530
kind of look yourself if you go home if

147
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,020
you want to so see what some vulnerable

148
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,450
nodes look like in regard so I'm going

149
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:48,770
to talk about we're gonna Rage Against

150
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:52,729
the Machine by severely messing up at

151
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:55,370
PLC lab we're gonna do some broker

152
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,990
mischief with the MQTT broker that's

153
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,890
gonna be the IOT portion and then we're

154
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:06,380
gonna be passing gas tanks automated

155
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:09,440
tank gauges so gonna build a little bit

156
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,350
of historical context to build up from

157
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,760
where we were to where we now are in as

158
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:18,770
far as history 4.0 so late 1700s the

159
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,140
beginning of in history 1.0 we have the

160
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:25,359
emergence of mechanization so we're

161
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:28,610
pivoting our core infrastructure of

162
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,300
agriculture and we are migrating to

163
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:34,760
industry so creating stuff and steam

164
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,560
engine with the creation the steam

165
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,690
engine subsequently we have to find ways

166
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,490
to extract feel faster so we're able to

167
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,820
increase the speed of which we can mine

168
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,230
coal and that's you know technological

169
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,770
introductions and advances all that

170
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:51,620
stuff and so material or human driven

171
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:54,380
exchanges being able to transport people

172
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,160
you know from going take a trip from one

173
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,200
place to another

174
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,970
also goods things that expired like meat

175
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,020
and so this also created the

176
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,610
foundational blueprints of how we have

177
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:13,099
factories and industrial facilities

178
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:14,390
today in a sense industry 2.0 late 1800s

179
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,050
blessing

180
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,050
plus again

181
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,520
I feel like that lasted was on purpose

182
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:30,779
where was that yes new energy and so gas

183
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,510
or electricity the introduction to the

184
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,429
combustion engine that kind of drove the

185
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,159
steel industry to have to increase to

186
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:40,010
create more combustion engines new

187
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,218
communication Telegraph and telephone

188
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,060
these are Brown breaking communicational

189
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,740
achievements that allows you know

190
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,199
message to be related from one place to

191
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,560
another obviously new transportation

192
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:58,130
automobile and plane we have industry

193
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:01,380
3.0 so the late 1900s 1969 so long ago

194
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,750
and we have the introduction of new

195
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,610
energy again in the form of nuclear we

196
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,760
have new electronics so transistors

197
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,910
microprocessors all that jazz then we

198
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,920
have telecommunications computers and we

199
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,890
revitalize the industry by the creation

200
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,479
of enhancing automation with creation of

201
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,360
robots and and programmable logic

202
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,329
controllers or PLC's it's the cool kids

203
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,339
saying so now where we are in now is

204
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:29,069
industry 4.0 right we have all this crap

205
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:33,120
going on so the nine pillars of industry

206
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,860
4.0 is it's no now first one is a

207
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,500
virtual and augmented reality the idea

208
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,570
to generate and create complex digital

209
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,640
environments to design a visual as

210
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,519
christian new products bless you

211
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,380
additive manufacturing that's actually

212
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,990
really cool is you're transforming how

213
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,490
many factoring is done normally you

214
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,230
start off with the source material and

215
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,610
you Whittle away and you chisel until it

216
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,360
becomes something that you want or I

217
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,459
like molding it early but this way using

218
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,019
3d printing of numerous materials are

219
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,010
actually building from the bottom up so

220
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,449
you're starting with that and that's

221
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,140
really that's really cool because you

222
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:09,120
don't waste materials it's pretty exact

223
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:13,069
Internet of Things we all know i OT is

224
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,850
does anybody not know what IOT is cool

225
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,500
how do you president network

226
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,630
everything's connected peripheral

227
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,600
intelligence track and behavior for

228
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:25,920
real-time monitoring analysis big data

229
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,600
so making new standards for a data

230
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,399
management by repeatable processes that

231
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,850
can be you know integrated into in

232
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,440
multiple environments

233
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,050
predictive analytics so statistical

234
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,139
algorithms machine learning cloud

235
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:40,569
computing so we all know what that is

236
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:44,319
advanced simulation being able to

237
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:46,719
visualize and simulate processes to get

238
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:48,370
the output and then you know kind of see

239
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,630
what works what doesn't there's more to

240
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,730
it than that I'm not doing enough

241
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,720
justice autonomous robots they can think

242
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:57,250
act and react and universal integration

243
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,139
so this is a really big one

244
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,670
communications between different systems

245
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:02,740
it's kind of a broad one but it's gonna

246
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,099
play a part a lot in this presentation

247
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,259
and cyber security because for industry

248
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,959
4.0 to grow and become something else

249
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,490
you need to have things secure so if

250
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,420
things aren't secure you can't really

251
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:19,540
expand so here's the problem

252
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:24,519
as its seen in the industry in as I as I

253
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:26,529
see it we have a large influx of

254
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,449
companies and entities that are rushing

255
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:32,259
to meet this industrial relevance right

256
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:35,380
so guide organizations companies I need

257
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:38,230
to meet industry 4.0 being able to take

258
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:42,639
part in these inter connective exchanges

259
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,829
and with that being said the creation

260
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,589
and development for tools in the realm

261
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,180
of cloud management and analytics and

262
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:51,579
all that kind of stuff combat so here we

263
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,899
have connected production I know if

264
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:55,000
that's a company that's just a tool name

265
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:58,839
but that's say I know that's an

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,829
industrial control system dashboard we

267
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,899
have here a home IOT dashboard it's a

268
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:08,319
little sample it's got a light switch

269
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:11,860
and temperature and all that and then we

270
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:14,290
have a ATG dashboard from same IT

271
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,990
solutions just to be able to look at

272
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,930
tank status and all that stuff and the

273
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,000
process kind of goes as follows pretty

274
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,008
much any meme that you see in here I sat

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,730
down and created some it might not be

276
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:29,439
that funny but I hope starts off with

277
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,410
the organization putting their stuff on

278
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:34,029
the internet is this I Tod convergence

279
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,089
this imagine there's a question mark

280
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:39,880
there I'd forgot to add that in and that

281
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,589
turns into the organization the

282
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,920
organization and the ball is a

283
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,449
cybersecurity right so the balls been

284
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,449
dropped like lots of balls have been

285
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:52,329
dropped lots of organizations have the

286
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:56,290
balls been dropped and then they end up

287
00:12:52,329 --> 00:13:01,540
falling flat on their face mmm that's

288
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:06,510
what happens so to get into is some

289
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:09,099
scary stats I leveraged

290
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:13,740
show Dane just like 20 minutes to gather

291
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:16,769
some numbers here so I can try and relay

292
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:20,980
so get a scary movie

293
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:22,209
ICSI I see SOT devices this few of these

294
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,420
a few categories of these that I've

295
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:29,609
found so Modbus PLC is utilizing the

296
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:35,370
Modbus protocol over 20,000 of those

297
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:40,930
Siemens devices either s7 PLC's or SCADA

298
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:43,809
devices or over 19,000 PLC's or devices

299
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,859
utilizing a dnp3 protocol is five over

300
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:51,969
500 same thing with tritium but it's

301
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:54,790
35,000 and BACnet almost 20,000 thousand

302
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,990
GE Industrial Solutions 78 that's

303
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,579
actually a little surprising to me

304
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,130
because they've been trying to get out

305
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:03,309
there with their products and devices

306
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:06,279
utilizing the IE the IEC is six oh seven

307
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:08,290
eight seven o - five - 104 protocol

308
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,420
that's over 1100

309
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,509
these are all just when you're working

310
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,459
with PLC's and ot devices you can have

311
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:17,410
different protocols but it's just you

312
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:19,329
know like like I showed you with all my

313
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:25,079
pictures in my intro you know different

314
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:28,839
hat same guy right so IOT MQTT brokers

315
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:31,059
so MQTT is protocol that a lot of IOT

316
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,139
devices used to communicate machine to

317
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:37,300
commissioning communication so

318
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,279
specifically I believe I did mosquito

319
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,859
mosquito mosquito and active and cure

320
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,399
the two most prolific and ubiquitous

321
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,870
ones out in the wild but it did MK tts

322
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,250
because it's easier it I actually sees a

323
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,500
lot more so it's about seventy nine

324
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:55,890
thousand and that's a lot

325
00:14:51,500 --> 00:15:00,510
and automated tank gauges a whopping

326
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:03,390
five grand but that's still a lot for

327
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:06,330
regarding the countries that you can see

328
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:11,069
or fill it in red I forgot what's next

329
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:14,100
oh yeah so we're gonna go ahead and do

330
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:19,010
some show dating just a couple things so

331
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:23,280
growing up my home state of Connecticut

332
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:24,540
didn't really have a lot of television

333
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,189
stations to watch because we can never

334
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,860
afford cables so a lot of things I watch

335
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,840
we're cooking shows I'm a huge fan of TV

336
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:36,210
magic so I have some TV magic

337
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:38,040
pre-prepared showed in things set up in

338
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,900
this I don't want to get I'm not going

339
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,000
to spend a lot of time in it but just to

340
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:47,579
show you where to look

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:52,620
it's how I gather the stats so there are

342
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:57,720
a large amount of protocols that are

343
00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:00,780
utilized and and we can see here so as

344
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,880
long as we don't do anything after just

345
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,540
looking at the showed an information

346
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:12,320
we're good so he currently overloaded I

347
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,319
guess that answers this question here

348
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:19,290
okay that is odd so if I can't load this

349
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:24,240
oh there we go

350
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:26,310
yeah sweet so let's take a look nearby

351
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,590
to where we are see if there's anything

352
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:31,380
in either Chapel Hill during a rally

353
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:37,860
that is openly exposed she just take me

354
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:44,990
a few minutes and maybe like one see we

355
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:44,990
are okay that's nowhere

356
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:55,230
I don't know what that is a better idea

357
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,059
to make this more streamlined as I'm

358
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,619
actually it's going to go back and we're

359
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:02,009
gonna take a quick look at the output of

360
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:08,490
what we have that way I don't kilt I

361
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:15,750
can't go back yes ya gon see it gone too

362
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:24,449
far I'm in too deep man we'll come back

363
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:26,459
to that so so poor 1883 is normally what

364
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,500
mqtt uses but there's also a couple

365
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,539
other things that use a so I had to

366
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,889
parse with the string of mqtt in the

367
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:36,360
output and so we can see right here

368
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:40,969
whatever this is in you know long Hong

369
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,289
Kong this is most likely an IOT broker

370
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,730
utilising is probably mosquito because

371
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:46,529
one thing I've noticed too while doing

372
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,830
research is a lot of the mosquito

373
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:51,389
brokers these are called topics so these

374
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,699
are like think of them almost like

375
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:58,590
directories for a command so i broker

376
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:02,580
clients maximum a control command might

377
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:04,470
be control you know give it an integer

378
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,260
MIT might increase the maximum something

379
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:10,169
like that I'm not an IOT expert but I

380
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,320
understand enough of MQTT to know how to

381
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:17,340
leverage it in a not so good manner for

382
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,490
professional purposes only and so this

383
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,260
is most likely a mosquito broker because

384
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,679
they normally begin with this dollar

385
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,000
sign sis I someone can correct me later

386
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,940
around if I'm wrong because I'm not

387
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,299
always right but most of time so here we

388
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,279
go

389
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,350
ActiveMQ you can see it begins with the

390
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,389
ActiveMQ string that sign has enacted mq

391
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,689
device and you have your different

392
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:41,668
topics after here not going to get too

393
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,669
much into that because I've got a lot

394
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:47,909
more to cover but yeah so gas tanks

395
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:50,639
let's go ahead and see gas stations near

396
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:51,809
us that are openly I really hope this

397
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:53,550
works if it doesn't work and I was going

398
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:56,580
to

399
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:58,169
on to the next thing so let's go ahead

400
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:05,310
and we see a gas station in Raleigh

401
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:08,490
North Carolina so if you the details of

402
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:11,340
it and we can see actually hey that's in

403
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,770
Durham we can see there's a gas station

404
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,679
on 200 James Street so the thing about

405
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:20,070
trying to identify

406
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,100
cyber-physical devices it's interesting

407
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,590
right because normally you can have a

408
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,360
company in New York and their web

409
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,560
servers coming out of California or

410
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,149
maybe they have a couple other ones just

411
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,040
to me like Geographic demands or

412
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,320
whatever with cyber to physical devices

413
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,889
you're actually getting the IP of when

414
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:42,480
that leaves the network so you're

415
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:44,790
getting if it's in so it's located in

416
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,240
Durham but we saw the I we saw where it

417
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:50,879
was geographically with the flat launch

418
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,730
whatever Chauvin uses we saw that in

419
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,350
Raleigh so whenever that that last hop

420
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,720
that goes to the open Internet after it

421
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,389
leaves whatever ISP boundaries that's

422
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,970
where we see it at so it's not super far

423
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:07,410
away radius pennyways what we can see

424
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:09,540
here is this is an automated tank gauge

425
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,030
that is open on the internet probably so

426
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,129
that some company has an 80 G manager

427
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,350
that you can log into and view all this

428
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:20,390
information essentially what this is

429
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:23,129
veida route is a automated tank gauge

430
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,230
that is prolifically used in a lot of

431
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,420
places and when people want to do remote

432
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,940
managing of it they opened the port

433
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,040
10,001 and it's essentially a telnet

434
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,440
engagement from there so if he can tell

435
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,050
that you can break into 80 G's now

436
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,230
granted you do have users and passwords

437
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:44,370
but there are some ways to get around it

438
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:46,340
I mean you can try dossing the ten

439
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,870
thousand zero one port and then keep

440
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,419
trying to log into it while it boots up

441
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:54,080
because I think the pass I think the

442
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,310
password the user authentication

443
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,169
whatever is in it I think runs last

444
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,490
something like that that's something I

445
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,830
came across during research I never

446
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:06,559
tried it because the whole legality

447
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:14,099
thing but so

448
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:22,189
yes yeah that old bugger so what I'm

449
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:28,069
gonna do here is I have I created a tool

450
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:31,229
called rapid fire when I did my first

451
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:34,188
industrial control that's the wrong one

452
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:34,189
hold on

453
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:46,909
I'll do it from here whatever means the

454
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:46,909
second gun that's that's not a command

455
00:21:49,189 --> 00:22:00,539
okay so I created a tool called rapid

456
00:21:53,279 --> 00:22:03,479
fire I created it because I needed a way

457
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:05,729
to quickly test the ability to do

458
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:08,069
holding register address value injection

459
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:10,489
and base to be able to flip bits and

460
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:14,188
coils on a programmable logic controller

461
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:15,569
so I decided that because like a lot of

462
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:18,389
this socket based tools out there like

463
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:21,869
MBT again you can only do them one at a

464
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:23,129
time and PLC's also have a lot of them

465
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:25,109
have a limit especially if you're using

466
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:29,879
the Modbus protocol that they can only

467
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:34,168
handle about a hundred 2425 requests at

468
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:39,498
once so I have a I hope I put it on high

469
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:46,319
I have a demo set up a demo PLC and

470
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:48,739
we're gonna do really quickly I do have

471
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,759
one more thing I have to open up which

472
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:52,229
was a bit of an oversight but I'm

473
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,669
actually making it a really good time

474
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:56,119
comparatively though from what I thought

475
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:56,119
so

476
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:18,360
okay I'm gonna go back to here go back

477
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,580
in here so I'm gonna do is really

478
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:25,649
quickly just show you when we query the

479
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:30,720
PLC and ask it what it what it has in it

480
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:45,750
I can show you what that output looks

481
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:48,930
like if I I'm okay okay so right here we

482
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:55,520
see I've got a watch command that is

483
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:58,740
gonna run an MB t get query to our demo

484
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,139
instance right now we can see these are

485
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,730
holding register address values honestly

486
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,590
from the outside and we have no idea

487
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,780
what these mean these could be

488
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,580
temperature settings these could be I I

489
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,040
don't know the wak'd of something right

490
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,600
these numbers look arbitrary but you

491
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,570
know believe me they're not there they

492
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,300
mean something to that particular device

493
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:20,760
and we're gonna go ahead and can I split

494
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:26,520
here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go

495
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:30,240
ahead and split this split it with that

496
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:34,530
and then I'm also gonna go right here do

497
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,270
the same so we're gonna have this kind

498
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,220
of on the side so we can go back to it

499
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,940
after we do the exploits so I can show

500
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,940
you what that looks like

501
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:51,330
alright so here's another MBT I get

502
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,940
watch that's gonna look at the coil so

503
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:57,870
just there is no one's right there isn't

504
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:00,030
one's that's the result of whatever

505
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,979
latter logic that you assigned to that

506
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:06,690
particular PLC for the functions that it

507
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:09,230
oversees it would be like me to just

508
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,210
lose where I was here we go okay so

509
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:15,580
we've all seen

510
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,020
what that output is there for watching

511
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,399
the holding register just values in the

512
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,900
coil so now we're going to get into

513
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:30,880
Modbus module and we're going to use

514
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:33,760
this mod framework nope yes there's some

515
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,490
bugs in here where it doesn't go right

516
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,460
back to the menu so you're gonna see me

517
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:43,779
control seeing a lot that's supposed to

518
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:48,299
say stuff doer because I use it to do

519
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:51,539
stuff so we're gonna we're gonna use

520
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,539
going on

521
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:37,929
mmm seems to have ran into something odd

522
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:54,460
give me just one second video is

523
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:58,179
probably a bit more go from there so I

524
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:01,950
do have the video just in case stuff

525
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:06,190
gets kind of schwifty which it has so

526
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:09,429
here we go the functional version of

527
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:12,340
what I was going to show you so rapid

528
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:16,120
fire getting in getting into stuff do or

529
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:18,939
see it shows up nicer there and what I

530
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,239
just did was I I pulled a show modules

531
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:25,240
which in smart smart is a Modbus testing

532
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,980
framework that I built a wrapper in

533
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,780
rapidfire for it wasn't originally a

534
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,730
part of rapid-fire rapid-fire was just

535
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,110
for holding register just values nothing

536
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,500
else and I just kind of kept building on

537
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:39,100
it so we're gonna do is we're going to

538
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,890
utilize the module Modbus scanner UID

539
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:45,820
this is hard to see than I thought I do

540
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:48,340
apologize if no one can see it but so we

541
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,649
what we just did was we set the set the

542
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,280
target host to zero we want to get the

543
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:57,400
UID of the PLC that way we can figure

544
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:04,060
out the functions so we see the UID is

545
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:08,250
one there's two just go with one now I'm

546
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:17,889
going to go ahead and use the show

547
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:22,570
functions or get function module and

548
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:24,610
then we set show the options we're gonna

549
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,230
set the our hosts again and then we're

550
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,300
gonna take the UID that we just got and

551
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:31,120
we're gonna put that in there as well

552
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,409
this is I mean if you work in Metasploit

553
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:42,459
or anything this framework looks

554
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:44,290
familiar and how to how to use it okay

555
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:48,190
it takes a second for these to come up

556
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:50,470
but so we see that function 3 is enabled

557
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,030
to read multiple holding registers and

558
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:55,020
I'm highlighting on the top right side

559
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:58,389
utilizing a terminal split watch window

560
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,639
we can see the different holding in

561
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,290
register address values there and then

562
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,780
function code read write multiple

563
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:10,510
registers that should foreshadow some

564
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:15,310
things I hope and give it a second and

565
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:17,500
stops eventually on stopping function

566
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,450
code one is supported which means that's

567
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,660
on which means we have the ability to

568
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:26,550
read from an external location the you

569
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:29,530
know bits in this coil and then a

570
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:32,169
function code 15 is being able to write

571
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:34,320
multiple coils some more foreshadowing

572
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,320
there

573
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,860
so then we're gonna get back into the

574
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,120
menthe bus module we're gonna use number

575
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,840
three which is a holding register

576
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,669
address value injection and send the

577
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,240
target IP address what we're doing here

578
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:57,510
is messing it up

579
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:03,480
I forgot it out no I didn't just cut

580
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:07,110
that out so we're doing the same thing

581
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:10,890
again putting in the you know home now

582
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:14,159
again we have the holding register sorry

583
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,840
the plc only handles serve money

584
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,940
communications at a time so that's why

585
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,189
we're sitting as starting and in address

586
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:24,660
I just put one through 21 because you

587
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:27,990
can see relatively okay the 1 through 20

588
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:34,170
on the top right and the value we're

589
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:38,210
gonna inject for test is 777 so pay

590
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:43,380
attention to the top right numbers and

591
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:45,900
so we have just quashed or ruined all

592
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:50,790
the configurations of that exposed PLC

593
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:52,050
so somebody's going to get fired we're

594
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:56,940
gonna do the same thing with oil

595
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:59,010
injection so it's the same same shebang

596
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:22,590
just with the bottom right I'm gonna get

597
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:23,940
in here real quick this video alright so

598
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:30,149
the next thing that we're gonna be doing

599
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:32,490
is if this turns on in time I'm probably

600
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,580
it's gonna migrate back to the thing so

601
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,870
I can explain and highlight things

602
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,659
actually no no no I I have it in here so

603
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:45,030
pretty much what we just did what we

604
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:47,670
just did here was we entered the MQTT

605
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,879
target and what happens is that broker

606
00:31:47,670 --> 00:32:02,220
that we target we're saying hey give me

607
00:31:50,880 --> 00:32:06,840
all your topics so these are all the

608
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:09,510
topics I'd like I showed you before why

609
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,060
don't I just go back so we have all

610
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:18,000
these topics here and we see one called

611
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:21,990
sensor sensors sensors - sent sense

612
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,550
sensor / sensor - 3 5 4 - and we see it

613
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:28,350
has the message of off I'm not sure we

614
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:35,909
can do with the app but um I guess we

615
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:42,469
can find out and highlight this three

616
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:46,170
more times and it is a little bit choppy

617
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:48,120
you end up having to re-enter the

618
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:51,120
mqtt target address again for that

619
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,909
broker and so the client that we want

620
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,149
sorry the sensor the topic that you want

621
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:59,790
to subscribe to is sensors sensors - 3 5

622
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:02,900
4 - the thing that we saw that was off

623
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:09,030
up here and now that we subscribe to it

624
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:11,760
we are choosing the published topic

625
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:14,550
which by default can be control unless

626
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,350
you change it and so now we've

627
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,418
subscribed to the target of the sensor

628
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,399
that has a binary on/off function we

629
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,810
don't wonder what that can be

630
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,410
then we've subscribed to the publishing

631
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,639
topic

632
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,020
which allows us to actually publish

633
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:30,810
things to it and we're gonna go ahead

634
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:33,000
and publish in something there we go on

635
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:37,470
so our little T's publishing the string

636
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:41,040
on to it and I have to go back into it

637
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:43,140
redo the querying and then give it a

638
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,670
second you can see right here

639
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:49,710
sensors slash sensor - 3 5 4 - it's a

640
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:53,990
very bottom the message is now on so

641
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:57,180
someone's like just turned 9 now it's

642
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,800
simple example but the fact of the

643
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,870
matter is that there are smart homes

644
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,110
with sensors that tell you if your doors

645
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:08,250
are opened or closed if I'm gonna break

646
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:11,668
into your home I don't know most people

647
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,260
do this but you could just see this out

648
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:18,600
in the open

649
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,950
change the option from closed to open so

650
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,659
if somebody's at work they think their

651
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:24,569
doors are closed but they're really open

652
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:38,339
but you're just giving the smart home

653
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:43,710
that message yeah so that's that next

654
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:44,250
step we're gonna I'm getting ahead of

655
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,610
myself

656
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:50,790
this is where we're gonna do the

657
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:54,060
automated tank gauges so the automated

658
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:55,830
tank gauge creating a fake one is sorry

659
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,130
creating a sample one is really

660
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:02,790
difficult so I went with a gas pot gasp

661
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:05,040
on tap high is really awesome as you can

662
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:09,930
build a functionality into it but um I

663
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:14,970
spent too much time with the meme so and

664
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:18,480
so what happens is when you enter the IP

665
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:21,089
address it will then I kind of have like

666
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,350
a little instruction thing in here

667
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:27,540
telling you what you can and can't do

668
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:29,759
it's basically printing out the the it's

669
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,400
the vendor Doc's really the controls of

670
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,240
the vendor Doc's of the automated tank

671
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,480
gauge vendor has online so you can see

672
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,799
here we start all commands utilizing a

673
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:46,020
break a and then open square bracket and

674
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,060
then any three numbers after that is a

675
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,320
command code and the zero zero I have no

676
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,529
idea it's just something that's got to

677
00:35:49,320 --> 00:36:00,119
be you know at the end of that so we're

678
00:35:52,530 --> 00:36:05,090
gonna go ahead and and we're gonna

679
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:07,860
eventually get into it there's a restart

680
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:12,330
a restart command that I end up just

681
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:15,440
showing so you can see here I ended up

682
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:18,690
messing that one up so you can see

683
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,520
there's a carrot a now I'm actually

684
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,980
missing the I they're supposed to be a I

685
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,250
right after it but you'll see that work

686
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:29,460
in a second here and then 201 is just

687
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:33,240
list inventory so 201 0 0 you're just

688
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:37,350
looking at the 201 so any other command

689
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,149
with the honeypot unfortunately does not

690
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:44,730
work it will just give that nine nine

691
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:47,190
nine nine foxfox one Bravo output but

692
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:54,480
yeah that's that's the that's the demo

693
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:59,460
I forgot how to work PowerPoint all

694
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,350
right so next the air-gap this is where

695
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,990
the you know we got to keep them

696
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:05,790
separated and the words of offspring was

697
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:09,629
actually a pioneer in the industrial

698
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:18,450
control system field now i'm that's not

699
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:23,820
true so pictorial gift representations

700
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:28,770
of the air-gap take a second so call

701
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:31,619
this and gap house pushing cutting

702
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:33,600
cables this dear I should have got one

703
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:37,290
of the dear falling but or whatever that

704
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:40,950
is gazelle or something but just to kind

705
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:45,460
of drive the point home of it forgive me

706
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:51,560
committing meme failure

707
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:54,350
so the typical traditional mindset of

708
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,140
the industrial control system admin is

709
00:37:54,350 --> 00:38:00,500
keep your ot keep your operational

710
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,390
technology off the interwebs don't do it

711
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:07,280
for any reason industrial relevance

712
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:10,580
don't don't do it but that's not

713
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,150
sustainable you dingus if you want to be

714
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,980
relevant you have to end up playing nice

715
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,650
with IT and that's what it comes down to

716
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,680
with cyber physical security is learning

717
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:23,960
how to integrate securely so you can't

718
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,509
just sequester yourself off into a cubby

719
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:33,830
hole because any gets stagnant and

720
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:35,990
you're not able to grow so how do we

721
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:38,390
securely bridge the air gap what I'm

722
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:41,149
gonna be getting into here is something

723
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:44,150
that I have presented before at another

724
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:46,040
conference it's regarding secure

725
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,860
architecture in an industrial control

726
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,020
system or ot environment but the idea

727
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:54,770
being that what you see here can

728
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:56,630
actually be kind of you know re molded

729
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,100
or customized for another so like this

730
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,740
industrial control system you might be

731
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:03,560
able to come up with a way to adapt and

732
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:05,479
pivot this to an IOT setup or something

733
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,100
like that right so that's the idea so I

734
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:14,990
don't want anyone to think I'm just

735
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:21,740
being a one you know view here so it's

736
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:24,919
getting to some fun de mentals we have

737
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:27,229
cyber security rule number one you're

738
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,020
not secure no matter what you've got to

739
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,360
always keep that mindset and here we

740
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:36,200
have a guy poking needle holes into a

741
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:41,090
water bottle it just seemed right to use

742
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,220
at the time and here we have Rocco Bodhi

743
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:46,580
of mega64

744
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:53,029
hacking everything invest buy stock went

745
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:54,620
down next day so and just to really

746
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,750
drive the point home that you need to

747
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:59,169
keep this in your mind that whatever

748
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,519
you're doing always come from the the

749
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:02,598
area the mindset that you're not secure

750
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,928
and that's something I don't have to

751
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:08,749
tell you guys but I do have this very

752
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:11,719
slow moving growing text that will give

753
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:26,029
you time to reflect so this is my drink

754
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:29,439
break alright that's that's enough it

755
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:36,469
gets rather big takes up yeah oh yeah

756
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:40,160
so here is the sliding scale of security

757
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:43,449
this is used in the sands industrial

758
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:47,359
control system in ot's security course

759
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:48,650
starting from securing the architecture

760
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,538
and then getting in the path of defense

761
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,999
and from there you've all probably seen

762
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:54,890
this but I'm more just kind of context

763
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:57,799
building so that those of you who might

764
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:59,569
not understand ICS security can

765
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:02,989
hopefully look at this and realize that

766
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:05,299
there's um kind of draw some relevance

767
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:07,159
to the following slides because I didn't

768
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:08,719
want to lose anybody so I feel that was

769
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:11,929
a good thing to do so how do we properly

770
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:14,569
secure the air-gap I you have here

771
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:16,400
compulsory methods employing proper

772
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:20,119
encryption to cyber-physical network

773
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,789
setup so obviously the IOT MQTT broker

774
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,679
mosquito that we got into proper

775
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:28,150
encryption wasn't set up our triple-a

776
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:30,140
was in the toilet then occasionally

777
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,130
nothing was done with that or else we

778
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,538
wouldn't be able to get into it

779
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,229
notionally and speaking obviously it's

780
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:39,439
just a lab on my laptop but routine

781
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:41,328
vulnerability checks being able to check

782
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:45,319
for vulnerabilities on a pretty quick

783
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:47,169
iteration iterative basis and performing

784
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:50,150
vulnerability management from there and

785
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:55,069
deploying active monitoring so a sim a

786
00:41:50,150 --> 00:42:01,999
sock some way of being alerted a lot of

787
00:41:55,069 --> 00:42:04,909
the a lot of the industry regulations do

788
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:07,089
require regulations and compliances have

789
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:09,529
some tenant in there that requires a

790
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:11,029
monitoring of logs and activity right

791
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:12,520
it's just it's kind of like how HIPAA

792
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:15,940
has a PCI has it

793
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:23,080
has it Nick also has it not Nick Nurik

794
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:28,119
sorry so continued how do we you secure

795
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:30,279
the network architecture so through

796
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,640
architecture as a bit redundant I could

797
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:38,830
have gotten rid of that subtext there

798
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:42,450
and so a quick time check I'm going to

799
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:44,980
be going through these pretty quickly

800
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:47,410
for this example this green box right

801
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,020
here is going to represent a SCADA

802
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:52,450
device which is a supervisory control

803
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:55,390
and data acquisition device that's in

804
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:58,509
charge of monitoring manager in managing

805
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:01,980
different PLC's and this cloud logo

806
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:07,750
right here is going to be the remote

807
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:10,090
magical analytics thing right so this is

808
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:12,130
how a simple architecture can look

809
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,630
you've got your you've got your control

810
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,060
points and monitor points you've got

811
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,760
your PLC's which hold domain over that

812
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,650
and you have your SCADA or NTU which

813
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,290
will hold domain over those PLC's so you

814
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:24,760
can obviously pick up there's a certain

815
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:28,420
semblance of hierarchy here and

816
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,070
cyber-physical and IC sot networks so we

817
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:32,020
do a little bit of threat modeling at a

818
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:34,890
very simple easy level so what are we

819
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:37,000
building architecture I just showed you

820
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,560
what can go wrong

821
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,760
just assume that everything's going to

822
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,400
go wrong when you're doing your threat

823
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,830
modeling so incoming communications of

824
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,200
any kind can compromise a SCADA or PLC

825
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:50,380
that's exposed only because they are so

826
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,118
rigid in the ways that they are built

827
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:57,340
that if you give anything it's not

828
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:59,920
inspect expecting it's not good and so

829
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:04,210
here we have this this blue dashed line

830
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,580
representing the area of trust here so

831
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:09,609
going out we can trust that but coming

832
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,840
in we can't so what are we going to do

833
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:12,700
about it we want to protect the SCADA

834
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:17,020
Network from an unsolicited incoming

835
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:18,160
traffic and how we do that is yeah don't

836
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:20,730
do this don't just connect your device

837
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:25,450
to the Internet I forgot about that

838
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:26,240
don't do that so here we go we the

839
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,220
purple dash

840
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,799
now represent the trust barrier in this

841
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:33,560
particular diagram we see here the

842
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,770
addition of a bright blue almost cyan

843
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,840
box what this is it's a dative diode or

844
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:41,000
a unidirectional gateway only a few

845
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,190
companies actually make these the idea

846
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,330
is that you have a one-way outgoing data

847
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:52,340
diode that lets traffic go out but you

848
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:54,319
can't come in so did we do a good job

849
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,750
enough so test do we do a good enough

850
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,190
job I became English right now so test

851
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,790
it right so try and get somebody on the

852
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:06,770
outside to just send crap to it

853
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:08,870
arbitrary or valid traffic so now I'm

854
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,880
gonna get into these are the perspective

855
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:13,069
proposed solutions which again will not

856
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,350
work in every environment but the idea

857
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:19,520
is to think securely so I'm gonna give

858
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:21,049
you my ideas so here we have SCADA cloud

859
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,100
analytics which is sitting in the cloud

860
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:27,050
somewhere we've got our switch right

861
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,660
here with our two different networks so

862
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:31,580
we have we have a specific segment to

863
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:35,089
network just for the OT then the int

864
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:37,640
come you know component of the

865
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:39,560
organization and a simple way of looking

866
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,390
at it is if you really want to do that

867
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,100
without having traffic come in these are

868
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,420
examples without using a unidirectional

869
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,130
gateway by the way because the

870
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,770
indirection gateways are really

871
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,680
expensive and it's also not a perfect

872
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:54,800
solution because you can also there are

873
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:57,500
reasons that you have to do updates to

874
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,700
whatever's on the OT network or you have

875
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,530
some money in the outside that has to do

876
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:04,100
some kind of maintenance right so you

877
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:07,910
there's an configurational something

878
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:10,520
that you can actually allow it to accept

879
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,660
traffic at certain times right but the

880
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,990
idea is it's always supposed to be off

881
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:17,210
so so what we do is we have a relay

882
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:20,779
server from the OT network to the IT

883
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:22,910
Network then we have another another

884
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,920
high level model here we have a relay

885
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:27,020
server with a one-way VPN connection

886
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,970
from the OT network to independently

887
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,759
segment to network that is also separate

888
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:33,259
from the int component and then that

889
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,760
goes out and now we're gonna get to the

890
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,980
granules of it how are we doing this

891
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,800
we're sending the one-way VPN connection

892
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,390
over a network trunk

893
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,330
Network trunk for those who don't know

894
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:45,279
is basically a configuration on the

895
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:47,799
switch or network device basically

896
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,450
saying that hey this IP from this subnet

897
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,950
can talk to this IP from the southern

898
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:56,859
subnet but nothing else so this is kind

899
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:59,710
of like the I got a little bit happy

900
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:01,840
with this here but we're going with that

901
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:04,740
with that second high level network we

902
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,119
have the OT network we have the

903
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,700
segmented network right here then we

904
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:14,260
have the IT network and so we have here

905
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:17,109
is so let's say that this this whole set

906
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:19,690
up right here is just kind of hanging to

907
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:21,340
the left of this relay server right so

908
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:23,110
we have the three different subnets for

909
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:28,750
the three different networks we have 192

910
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:31,900
168 3 0 - 2 4 then we have 92168 dot 4

911
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:34,270
dot 0 when I took a 168.50 so let's say

912
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,630
this is the arbitrary I just picked IP

913
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:39,250
addresses we have 192 168 3.90 is relay

914
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,020
server on the OT network constru

915
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:45,820
utilizing a network trying to pass the

916
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:48,220
one-way VPN server connection from the

917
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,840
this is for monitoring and analytics by

918
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:53,109
the way sending out to the cloud we're

919
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,850
setting it to a recipient a relay server

920
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:56,920
which will then send it through a

921
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:59,049
reverse proxy to go out to the Internet

922
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,369
the idea behind the reverse proxy is

923
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:04,600
that once you put something on the

924
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:06,310
Internet it can be seen ideally and so

925
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,170
if something tries to hit that we can

926
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:10,440
have AI basically

927
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,970
reroute to a honeypot would be the idea

928
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,570
I haven't tried it myself but

929
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:19,509
theoretically I find this to be a

930
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:23,920
functional thing and then the honeypot

931
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:25,480
will also so we have this need server

932
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,950
right here which is probably just

933
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,770
running to ricotta or something and then

934
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:31,629
we can also forward honeypot logs to

935
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:33,369
find out what's going on that we were

936
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,380
feeding all this intelligence into this

937
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,640
and we could realize that hey these

938
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:41,830
people trying to get into our device

939
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:45,879
right so we have the tap-tap span poor

940
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:46,990
right here this pink one and that's

941
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,500
feeding all the network traffic and

942
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:52,569
while also simultaneously ingesting logs

943
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,729
from the honeypot server

944
00:48:52,569 --> 00:48:58,509
and we're utilizing syslog-ng is a

945
00:48:54,729 --> 00:49:04,509
forward around this this right here

946
00:48:58,509 --> 00:49:06,609
which is the outgoing port yeah so not a

947
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:08,919
perfect model but if you want to get an

948
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:22,779
idea of just some creative ways to do it

949
00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:25,499
I think this suits well okay so we're

950
00:49:22,779 --> 00:49:28,689
gonna go ahead and go through a quick

951
00:49:25,499 --> 00:49:32,109
scenario where we have an industrial

952
00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:35,140
control system set up we have this is

953
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:37,598
our SCADA communication so the this is

954
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,419
the traffic going from the PLC and to

955
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,679
the skated device itself we have no

956
00:49:40,419 --> 00:49:42,999
visibility from here to the

957
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,199
interactional gateway we have no

958
00:49:42,999 --> 00:49:46,448
visibility from the interactional

959
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:48,910
gateway to any other layers if you have

960
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:51,130
any and then we have a monitoring

961
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,319
platform right here so really high

962
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:54,999
vendors will say hey you come onto her

963
00:49:53,319 --> 00:49:58,779
skate events use this plug this up

964
00:49:54,999 --> 00:50:00,428
whatever we have an employee's he's kind

965
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:02,049
of a disgruntled employee right like

966
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:05,019
he's been asking for a raise for like a

967
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:07,569
year now and he keeps saying no Texas

968
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:10,299
too much checks personal emails takes

969
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:12,308
phone calls so he kind of gets ticked

970
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:13,869
off and becomes criminal and so what he

971
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,059
does he has direct physical access to

972
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:19,559
the SCADA device and he goes to he plugs

973
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:22,509
in a thumb drive and flips it around

974
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:27,669
basically turning into something that it

975
00:50:22,509 --> 00:50:31,390
shouldn't be right in this case it talks

976
00:50:27,669 --> 00:50:34,538
to a remote server which then installed

977
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:35,679
so notionally for this the the attacker

978
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:37,529
has also done something to the

979
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:42,159
unidirectional gateway that allows it to

980
00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:44,499
then a accept incoming traffic so the

981
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:49,529
remote server can do something to that

982
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:52,238
desk a device and now this guy has a

983
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:53,650
Bitcoin miner right so we had this

984
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,169
powerful scare device that just sitting

985
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:57,039
there mining Bitcoin for him it's just

986
00:50:56,169 --> 00:51:01,000
one example

987
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:04,080
it's contrived but

988
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,730
so try and get visibility in those areas

989
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:11,020
we're reaching towards the end of this

990
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:13,420
so the monitoring so we've all seen this

991
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:17,440
hackers movie is real cool all that

992
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:21,400
