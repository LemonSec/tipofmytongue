00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,160
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:07,439
No so did you accept my talk because of

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,000
the donation and the GoFundMe is that

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:18,119
how I got in you did not buy your talk

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,230
okay let's get my own slide all right so

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,550
you've been reading the title for a

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,410
little while now the right way to do

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,410
wrong physical security secrets of

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,960
criminals and professionals alike so the

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,869
title of this talk is actually based on

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,180
a book that Harry Houdini wrote in 1906

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,820
the right way to be wrong and in it he

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,860
divulged many the secrets of successful

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,850
criminals - at that time the largely

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,800
unaware public these were the fraud

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,750
schemes and pickpocketing and things

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,360
like that that criminals would run on

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,190
the street so I took my inspiration from

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,620
this and what I'm going to show you

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,349
today is a bunch of physical security

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:00,149
secrets used by criminals and pen

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:03,260
testers alike so people make assumptions

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,880
about how different schemes work and

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,420
believe them to be very complicated but

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,830
in many cases schemes are very simple

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,909
and straightforward and it's just a

27
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,590
matter of knowing what the secret is

28
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:20,640
most people will assume that during a

29
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,650
physical security test that besides

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,150
tailgating and social engineering the

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,430
other way you might get in some place is

32
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,380
to actually pick a lock that couldn't be

33
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,299
further from the truth the number of

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,710
times that I have actually had to pick a

35
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:37,530
lock on an engagement are very small so

36
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,860
we also have to understand that some

37
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,619
physical controls have very easily known

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,659
and executed bypasses and quite frankly

39
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,270
people screw up so you have locksmiths

40
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,939
that put things in incorrectly and as

41
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,240
long as you know what the common

42
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,429
mistakes are you can you know kind of

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,280
exploit those so what I'm going to show

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,869
you today are some of the ways that

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,049
locks and access control systems can be

46
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,729
bypassed without picking I will say

47
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,069
right now I have a ton of links in

48
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,500
videos and everything in my talk don't

49
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,720
feel like you have to take pictures or

50
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,620
have me slow down it's all going to be

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,209
posted on get

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,890
and I will publish the link to that on

53
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:21,360
my Twitter feed you're welcome so some

54
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,089
of the stuff I'm not going to talk about

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,580
today that are definitely things that

56
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,000
you want in your your pen test bag these

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,380
are all electronic things so and I'm not

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,019
going over this just for the sake of

59
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,079
time and each one of these topics you

60
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:40,050
can have a whole other talk on and if

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,569
you think about the relationship to like

62
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,600
applications security these are more

63
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,250
kind of advanced attacks how about you

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,590
make sure that your basic patching is

65
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,510
done right first like actually have a

66
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,880
secure lock and make sure that it's

67
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,060
installed correctly before you deal with

68
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,400
this higher level threat stuff so I'm

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,349
only going to cover physical methods

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,090
there's no about me I had an

71
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,440
introduction you can Oh sent me online

72
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,310
if you want starting at Twitter and

73
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:13,099
LinkedIn and I will also nod to my

74
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:15,390
imposter syndrome I may not be the most

75
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,760
qualified person in the room there are

76
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,350
probably some super elite red teamers or

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,840
something like that in here who may know

78
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,549
more than me I love to talk physical

79
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
security so if you you see something

80
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:29,700
that you feel I left out or I got

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:33,410
incorrect let's talk and special thanks

82
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,390
to some people I like deviant max power

83
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,310
Howard Payne who contributed to this

84
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,130
talk and actually reviewed the talk with

85
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,440
me to make sure it was complete and

86
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,900
YouTube videos from lock-picking lawyer

87
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,760
Bosnian bill in night owl pretty much

88
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,100
everything that that I've learned that I

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,590
employ on my physical pen tests are from

90
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,090
this group of people and my imposter

91
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,280
syndrome just got a little bit better

92
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,190
before this talk because I'd literally

93
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,319
just put deviant in a lift so he's not

94
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,530
here to be in the back scratching his

95
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,179
chin alright

96
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,650
so consider yourself warned and it's

97
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,750
good this is the end of the conference

98
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,459
so there's not as much opportunity for

99
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,620
you to get in trouble yes you're

100
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,720
authorized access to your workplace or

101
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,579
hotel whatever but you are not

102
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,310
authorized to test their physical

103
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,560
security controls it is entirely

104
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,419
possible to break something while you're

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,030
using some of the tools that I'll show

106
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,139
you so don't be that person

107
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,479
and just because something is

108
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,080
non-destructive and easy doesn't mean

109
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,870
that the local laws don't apply and I'm

110
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,479
going to warn you right now you will be

111
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,940
scarred by this talk you're going to see

112
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,919
things that are suddenly going to like

113
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,620
open your eyes and you're gonna see this

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,000
like truly epic security fail stuff all

115
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,080
over the place many of what I'm many of

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,790
the things I'm going to show you our

117
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,030
locks that are sold in the big-box

118
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,860
stores so I won't mention any names but

119
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,099
I basically don't buy any locks at the

120
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,210
big-box stores this is going to be super

121
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,620
fast so fasten your seatbelt hold on

122
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,239
alright so I'm gonna break things down

123
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,850
padlocks doors

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,520
key boxes common key systems but let's

125
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,840
starting with padlocks I typically see

126
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,979
these things on document recycle bins

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,409
filing cabinets with an external

128
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:25,080
security bar gates of facilities things

129
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,210
like that and if you watch YouTube

130
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,950
videos from lock making lawyer Bosnian

131
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,750
bill some of the things I'm going to

132
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,030
show you now are what they will do first

133
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,740
before trying to actually pick a lock

134
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:39,630
let's look for the known common bypasses

135
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,340
so padlock shims most of you are

136
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,919
probably familiar with the concept of

137
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,979
xem it's just a thin piece of metal that

138
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,169
is inserted between the shackle and the

139
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,630
lock body and it's used to push the

140
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:54,359
locking lever away so the shim that you

141
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,560
might have made in the in the lockpick

142
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,890
village today or at a previous

143
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,640
conference would be made from aluminum

144
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:04,380
can they do sell these commercially I

145
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,300
don't particularly care for them for

146
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,969
padlocks they can be a little bit

147
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,010
thicker than the the soda-can thing but

148
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,669
the upside is they're reusable you can

149
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,840
you can use them multiple times

150
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:19,469
most people have learned this attack of

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,229
course with a master combo lock what

152
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,240
some people don't realize is that it

153
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,680
also works on padlocks that have poor

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,330
tolerances so if there's a gap in

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,140
between the shackle and the lock body

156
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:34,349
the difference is these have two locking

157
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:40,539
levers so you need to put the the shim

158
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:43,099
on both sides so this is a Chinese lock

159
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:45,289
and you'll see I put the shim in on one

160
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:47,688
side give it it you put it in on the

161
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:52,818
outside and twist it inward so it pushes

162
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:58,939
the locking lever away and then put the

163
00:06:52,819 --> 00:07:01,060
second one in twist it and voila easy as

164
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:03,889
that

165
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,039
all right then the next one this blows

166
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:10,129
people's minds this is a lever bypass so

167
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,620
some low-end padlocks use just a single

168
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,939
locking lever so it's it's up here at

169
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,310
the top of the lock and that's what

170
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:18,529
presses into the shackle to keep it from

171
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,770
being pulled out and you see down here

172
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:24,409
this lever is at the very back of the

173
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,080
lock but the lock core of course is

174
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:29,300
taken out in this image if the back of

175
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,300
the lock core is open you can actually

176
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,889
reach a piece of metal through past all

177
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:39,680
the pins and just trip the latch

178
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:42,349
directly so this is a demo of that this

179
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,719
tool is actually from sparrows and it's

180
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:49,878
called the shank so in the case of

181
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:51,740
master since there are two different

182
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,650
locking levers they have this thing

183
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,659
called the master switch so you can see

184
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,580
there's two pointy parts one goes in and

185
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,990
hits one latch the other goes in and

186
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,508
hits the other latch you rock it back

187
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,419
and forth and it'll it'll collapse both

188
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,919
but honestly I don't I don't have this

189
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:09,080
in my tool bag I don't use it because

190
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,448
it's typically easier just to rake a

191
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:17,080
master lock open so it's not really

192
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:20,060
needed okay then the next thing is

193
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,000
warded picks and bypass keys so the

194
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,610
warded lock you may recognize this

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,020
little zigzaggy keyway and that's one of

196
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,550
the ways that you'll recognize a warded

197
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,779
lock they also might be just completely

198
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,039
open like a loops a little rectangular

199
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,870
opening and you can tell it's a word

200
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,838
lock because obviously you won't see any

201
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:44,120
pins and you won't see any wafers inside

202
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,730
of them the the the way that this

203
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,949
actually works is when we say warded

204
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,339
there's actually pieces of metal that

205
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:53,180
are on both sides of the lock and they

206
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,730
fit into

207
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,099
the notches of the key and when you turn

208
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,620
the key there is a single lever

209
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,080
typically inside of there that will

210
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,170
release the shackle that lever is

211
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,140
typically way at the top so this is what

212
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,699
the lever looks like on the inside and

213
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,740
so typically that's only the end of the

214
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,410
key that is actually tripping that lever

215
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,740
so if you were to take all this

216
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,069
extraneous material off maybe you

217
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,649
wouldn't really need a key

218
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:26,300
so Houdini had his own set I have felt I

219
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,740
had to throw that in because warded

220
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,959
locks were really popular in his time

221
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,200
but this is what we have now made out of

222
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:36,920
a spring steel and available for like

223
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,810
ten bucks and here's how ridiculously

224
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,209
easy it is to open these locks so

225
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:46,670
there's my key and basically you just

226
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,319
run through these one by one until you

227
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:55,630
find one that fits in the key way and

228
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,630
can't rip the let the latch scary right

229
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:04,069
okay the next one is actuator bypass and

230
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:09,650
and this is a vulnerability that we find

231
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:12,500
on the American 700 and 1100 series the

232
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,750
abus 72 and there's actually a ton of

233
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,610
other manufacturers a lot of stuff

234
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,680
you'll see from China and it's like

235
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,420
you'll hold the American lock next to

236
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,310
this no-name brand you've never heard of

237
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,250
where they've literally just copied the

238
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,810
American design so if you see a lock

239
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,029
body that looks very similar to an

240
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:33,680
American this might work there as well

241
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:36,680
so basically what this is is you take

242
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,810
this long thin tool and similar to that

243
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,790
that lever bypass you go past all the

244
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:47,329
pins and there's a little gap in between

245
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:49,399
the back of the lock here so this is the

246
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:52,250
actual the actuator that you're trying

247
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,620
to turn a turn and this is this piece

248
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,620
here is the back of the lock so when it

249
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,930
when the key is inserted this part turns

250
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,970
and it presses up on this turns it

251
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,579
clockwise and then that releases the

252
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,410
shackle so what we do if the bypass tool

253
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:09,560
is go through the lock

254
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,899
out this opening and jam it right in

255
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,829
between this piece and the actuator and

256
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:17,779
just turn it so in an effort to try to

257
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:20,420
fix this vulnerability when it came out

258
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:23,420
American got crafty and said well we're

259
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:26,810
gonna put a security wafer in the back

260
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,060
so nobody can but they're trying to

261
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,768
retrofit in existing lock so there's not

262
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,829
a whole lot of room to work work in

263
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:36,470
there this this wafer is extremely thin

264
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:39,439
so Peterson was nice enough to come out

265
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,240
with a wafer breaker so basically you

266
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:42,920
just put it in like the key and go BAM

267
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,360
on the hammer now there's a hole and you

268
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:52,069
can reach right through it so I should

269
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:55,009
note that the American 1100 in Abe is 72

270
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:58,099
are technically lockout tagout locks

271
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:59,870
which is essentially lock you put on

272
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,490
machinery when you need to operate it

273
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,410
and you don't want to get killed so

274
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,220
their original intent was not

275
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,689
necessarily security it was safety and

276
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,040
consumers don't necessarily understand

277
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:13,009
that so they're getting this lock that

278
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:16,069
looks tough but isn't necessarily you

279
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:19,550
know for that that into that use so

280
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:22,339
here's actually a demo on this cheap

281
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:26,389
master knock ah or sorry American knock

282
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:31,339
off just just as easy as using a key

283
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:34,130
right all right the next next piece is

284
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:37,069
comb picks or over lifting you'll see

285
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,410
this on padlocks you'll notice the

286
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:41,990
padlock body is really wide but then the

287
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,980
core is really small that's typically

288
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:50,059
one sign that that this lock could be

289
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:51,589
over lifted and like the master 140 is

290
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:54,500
an example of one that this is very

291
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:57,380
effective on basically what what is

292
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,360
going on is the pin chambers where you

293
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,569
fit the spring the driver pin and the

294
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,120
key pin are too long so there's enough

295
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:06,889
space up here and you can insert this

296
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,959
comb pick and push everything up

297
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,660
completely out of the core and there's

298
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:15,079
nothing stopping the lock from turning

299
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:17,660
so the tool we use is a comb Peck it's

300
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:19,670
available multiple form factors typic

301
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,770
the you'll see them four four and five

302
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:33,469
pin locks mostly for you know four

303
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:35,390
padlocks and this is the master 140 so

304
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,760
yeah this is they might go back I have

305
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,880
just a really small thing of all these

306
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,930
these little tools

307
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,700
alright the next the next one is a

308
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,930
sesame lock I'm sure everybody's seen

309
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,280
these it's common design that has ended

310
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,260
up getting copied by multiple

311
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,569
manufacturers so if you see one that

312
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,569
looks like this there's a really good

313
00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:00,320
chance that it's also vulnerable the

314
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,180
master 175 is the most common or

315
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,550
commonly seen and you'll see them on

316
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,310
construction sites any kind of Public

317
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,550
Works because it's easier to distribute

318
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,109
a combination and change the code

319
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,990
occasionally than it is to hand out you

320
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,730
know 50 keys the problem with this lock

321
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:20,030
of course because it's in my talk

322
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,530
there's a well known bypass the most

323
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,720
comprehensive breakdown of this

324
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:26,150
vulnerability was done by my buddy max

325
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,970
power so you can grab the youtube link

326
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:32,630
later this is actually from the hope

327
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,160
conference in 2018 and he takes you

328
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,910
through this and a lot of other stuff

329
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,750
but essentially the way this works is

330
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:44,980
this this piece here these little

331
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,380
fingers actually ride on fly wheels on

332
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:52,250
the side of the combo dials and this

333
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,870
this Tang is in the middle of the two

334
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,420
locking calls so it's keeping the pawls

335
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,640
pushed into the shackle and if you can

336
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,979
get some thin piece of metal inside the

337
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,080
lock and push on those fingers or

338
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:08,240
manipulate this plate you can literally

339
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,890
pull the Tang right out of the spot

340
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,870
between the two locking poles and in

341
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,240
this picture I got from Max he's

342
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,510
actually painted it pink so you can see

343
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,280
where it is and I had to circle this in

344
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,830
yellow because it's nearly impossible to

345
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,280
see this orange handled knife

346
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,510
essentially and that that's where the

347
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,250
thin piece of metal from the knife is so

348
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:33,130
he's actually lifting the Tang up and

349
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,130
out of the middle of those actuators

350
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:41,179
our a so decoding combo locks

351
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:43,610
combination locks rely on wheels that

352
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:46,279
the user turns you know to dial in the

353
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,319
right combo essentially there's a little

354
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,860
notch and every single one of these

355
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:54,019
wheels and your your object is to try to

356
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,720
find where all those notches line up and

357
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:59,600
then rotate all of the wheels forward

358
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,309
one at a time and typically you can

359
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,529
create some binding tension just by

360
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:05,540
pulling in the lock really hard and then

361
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,269
as you turn it's possible to find where

362
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,129
these gates are in this case I'm not

363
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:16,699
showing a padlock this is actually a

364
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:20,600
like bicycle style like cable lock and

365
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:22,990
let's run the run the tape here this one

366
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,999
is an extreme example and watch the gap

367
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:28,970
in between here in the the dial to see

368
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:33,499
how it moved over that's how crappy the

369
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:35,329
tolerances are on this so doing this

370
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:38,480
video this ends up going around passed

371
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,069
the number but you can see where the

372
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:47,869
individual wheels are actually moving

373
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:49,399
back and forth a little bit and

374
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:52,540
essentially I'm just putting really

375
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:59,329
really hard tension pulling on each side

376
00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:11,119
look at that gap and it slides all the

377
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:12,470
way over right yeah I know I was trying

378
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,719
to figure out how to make this go like

379
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,140
fast like faster motion and I just could

380
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,140
figure it out

381
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:39,389
and and not quite lined up BAM Wayne as

382
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:43,390
if as if I would put that on anything

383
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,070
okay so jiggler or tryout keys these

384
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,690
sold out in the village really fast I

385
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,790
was surprised at at how many people were

386
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,060
interested in them these are pretty

387
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,950
useful against wafer locks so wafer lock

388
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,040
as the name implies and this is this is

389
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:00,100
a really cheap wafer lock are

390
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,430
essentially comprised of multiple brass

391
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,260
wafer wafers in the Tang on the top of

392
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,260
the wafer is actually sticking up out of

393
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,850
the lock in keeping it from turning

394
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,010
wafers are normally pushed all in one

395
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,590
direction so they they're stopping that

396
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:17,260
lock from turning by a spring that is

397
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:20,230
underneath that that little nub on the

398
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,810
on the wafer and when we put the key in

399
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,700
it raises it lowers the wafers so that

400
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,370
they get out of their own way and allows

401
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,560
the lock to turn these are really common

402
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:33,129
for desk locks

403
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:35,310
you know cabinets storage like key

404
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,030
storage boxes and things like that

405
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:39,250
unfortunately what some people don't

406
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:42,940
realize is this kind of lock is super

407
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,830
popular on electronic safes so you've

408
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,920
got your little keypad but you'll

409
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:50,470
typically see a manufacturer plate or

410
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,390
something with their their brand name if

411
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,040
you take the screws out of that or you

412
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,410
pop that piece of plastic out there's

413
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,899
typically a wafer lock behind that so

414
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,810
you don't need to know the the password

415
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,870
or whatever the combo is you just need a

416
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,940
stupid backup key it's essentially what

417
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,100
we what we do here with the jiggler or

418
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,350
tryout key these are just like like a

419
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,409
lock pick rake it's just lots of bumps

420
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,540
and you put some turning tension on it

421
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,340
just like you would for key and move it

422
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,530
in and out really quickly and it is

423
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,240
essentially like a raking attack against

424
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,639
the the wafers it bounces them up and

425
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,360
down they drop into the right combo and

426
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,320
it opens right up so unfortunately this

427
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,320
is how bad they are

428
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:44,779
so there's my little jiggler set and it

429
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:50,720
works just like a key well it went in

430
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:52,490
once in all right so doors of course are

431
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,220
gonna be the most common thing that I

432
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,720
will run into on on assessments and so

433
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,549
this section really covers all the

434
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,059
common ways to get in

435
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:04,279
door latch bypass or Lloyd tools and

436
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,120
we've quite a few of us have broken in

437
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,830
our own house

438
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,908
right using the credit card trick or

439
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:15,350
maybe somebody else's and technically

440
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:17,809
that trick should really not work it's

441
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:20,809
the principle here is that you either

442
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:23,870
push in on your pushing on the curved

443
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:26,330
part of the latch to either push in or

444
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:31,399
reach behind it depending on how the the

445
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:33,980
latch is oriented and here's why that

446
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:37,639
attack shouldn't work so any exterior

447
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,710
door you should have a dead latch on and

448
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:42,258
the dead latch is this other little

449
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,120
piece so you you know the main latch and

450
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:46,669
then this little rounded piece that also

451
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,709
goes in and out the problem is that when

452
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:53,120
many homeowners install these types of

453
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:56,000
locks they will look at the size of the

454
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,389
strike plate and the size of the latch

455
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,279
and all of this stuff fits in the hole

456
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:03,168
so people will install it such that it

457
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,139
all goes in the hole that's incorrect

458
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:07,909
what is supposed to happen is the dead

459
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:10,789
latch is supposed to be making contact

460
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:13,100
with the strike plate when the dead

461
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:16,129
latch is pushed in the latch is locked

462
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,080
out in place and you need to insert the

463
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:20,269
key and unlock it to release the dead

464
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,549
latch and therefore also manipulate the

465
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:24,860
latch so go home and check out your

466
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:26,870
doors and I bet you some of you are

467
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:32,350
gonna have this this dead latch in the

468
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:34,729
hole so we also see this in commercial

469
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,899
setups as well the dead latch looks a

470
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,059
little different it's not the little

471
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:40,399
round thing but it is a separate little

472
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:42,139
bar there and this is what happens when

473
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:44,320
you don't insure that it's installed

474
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:44,320
correctly

475
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:54,170
and guess what that's the network closet

476
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:58,370
so now I can put my little pen test

477
00:21:54,170 --> 00:22:01,940
Dropbox in and get in whenever I want we

478
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,830
we do see that sometimes you can't even

479
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,990
see the latch but there's another way

480
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,449
you can get around this to just a thin

481
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,760
piece of plastic well if you shove it in

482
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:15,920
we'll go around basically the corner of

483
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:17,929
the door and trip the latch and this

484
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,850
happens to be on a in a small server

485
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:21,850
room tada

486
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:28,428
now what some people will do to try to

487
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,520
fix that problem instead of you know

488
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:33,470
actually correcting the latch is just

489
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,830
put this big metal plate on it I'm sure

490
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:39,679
everybody has seen this right the

491
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,419
problem is it's you know it's a lazy

492
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,110
patch because it can still be bypassed

493
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:47,390
so essentially you just need a piece of

494
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:50,659
piano wire or I don't know a couple

495
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:53,660
strands a cat5 wire from you know from

496
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,550
mined out of it you just rock it back

497
00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:02,210
and forth and it's basically behind the

498
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:04,280
latch and it just rips it the most

499
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,850
common way that I've been getting in

500
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,470
places is actually exploiting the lever

501
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,240
style handles that are mandated

502
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,990
according to the Americans with

503
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,120
Disabilities Act so these were part of

504
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,559
commercial code now because frankly some

505
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,169
people don't have hands they don't have

506
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,460
fingers it's easy to just whack it with

507
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:28,309
a nub you know whatever you've got it

508
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,110
also mandates low profile thresholds so

509
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:32,899
wheelchair can get over it that leaves

510
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:36,169
people vulnerable to an underdog civil

511
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:39,110
attack so this is essentially just a big

512
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:41,750
piece of kind of thick wire that that

513
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:44,030
has some some structure to it and then

514
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,980
another thin piece of wire attached to

515
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,290
the top so what we do is we stick it

516
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,450
underneath the door and we rock it back

517
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,879
until we hear the tool hit the back of

518
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,220
the door slide it across and actually

519
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,400
hook on to the lever handle and pull it

520
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,559
down so on the left this is the

521
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,900
inside view and you can kind of see it

522
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,850
moving around there and this is the

523
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:13,789
outside view pull down right there

524
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:15,320
and a min in this case this was just an

525
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:17,570
entrance to an office suite that had a

526
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:24,850
combo lock on the outside and this one

527
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:24,850
was actually a carted carted door what

528
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:30,950
crash bars and exit paddles so some

529
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,100
doors will have a lock on the outside

530
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,080
but on the inside you need to have some

531
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,389
sort of a panic exit device because if

532
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,250
there's a fire there's a you know

533
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,260
shooting something like that people need

534
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,929
to get out of the building fast so

535
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,629
they'll put crash bars this is a lever

536
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:50,990
that releases the dead latch that's the

537
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:54,500
paddle and if there's any kind of gap in

538
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:56,149
between the doors here you can get in

539
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,090
because there's a tool called a crash

540
00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:01,610
bar bypass essentially you stick it in

541
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,860
between the door rotate it and then when

542
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:07,189
you pull it out it'll actually press the

543
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:10,039
the paddle press the the crash bar or

544
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,320
what have you and the same tool can be

545
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,470
used on levers as well so on the left

546
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,389
this is from Carolina con last year when

547
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,529
I was demoing it to somebody and then

548
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,299
this is actually on one of my

549
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:24,460
assessments and you'll see I'm going to

550
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:24,460
trip that lever handle

551
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,320
tada

552
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,940
all right locks with thumb turn levers

553
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,580
this this one may be new for a lot of

554
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:47,510
people so you've seen these all over on

555
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,129
retail places right and you see the lock

556
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,830
in the out on the outside and then you

557
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,330
get this little little thumb turn we

558
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,760
typically find these on commercial

559
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,710
storefront doors where multiple

560
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,570
employees have to lock up and it's it

561
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,980
also is a safety issue if you had it

562
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,408
locked I mean the preference would be to

563
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,850
have a lock on the inside but if

564
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:07,850
somebody doesn't have the keys and they

565
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:10,639
need to get out we just can't have that

566
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:13,789
right so fire code will typically

567
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:16,039
prevent people from putting in a lock on

568
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:18,649
the inside so similar to the crash bar

569
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:20,990
bypass if there's any kind of gap in

570
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:23,299
between the two doors you can get this

571
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,850
thumb-turn bypass tool through the

572
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:28,519
center and this is actually a cable that

573
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:31,158
goes through here and when you turn the

574
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:34,399
little knob down here you saw what

575
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,110
happened it just turned so this if you

576
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:37,489
try to buy it in the US don't want to

577
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,830
charge you about a hundred dollars and

578
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,679
you have to provide some sort of proof

579
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,990
that you're in actually a locksmith

580
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,880
however if you want the link I can send

581
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,039
it to you you can get it for $12 from

582
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,929
China it might take a month but you know

583
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:57,230
might as well order five set oh so

584
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:59,480
here's the tool being used by me on an

585
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,340
audit what I did learn from from this

586
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,340
particular audit experience - this was

587
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:07,000
my first time using it was that that

588
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,110
that little clamp can be pretty slippery

589
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,750
wet as you're trying to turn it and it

590
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,428
kept it keeps sliding off so just put a

591
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,480
little bit of grip tape on the inside of

592
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:19,220
it and it'll grab on a little bit better

593
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,669
and that this is an add was right the

594
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,760
way this works is you can undo the lock

595
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:28,039
but the the locking bar that comes up

596
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,539
the latch is actually really substantial

597
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,490
so what I had to do was get it unlocked

598
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:34,419
and then I put the tool in there and

599
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,419
yank the latch down

600
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:41,830
I think a lot of people probably seen

601
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,570
this one right this this has got pretty

602
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,090
popular but I had to include this

603
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,769
because this is how I get in requests to

604
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:50,199
exit Center censors and we all

605
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:52,509
understand that this is what unlocks the

606
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,269
door as you're approaching it these will

607
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:56,860
typically only look for their passive

608
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:59,499
infrared so they're gonna look for heat

609
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,990
or I should say change in temperature

610
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:06,129
which is typically heat in the meat

611
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:07,570
space and some sort of motion so what

612
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:09,820
that means is that commonly available

613
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,340
canned air used for cleaning keyboards

614
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:16,720
when flipped upside down is super super

615
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:20,039
cold and you just spray it at the rec

616
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,039
center on the other side of the door

617
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:27,240
tada that is exactly what this draws for

618
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,710
yeah I was I was thank you for stealing

619
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,669
my thunder there Dan because I was

620
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:40,080
literally just gonna say here I've also

621
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:43,830
seen disposable hand warmers on a wire

622
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,360
helium balloons exhaled like vape smoke

623
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,980
deviant posted a video of him doing it

624
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:54,428
with some whiskey just walking down the

625
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:57,700
street and unlocked an ATM door now GE

626
00:28:54,429 --> 00:29:01,720
does make a what it's the RC R Rex this

627
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:04,090
actually employs I'm sorry this also

628
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,559
employs active radar so it's looking for

629
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,499
something roughly the size of a human

630
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,990
that is that is moving so this is the

631
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:13,090
only one that really can defend against

632
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:17,619
that attack it's sold under multiple

633
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:19,449
brand names people just om it Adam's

634
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:21,879
right so you'll see Adam's right all

635
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,879
over commercial storefront doors

636
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:26,949
typically and it's pretty much the most

637
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:30,149
common brand of hardware system for

638
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:34,330
retail in the US they typically have a

639
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:36,820
dead latch that's shown there and they

640
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,619
employ a mortise this is this is called

641
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,299
a mortise cylinder the little kick

642
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:41,470
cylinders that you have in your door at

643
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:44,139
home look a little different they're

644
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:48,760
smaller these are typically open on the

645
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:50,860
back so what you can do is reach through

646
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,240
the opening this is common theme right

647
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,570
if you don't have a protection in the

648
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,970
back you can reach through and this

649
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,620
bypass tool is specially angled in

650
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:05,110
design so that it can reach through and

651
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:07,030
oops hit the latch release lever right

652
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,979
there sorry not the latch release the

653
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,440
dead latch to release and then what you

654
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:15,820
can do is shim the lock like you would

655
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,690
with plastic sheets or you know a push

656
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,689
bar or something like that

657
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:23,440
Bosnian bill of course he has the best

658
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,710
breakdown of this so I recommend you go

659
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,390
watch that for for more detail I'm gonna

660
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:32,049
steal from Bosnia nabilla second time

661
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:34,059
here to the cab is simplex I don't see

662
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:37,809
this these as much as I used to but I

663
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:39,700
recently saw one of these on the jet

664
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:42,010
bridge as I was getting on an airplane I

665
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,870
looked over and went oh and I had my

666
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:47,470
magnet in my pocket because guess what

667
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:49,030
if you put a magnet on the side of this

668
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:52,330
you can defeat it and really what's

669
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:54,940
going on there's a linkage here if you

670
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,040
try to turn the handle this linkage just

671
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:00,520
collapses and it won't it won't open the

672
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:04,330
door if you put the magnet on the side

673
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:07,450
it pulls this flag out and by doing that

674
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:09,490
the linkage will now join up and stay

675
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,250
stay rigid which allows you to turn the

676
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,380
handle so basically you want to put this

677
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,630
super magnet in like a sock or something

678
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,460
so it doesn't get like stuck on the door

679
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,690
and you can't get it off especially if

680
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,240
it's like a metal door you're never

681
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:26,320
getting it off put it in a rag something

682
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:30,370
like that so just put it on there and it

683
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,990
opens up now it isn't very difficult to

684
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,059
change the password on these but we do

685
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,620
find a lot of them just still have the

686
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,928
same default passcode and it's a lot of

687
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,159
those like contractor put it in didn't

688
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:43,299
know what combo they wanted to use

689
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,520
assumed somebody was gonna you know put

690
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:48,120
put a different combo in so the trick

691
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,740
here is if you hit two and four

692
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,229
simultaneously and then hit three that's

693
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:57,070
the manufacturer or default so next time

694
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,210
you see one of these try it out or maybe

695
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,850
not

696
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,850
I probably shouldn't have said that okay

697
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:10,660
so everybody's seen key lock boxes

698
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,800
typically in commercial situations

699
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,560
you'll see them on the backs of

700
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,909
buildings your air B&B might have one

701
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,780
and they'll tell you the code to go get

702
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:22,960
get the key some municipalities

703
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,460
especially Toronto have problems with

704
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,370
these you know they're like filling up

705
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,570
stairwells and the entire railing out in

706
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,340
front of an apartment building is

707
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,590
absolutely coated with these these are

708
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,240
actual shots from the city of Toronto

709
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:37,240
where they're just all over the place

710
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,100
I'm gonna take you through every single

711
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:45,160
one of these lock boxes and how you can

712
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:47,889
get into them in 30 seconds or less it's

713
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,080
yeah it's air it's air BnB and yes I'm

714
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:55,150
never paying for an air BnB ever again

715
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,260
so this master is one of the most common

716
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:59,980
ones that you're gonna see it's the

717
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:02,950
5,400 rolling wheels for the combination

718
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:05,620
and like many rolling wheel combination

719
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:08,020
locks they can be decoded using a small

720
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:10,659
piece of feeler gauge so you stick this

721
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,970
in between the dials and as you rotate

722
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,670
it very slowly there will be a part

723
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,110
where your feeler gauge actually drops

724
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,930
in a little bit so you now you found the

725
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:22,840
notch and you go through one by one find

726
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:26,050
all the notches and then rotate the

727
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,449
wheel one air rotate all the wheels one

728
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:31,270
increment at a time until you find the

729
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,980
gate and it opens up now I was gonna do

730
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,770
a demo video for this but literally the

731
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:38,290
weekend I sat down I set up my my stuff

732
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:40,600
and my phone was literally looking at

733
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:41,280
this lock and I my YouTube notification

734
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,929
popped up

735
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,120
yeah thanks deviant just recorded this

736
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:48,060
like super detailed breakdown of it so I

737
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,570
wait well that's one I don't have to do

738
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:53,620
so go watch that one this one a number

739
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,570
of people played with this in the

740
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,090
village and the looks that I got when

741
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:02,080
people open it up were just like oh my

742
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:04,830
god this decoding method works not only

743
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:09,699
on this box but on numerous others and

744
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:11,719
basically what you do is put pressure on

745
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:14,168
the clear clear the combo

746
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:17,418
first and then put pressure on that

747
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:19,310
opening lever at the top and I'm pushing

748
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:22,158
on all the buttons and I'm feeling for

749
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:25,099
feedback pushing back against my finger

750
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,510
if you feel any sort of feedback that

751
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:29,149
number is probably part of the

752
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,060
combination most push button locks like

753
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:34,549
this you don't have to get the password

754
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,799
or the the combo in any sort of sequence

755
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,590
each of these buttons are on or off

756
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,629
switches essentially and you reset the

757
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,179
combo by flipping it around and you can

758
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:47,989
flip the the little knob on the back up

759
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:50,990
or down to create your own combo so 20

760
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:52,939
seconds I actually open one of these on

761
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:55,069
a recent engagement and it was super fun

762
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,599
because there were two keys in it

763
00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:04,010
one went to the telco room and the other

764
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,970
went to the fire control room in the

765
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,000
telco room

766
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,129
Sprint AT&T Time Warner all that they're

767
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,260
all coming in right and there's a laptop

768
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,530
sitting there on a little stand and I'm

769
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,180
like this is outta scope but I mean if I

770
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,440
just whack 'el the mouse that you know

771
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,098
there's no harm in that right

772
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,800
the thing is unlocked it comes up it is

773
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:27,770
literally connected to I probably

774
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,369
shouldn't say the name one of the telcos

775
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:33,500
fiber patch panels and I'm familiar with

776
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:35,660
that piece of software and it was

777
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,859
basically authenticated so I literally

778
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,200
could have gone in and just move

779
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:41,060
people's stuff around or maybe put in a

780
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,160
man-in-the-middle device or some pork

781
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,619
some kind the other one at the other

782
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,359
room was even better the fire room had a

783
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:50,990
little box mounted on the side of the

784
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:55,009
wall and it was full he's guess what

785
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:57,109
they were the keys hid cards alarm key

786
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,900
fobs all that for the entire building

787
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:02,060
and all the all the tenants so it was

788
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,570
just absolutely devastating so you're

789
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:08,450
using this real low security device to

790
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:12,619
protect high security devices I mean

791
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:14,118
there were like Schlage Everest keys in

792
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:17,450
there which is very you know it's a

793
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:19,820
difficult pick but you know sorry I

794
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:24,850
could go on about that one

795
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:26,440
the master 5422 D and 54:23 D

796
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:29,110
the difference is one has the the

797
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,660
shackle up here one doesn't master was

798
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:33,340
trying to up their game and they made

799
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,649
this with this what they call anti

800
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,840
jamming which is that decoding method

801
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:41,710
when I'm I'm kind of jamming on the

802
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,390
button to feel some feedback it removes

803
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,720
the feedback from the latch mechanism

804
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:48,640
and as you're as you're pushing on the

805
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,200
latch and you push down on the buttons

806
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,819
you'll actually hear it pop it'll drop

807
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,750
in and at our last oak City locks port

808
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,510
meeting in May

809
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,890
I gave one of these to one of our

810
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,080
members who's like super good at

811
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,629
decoding and he actually figured out how

812
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,950
to beat this so I am dropping an O'Day

813
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:10,060
today I've checked with lots of tool

814
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,210
chapter leads and they have never heard

815
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:16,090
of this attack before okay so here's the

816
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:20,740
owed a credit to David s who figured

817
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:23,020
this out so it's super easy and it was

818
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:26,799
it shocked me you take a tension wrench

819
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:29,290
and you push it down where the combo

820
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,150
reset button is you just jam it in there

821
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:34,720
and then you do the same thing that you

822
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,730
did with the kiddy box this is like wait

823
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,799
a minute they put in anti jamming and it

824
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,810
was supposed to protect against this but

825
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,240
one stupid little tension wrench takes

826
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,850
all that protection away the feedback

827
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,529
that you get is a lot more nuanced then

828
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,420
with the the kidiot like you're feeling

829
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,760
it push back really hard this is a

830
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,860
little more nuanced but once he told me

831
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,480
the trick and he had changed the code in

832
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,610
the box so I had no clue what it was it

833
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,700
took me twenty seconds to get in it was

834
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:02,770
crazy

835
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,930
so I will post it I actually recorded

836
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,790
like a three minute video of me breaking

837
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:09,220
it down and going through it I'll be

838
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:12,730
posting that on YouTube and I'll tweet

839
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,049
that out as well alright so tubular

840
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,170
locks I'm not really going to cover this

841
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:19,090
in any great depth but tubular locks are

842
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:21,340
essentially pin tumbler locks the

843
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,380
difference here is they have a round key

844
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,420
way and the pins are oriented

845
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,570
differently so the round key fits into

846
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:31,480
it it pushes in the pins to different

847
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:33,850
depths based on the cuts in the key and

848
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,820
then you hit the shear line and it

849
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,630
allows it to turn they have lots of

850
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,619
applications like back

851
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:44,210
again backup for an electronic safe and

852
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:47,119
you'll see an obviously computer store

853
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:50,359
our computer security cables the

854
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,359
occasional storage box that's mounted

855
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:55,549
above a door so you have the key to the

856
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,970
key to the really highly secure door

857
00:38:55,549 --> 00:39:01,609
with this real garbage tubular lock on

858
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:04,069
it and you can actually take a tubular

859
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:05,660
they call it a tubular pick but you're

860
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:08,420
not like picking at the individual pins

861
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:11,930
it's an impression a device so you put a

862
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:15,440
little bit of tension on the ring on the

863
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:17,690
outside and then push this in and rotate

864
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,940
it back and forth and based on the

865
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,529
pressure of the springs coming back at

866
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:26,660
it it pushes the pins up and you can

867
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:28,519
actually form a key using this it's not

868
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,019
hard to do per se but it does take a

869
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:34,008
little bit of practice to kind of get it

870
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:35,720
right so Knox boxes I just want to touch

871
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:38,239
on this quick because people will see

872
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,160
these now and go well you could get into

873
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:44,509
that kiddy box you might be able to get

874
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:48,319
into this right no these these are they

875
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:52,910
have a medic medico biaxial lock that is

876
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:55,819
super hard to pick these these boxes

877
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:59,569
when they're sent from Knox they're sent

878
00:39:55,819 --> 00:40:01,099
with a key that only Knox has access to

879
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:03,109
the key blank is not available to

880
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:05,089
locksmiths if you need another key you

881
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:07,430
have to order it from Knox there are

882
00:40:05,089 --> 00:40:10,339
designated contacts from a municipality

883
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:12,200
that are authorized to order keys and

884
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:15,589
they're all numbered individually so if

885
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,419
one goes missing and it's found you know

886
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:19,729
exactly who lost that key so they can

887
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,680
come after you these these are used and

888
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:23,479
you'll see them six to eight feet away

889
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,660
from like a main entrance to a building

890
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:29,899
they're used to store access key key

891
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:31,969
cards actual keys anything that the fire

892
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,319
department or you know any law

893
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:37,339
enforcement needs to get into the

894
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:39,349
building when the the tenant wants to

895
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:40,880
put something into the box they don't

896
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:42,890
even have access so they have to call

897
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,099
the fire department have them come out

898
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:48,828
put everything in close it up you will

899
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:53,260
have one master key for an entire munis

900
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:57,140
municipal area that might be a problem

901
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:59,750
because accidents happen and if somebody

902
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,430
does lose one of these keys and the

903
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,530
person who finds it knows what it is

904
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:06,379
they now have access to probably every

905
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:09,530
single building in town and in the case

906
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:12,560
of Austin that somebody lost their key

907
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:15,500
and the guy that found it actually went

908
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,700
around robbing hospitals and they

909
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,839
couldn't figure out what was going on

910
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,819
they finally got him on surveillance

911
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,670
video and it was a three hundred

912
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:24,440
thousand dollar charge to go back and

913
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:27,770
replace the lock on every single one of

914
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,380
these boxes there there is actually a

915
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:32,869
tamper switch on these so that when the

916
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,609
box is opened you can actually have an

917
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:36,380
alarm go off so we know okay somebody

918
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:38,839
open the box but in most cases people

919
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:43,540
don't even bother to hook it up so they

920
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:46,009
didn't know what was going on so

921
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:48,079
sometimes you can actually have the key

922
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:52,450
that you need in your go bag already and

923
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,450
the reason for this is common keys

924
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,240
basically manufacturers will use the

925
00:41:56,089 --> 00:42:01,369
same exact lock in their products so

926
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,810
they will they'll want to order a bunch

927
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:06,349
of locks but you know what it's a lot

928
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:08,299
cheaper to instead of ordering thousands

929
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:10,369
of key different locks just order one

930
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,630
lock that has the exact same code on

931
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:13,040
everything and it's fully

932
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:17,390
interchangeable you don't have to worry

933
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:20,029
about which one you've got so key - like

934
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,310
your common key systems deviant and

935
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:25,400
Howard Payne covered this in their talk

936
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:27,349
at the 11th hope this key is is your key

937
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,420
this key is my key so I'm gonna do a

938
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:30,829
quick overview and I've actually got

939
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,290
another extra nugget here that they

940
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:37,790
didn't cover that Howard helped me out

941
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:39,770
with so if you've you've seen this talk

942
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,810
in some of deviants other ones he has a

943
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:43,520
little keychain I call mine my keychain

944
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:49,430
of doom I keep these on them all the

945
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:51,410
time so see for15 a 501 C H in 751 these

946
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:55,160
will get you into just about any cabinet

947
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:57,348
anywhere voting machines that was fun

948
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,770
jukeboxes so you can have unlimited

949
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:02,930
songs industrial control switches and

950
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:05,240
toolboxes I actually went to Home Depot

951
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,140
with these and there was like unlock

952
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,058
unlock

953
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:11,808
online I like all the way down the down

954
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:14,480
on the row was crazy and if you know the

955
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:16,430
stuff I should say that the 751 the

956
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,529
ladies in my barbershop love me for this

957
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:21,890
I actually left one there with one of

958
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:23,930
the girls because the owner wouldn't

959
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,900
turn the a/c up very much in the summer

960
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:30,200
and I was sweltering I'm like it is

961
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:31,970
really hot in here and I saw the the

962
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,230
thermostat had this plastic box on it

963
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:35,269
and I'm like if I could do something

964
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:38,089
about that but you guys want me to

965
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:39,979
adjust the AC yeah so I got out seven

966
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:41,089
five one opened it up and I'm like let

967
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,099
me just leave this with you

968
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:45,099
so they were able to close it back up so

969
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:51,470
in if you don't have a key and it's in a

970
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,210
it's in a location that maybe you visit

971
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,038
on a regular basis or you've had the

972
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:58,160
opportunity to walk into a business and

973
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:01,880
do some recon start looking at the face

974
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,769
of locks right they may have a direct or

975
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,510
indirect bidding code stamped right on

976
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:08,029
the face of the lock that you can then

977
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,869
go look up and order the key that fits

978
00:44:08,029 --> 00:44:14,269
that lock you can also do stuff like

979
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:16,279
look at the the model or the

980
00:44:14,269 --> 00:44:18,558
manufacturer of like office furniture

981
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:21,039
and stuff Curren and Miller you know you

982
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,259
name it you can literally go online and

983
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:27,069
order a master key for the entire system

984
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:29,269
of filing cabinets and secure storage

985
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:30,680
which is exactly what I did when I

986
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:32,508
bought some used office furniture and

987
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,190
they're like four different keys I'm

988
00:44:32,509 --> 00:44:40,279
like well I could order four keys

989
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:42,740
or just the one master key elevator Lots

990
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:45,799
have gotten a lot of fanfare especially

991
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:49,368
these emergency like fire or emergency

992
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:51,079
operation keys the fe okay one is the

993
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:53,119
most common one that's like the

994
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:56,750
universal standard unless you're in a

995
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:59,359
state that has a local standard so you

996
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:03,680
know that if you are going to be in a

997
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,299
particular locale and they have like one

998
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,190
that's mandated by the state you can

999
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:09,099
just order the one that the state uses

1000
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:12,640
and now you have control of the elevator

1001
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:15,470
you may remember the incident where the

1002
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,529
reporter in New York City posted this

1003
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:19,160
one that was like the New York City

1004
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:20,630
standard

1005
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,250
and they gotten a lot of trouble for it

1006
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,350
but I'm honestly it really not

1007
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,880
surprising at all right that law

1008
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:29,089
enforcement and Fire Department would

1009
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:32,120
actually have one of these so here's the

1010
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:33,710
extra nugget that I'm dropping fire

1011
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,870
emergency keys have gotten a bunch of

1012
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,180
publicity but if you use one of these on

1013
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:41,180
a pen test chances are it's going to be

1014
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:44,690
really freaking noisy when you engage

1015
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,910
the fire emergency key what happens is

1016
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:49,310
it says oh we need to let all the fire

1017
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,779
personnel into the building how are they

1018
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:53,509
going to get in but probably on the

1019
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,280
first floor not the third so all of the

1020
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:57,500
elevators in the entire building will go

1021
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,480
to the ground level right so if you're

1022
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,400
trying to get in and there's there's

1023
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,720
other people in the building if all the

1024
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,440
elevators go to the ground floor at the

1025
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,899
same time the super suspicious right so

1026
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,110
so I talked to Howard I'm like what can

1027
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:15,110
I do to be less noisy and he said well

1028
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:17,840
you don't want to use a fire are you ki

1029
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:19,190
so I'm like okay but there's there's

1030
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,280
tons of them I don't know which ones to

1031
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:24,380
use Howard is actually I'm gonna get his

1032
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,540
title wrong but he's like an elevator

1033
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,180
inspector he's been working at elevators

1034
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,740
for years so he basically said here's my

1035
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,950
list if you're gonna go out and acquire

1036
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:36,709
supervisory keys this will open you know

1037
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:38,350
most of or this will will operate most

1038
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:41,810
of the elevators you'll find in the US

1039
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:47,000
so take a picture of that one and it'll

1040
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:49,790
be posted you'll see these on apartment

1041
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,320
complexes and businesses where you might

1042
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:56,560
need to talk to a security guard to get

1043
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,560
in these telephony access control boxes

1044
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:01,970
unfortunately the top two sellers in the

1045
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,270
market door King and linear they've put

1046
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:07,580
common keys on these so the other thing

1047
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:10,130
I have on my my keychain of doom is a

1048
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:12,020
key for each of these and essentially

1049
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,090
when you open up the front faceplate of

1050
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:16,520
the cabinet on door King they literally

1051
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:19,070
have a momentary switch you can press

1052
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,440
the switch and whatever things it's

1053
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:25,010
controlling what will open up on the

1054
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,170
linear there's a there's a terminal that

1055
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,940
you actually have to short out and you

1056
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,790
just carry a little piece of wire make

1057
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,000
that that can

1058
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:37,350
and you know it opens up the the thing

1059
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,440
to be aware of though is this linear

1060
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:42,360
actually has a tamper switch in it and

1061
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,370
if you open it up of course somebody's

1062
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,470
going to get alerted however just like

1063
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:49,380
the Kappa simplex if you put a magnet

1064
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:50,939
right up here that that switch is just a

1065
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,490
read switch it's just a thin piece of

1066
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,100
metal that that goes back and forth so

1067
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:57,540
if you can keep it

1068
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:00,120
hello if you can keep it against the

1069
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,730
side of the box then nobody's the wiser

1070
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,290
so put it up there open it up do your

1071
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:08,340
thing close it up take the magnet off

1072
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:11,009
nobody knows Dennis Maldonado had a

1073
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:13,740
great talk on this particular system at

1074
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:15,360
Def Con 23 he gets super super in-depth

1075
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:19,609
so if you're interested in learning more

1076
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,610
about that one look up his talk

1077
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:28,460
alright so black bag when I'm like a

1078
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,170
proponent of having a black bag that

1079
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,090
orgo bag that you use for engagements

1080
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:36,120
and I literally have a redundant copy of

1081
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:38,250
everything in my my fun you know play

1082
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,259
around collection in my go bag so I

1083
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:43,680
don't have to worry did I pick this up

1084
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,880
or not and you know you don't have to go

1085
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,730
through a checklist or anything like

1086
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,070
that I personally just use an old laptop

1087
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:52,320
backpack that was given to me from some

1088
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:55,410
corporate thing because it looks super

1089
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:57,780
corporate and like nobody's gonna you

1090
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:02,640
know it doesn't look like Tac Toe bro so

1091
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:05,280
nobody's really gonna question it so

1092
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,230
your bag doesn't have to be black but

1093
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,420
some of the essential things for your

1094
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:11,220
black bag your get-out-of-jail-free or

1095
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,990
authorization to test letter super

1096
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,899
important if you're doing this like

1097
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:17,850
after hours and nobody knows about it

1098
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:20,910
and the bag should kind of fit your

1099
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:24,110
pretext for me the laptop thing works

1100
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:26,370
cuz I'm a middle-aged like white dude

1101
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:29,520
with a laptop backpack it's super

1102
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:33,330
non-threatening if you're a woman like

1103
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:35,490
play to people's stereotypes of you have

1104
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,600
a big purse right they just won't even

1105
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,270
they won't even think of it

1106
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,950
if those types of pretext don't work for

1107
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,410
you of course the the one that everybody

1108
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:46,319
talks about the yellow maintenance vest

1109
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,730
with a clipboard deviance is shown like

1110
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,960
he'll have a clipboard that's like

1111
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,910
really thick one of the ones with the

1112
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,119
lid that opens and you can have a bunch

1113
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:57,118
of your tools in there basically fit

1114
00:49:54,119 --> 00:50:01,200
preconceptions fit into people's desire

1115
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:04,470
to help and you'll get pretty far so

1116
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,410
specific tool wise I pretty much covered

1117
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:10,230
all of these the ones that I didn't

1118
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:12,480
cover that I keep in my bag all the time

1119
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:15,599
I've got a couple of different plantable

1120
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,160
micro cameras a little body camera that

1121
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,049
you can have running the entire time

1122
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,960
that's like the little pen form factor

1123
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:24,450
completely innocuous it'll help with

1124
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,890
recording and engagement as well as like

1125
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:27,839
just standing the right way and

1126
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:31,980
capturing somebody punching in a pin

1127
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:35,308
code tape is used for neutralizing door

1128
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:36,869
latches so if you can get in or somebody

1129
00:50:35,309 --> 00:50:38,849
opens the door and you're not going in

1130
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:40,319
you know I'll hold the door for you and

1131
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:42,690
you're not trying to get in but you just

1132
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,130
put a piece of tape on the latch and now

1133
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:49,710
you can go along later and just open it

1134
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:51,359
up and then the magnetic pole detector

1135
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,579
is used for detecting whether or not a

1136
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,799
door that you're going to try to get

1137
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,240
through is alarmed or not and you

1138
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:59,309
literally just run it all the way around

1139
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:02,520
the outside of the door and you'll see

1140
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:03,329
the polarity indicator flip so now you

1141
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,538
know either

1142
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:08,039
don't work on that door or there's some

1143
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:09,480
alarm bypass method so you can go

1144
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:14,220
through using magnets and things like

1145
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:16,470
that so that is that is it for the black

1146
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,709
bag so some of the some of my

1147
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:22,049
conclusions here don't go for the

1148
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:25,170
advanced stuff first right do your basic

1149
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:28,859
patching proper install don't allow gaps

1150
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:31,079
around around your doors and stuff don't

1151
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:33,538
assume that an access control device is

1152
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:35,789
going to be used the way it was designed

1153
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:38,309
to work obviously all those bypass

1154
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:41,069
attacks we exploited a flaw in the

1155
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:44,640
design don't rely on a less secure

1156
00:51:41,069 --> 00:51:48,210
method to secure high security keys and

1157
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,578
do your research so if you're gonna pick

1158
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:54,440
up a lock or if you've brought one home

1159
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:57,960
looking on lock picking 101 go to the

1160
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,970
lock picking reddit go to youtube find

1161
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,819
that lock and you can literally Google

1162
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:06,089
like to make make and manufacture the

1163
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:08,400
lock and bypass or picking and if you

1164
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:11,210
can find a exploit for it

1165
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:16,279
ditch that lock and get something else

1166
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:16,279
and with that thank you that's all I got
