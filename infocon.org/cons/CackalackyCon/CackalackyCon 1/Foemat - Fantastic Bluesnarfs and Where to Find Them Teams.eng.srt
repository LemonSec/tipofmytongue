00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,949
you know somebody's using their handle

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,780
don't go out and start using their real

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,979
name you know and if it might just I

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,140
don't care somebody calls about my real

37
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,320

journey the wrong way I just bought this

51
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:28,620
this week so disclaimer I'm not a

52
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,840
Bluetooth expert right if you if you

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,270
listen to the extract go to extract

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,470
extract grammar police still hate me

55
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:41,490
even when I talk the abstract so I did

56
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,830
this as a beginner right I did this

57
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,480
because I want to learn bluetooth I want

58
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,310
to mess with it a lot of people don't

59
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,570
talk about it around here but as I

60
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,910
started talking about the possibility of

61
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,130
doing this a lot of you in this local

62
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,570
area said hey that would be awesome

63
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,090
I'd love to see this from a beginner

64
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,320
standpoint but I don't want to do it and

65
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,730
I don't have time to do it so yeah you

66
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,680
go do it so I'm doing it um everybody

67
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,079
says that these are my opinions not my

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,490
employers they may or may not know that

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,240
I'm doing this tonight that may might

70
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,620
not be why I'm saying don't Doc's me bro

71
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,450
all right so why am I doing this talk

72
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,520
I've always had a big interest in

73
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,238
Bluetooth you know some of this is due

74
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,160
to madness shenanigans on mine frame

75
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,260
right what could I do with bluetooth

76
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,290
that would be funny but not necessarily

77
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,190
destructive I use a lot of Bluetooth

78
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,929
connected devices

79
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,790
everybody does they're all over the

80
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,580
place I love to learn and figure out

81
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,560
stuff I felt there's a lack of Bluetooth

82
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,870
talks at cons or at least the ones that

83
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,489
I visit you know I have seen other cars

84
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,730
I'm not going to make it to somebody's

85
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,590
talking about bluetooth I stayed in

86
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,170
pretty local right now so it's like hey

87
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,150
I want some Bluetooth stuff a lot of

88
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,369
people seem to have an interest in this

89
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,110
especially in this particular talk from

90
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,170
what y'all told me if you don't have any

91
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,330
interest you lied to me and I wanted to

92
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,440
step out of my comfort zone right I

93
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,660
didn't want to come up here and talk

94
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,880
about something that I truly knew about

95
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,470
you know stuff that I knew about there's

96
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,150
a lot of SMEs out there for it there's

97
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,980
talks about them all over the place I

98
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,530
didn't want to be just that oh here's

99
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,858
another talk about y'all and what is

100
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,470
something a little different so and then

101
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:23,270
also BAE 16 was like hey foam at talk

102
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,270
about a thing I said okay

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:33,770
so a thing so step one what tools are

104
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:36,258
available so from a beginner Nouman

105
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,419
frame one of the first things I did is

106
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:41,440
what we like to do right let's see what

107
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:44,419
Callie says so I bought of Kali Linux

108
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,909
just went to the favorites when in a

109
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:55,159
wireless here's our Bluetooth okay so

110
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:58,370
we've got some options here then Google

111
00:04:55,159 --> 00:05:04,099
Play Store let's see what Bluetooth type

112
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:08,240
apps we can find out on google play set

113
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:09,530
to research the tools so if you do know

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,930
me you know there's gonna be lots of

115
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,669
panda crap going on here there could be

116
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,909
some literal playing to crap I don't

117
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:19,340
know there might be like a raffle later

118
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:21,530
so I also wanted to say I did not watch

119
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,530
any videos from cons about Bluetooth

120
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,419
talks I did this on purpose I did not

121
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,758
want my talk to be influenced by

122
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:30,109
somebody else's con talk I've never

123
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:35,919
watched a conference talk about

124
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:39,099
Bluetooth alright hit the wrong button

125
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,750
when I grow up I want to be an F note

126
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:44,150
I'm gonna start tonight by hitting the

127
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:49,580
laser button instead of the next button

128
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:56,150
Oh evidently that works I think I'm

129
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:58,448
becoming EF noob alright so what did you

130
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,090
do to research this I tried to focus on

131
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:04,310
tutorials that are put out by the

132
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,948
creators of the devices or creators of

133
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,840
the tools you know doesn't mean that I

134
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,240
didn't run into a couple where somebody

135
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,239
else like me right now said hey I wanted

136
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,009
to do this thing this is how I did it

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,310
sometimes I had to do that sometimes the

138
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:20,779
the creator of the Creator sometimes I

139
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,150
don't know what even call that anymore

140
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:25,880
the manufacturer of this tool

141
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,679
whatever developer there we go so

142
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,940
sometimes the developers don't have that

143
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,060
much about it they're like hey here's a

144
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,070
tool this is what the tool can do they

145
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,190
may or may not even say how to install

146
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,300
it so if you don't have cat

147
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,920
it's not on Callie good luck right so in

148
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,380
this cases I might have read through a

149
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,330
few other tutorials I google the crap

150
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,030
out of it you know I read through

151
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:53,430
Twitter and through blog post and of

152
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:57,270
course - - help in Linux wonderful thing

153
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:00,480
so step three chickens

154
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,250
I just thought something with a laser

155
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,560
you're gonna have so much fun with this

156
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,290
yeah we saw that sticker somewhere right

157
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,630
so Ryan bear may not have had anything

158
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,760
to do with the fact that that same is a

159
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:19,740
sticker of my laptop right now thanks

160
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:21,870
brah love ya alright so platforms so I

161
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,380
started this by doing using Kali Linux

162
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,440
2019 and VirtualBox also Kali Linux on a

163
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:33,180
bare metal laptop and raspbian stretch

164
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:37,190
on a Raspberry Pi 3 so other hardware

165
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:40,890
used uber tooth one a wonder tooth one

166
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:45,630
panda and a Bluetooth adapter and the

167
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:47,580
crowbar from half-life 2 so software is

168
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,850
I tried everything that's available in

169
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,550
Kali and also for the phone I decided to

170
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:56,790
check out ramble and then the uber tooth

171
00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:02,460
tools that are part of upper tooth so

172
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:08,669
step forward the test drive you like

173
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:11,250
that right so ramble now this is this

174
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:13,530
first picture is kind of poor but it's a

175
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,940
bad screenshot that's just what the home

176
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,159
screen looks like when you first open it

177
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,390
up so this is the app that's on the

178
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,669
phone you can get it from Google Play

179
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:24,960
Store I don't know if this one Apple I

180
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:26,430
don't have an iPhone alright so one

181
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,310
thing that I like about this is when you

182
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:33,780
do a search and you can see I redacted

183
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:35,820
the crap out of this but the details

184
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,559
that you can get from devices now it's

185
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,909
not always going to give you the name of

186
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,709
what it is just like anything when

187
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,030
you're doing Bluetooth scan and you get

188
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,720
a lot of stuff that comes up and says no

189
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,760
name

190
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,090
I picked this one just because it does

191
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,160
have a name it was cool so it's going to

192
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:53,640
show you the MAC address what I really

193
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,490
love about this is this part first scene

194
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,040
last scene right now this particular

195
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,900
device I just saw it that day but if

196
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,490
it's a device that either say you go to

197
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,860
a particular restaurant or you're just

198
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,630
doing this at your house it's a device

199
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,910
that you've seen before it's gonna tell

200
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,610
you the first time you saw it could have

201
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,959
been 2 or 3 months ago it's going to

202
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,730
show you something more you'd at that

203
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,200
moment when you last saw it you can also

204
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,550
go back through your history and look up

205
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,130
stuff even when you're not running it

206
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:23,430
you can also do favorites so I'd

207
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,080
actually did a favorite on this one so I

208
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,569
can go back into my favorites do a quick

209
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,850
view and see it another thing that's

210
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,410
really really cool about this is the map

211
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,260
feature which that's where the most

212
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:37,230
redactions are right here so if you just

213
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,550
touch this map it's going to take you to

214
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,830
this next page where you've got some

215
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,630
options right here so you got the

216
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,700
markers the heat map and the satellite

217
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,260
so with the markers it's gonna kind of

218
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,520
show you where it seemed that Bluetooth

219
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,200
device and this is not going to be a

220
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,310
hundred percent accurate if you've done

221
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,460
anything with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi

222
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,719
anything with GPS you know that this

223
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,210
stuff is not gonna be a hundred percent

224
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,270
on point so you gotta kind of look at it

225
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,940
from that viewpoint so let's change that

226
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,860
from the markers to the heat map you can

227
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,390
see in some cases you actually get this

228
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,090
little solid fluid line you can see how

229
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:14,580
shaky my hands are I'm not an alcohol

230
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:16,590
like a promise right so well let's check

231
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,900
out the satellite view I thought this

232
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,780
was kind of cool right this is awesome

233
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,340
for doing recon because it can help you

234
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,990
kind of pinpoint where it was that when

235
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,500
you saw it so if you're going back later

236
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:32,450
and yeah you've got the address but it's

237
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,280
just fun or to see the pictures right so

238
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,140
and you can also have the heat map or

239
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,240
the markers activated where you're on

240
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,400
satellite view so that was also pretty

241
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,230
nice personally I like the heat map

242
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,400
better than the markers I just think it

243
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,400
looks more predator like

244
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:54,279
okay so my opinions on ramble so it's

245
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,500
simple and fun to use

246
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,850
right it's cool for recon without

247
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,100
detection because you're doing it from

248
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,000
your phone you don't have your laptop up

249
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,290
when you're in the middle of a

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,730
restaurant if you wanted to recon a

251
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,959
restaurant not that I'm saying this

252
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:11,079
stuff illegally right it's not perfect

253
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,189
but it is free so it's not going to be

254
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,469
the best scanner that you're going to

255
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:18,329
find but it's really fun to use really

256
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:22,779
simple to use so definitely check it out

257
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:26,019
so next is the basic Linux bluetooth

258
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:28,449
commands so this comes typically almost

259
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,790
any Linux system you may or may not have

260
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:33,779
to install it but I believe it's

261
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,779
everyone I've ever used it's up there

262
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,779
right

263
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:47,500
okay so typically most all my

264
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,720
experiences when doing that when doing

265
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,920
anything Bluetooth or Linux I usually

266
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,110
have to run some commands to get

267
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,870
bluetooth up and running before your

268
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:59,769
device will actually be recognized okay

269
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,540
so for the service bluetooth start will

270
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:04,870
actually start the service now I'm also

271
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,699
putting this last slide here you don't

272
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,689
have to use service bluetooth or you can

273
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:13,240
also just type in ncnd bluetooth and

274
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:17,139
then you can put start or stop or status

275
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,550
there instead um is for some people it's

276
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:22,750
easier to just remember service

277
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:25,389
bluetooth start alright so then we've

278
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,970
got HCI config this displays your

279
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:29,319
available adapters in which interface

280
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,350
that adapters own so if you've got

281
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:34,540
multiple adapters you definitely want to

282
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:38,949
do this so you can see which is which

283
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:42,189
and then HCI config then the interface

284
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:44,589
and up this enables that particular

285
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:47,189
interface now if you've got multiple

286
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,990
interfaces and you only want to use one

287
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:52,480
it might be helpful in some cases to

288
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,120
actually do this command with the other

289
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,500
interface and say down because there's

290
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,269
been times when I was doing some of this

291
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,250
test and was even though I never told it

292
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:01,290
to put it

293
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,910
it was still picking that up and I was

294
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,260
getting I didn't want that for a

295
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,870
particular test I was doing so it was

296
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,560
kind of like you know just extra noise

297
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:12,270
so just turn it off so if you have

298
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,069
multiple adapters you only you just wind

299
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,510
up I see I thought the head of my slides

300
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,990
y'all can see I don't always read from

301
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,700
slides

302
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,370
these are bullet points so I don't

303
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,930
forget stuff okay so now for other

304
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,720
commands and these are still the

305
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,819
commands that are basic with Linux just

306
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,240
not Callie in general we're just not

307
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,030
Kali Linux in general whatever so HCI

308
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,890
tool scan this performs the scan for

309
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:40,110
Bluetooth devices and displays the MAC

310
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:42,390
address and device name l2p so this is

311
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,740
going to show the MAC address or excuse

312
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:46,050
me you got to actually put the MAC

313
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,750
address there so LTP and then the MAC

314
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:53,760
address this performs ping to devices

315
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:58,250
the Bluetooth adapter then L to ping MAC

316
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,410
address - f so this does a flood ping

317
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,230
I've kind of got some little cool ideas

318
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:06,810
about that particular command I might

319
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,080
talk about that a minute and then you

320
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,060
got SDP tool browse and MAC address so

321
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,920
this pulls additional information that's

322
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,260
useful for retrieving the channels to

323
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,520
connect to so these are cool thing with

324
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,250
these commands and why you want to know

325
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,500
is you're gonna find as you start using

326
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,930
the other tools you're gonna need some

327
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,160
of this information right you start

328
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,290
looking at commands it's kind of like

329
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,569
hey your options you need to add the

330
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:35,040
channel you're gonna use this on okay

331
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:36,710
how do I get my channel stb - so these

332
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,670
are great little basic commands I

333
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,000
suggest even if you don't have any

334
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:48,930
special devices play with them all right

335
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,670
so let's try a demo here and here's the

336
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:54,719
best part right my demo is actually in

337
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:59,240
Kali Linux luckily this boots up fast in

338
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,240
my VM that was not very prepared

339
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,040
and I said it boots some fast so it's

340
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,040
taking forever

341
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:27,019
doo-doo-doo-doo Oh actually let me do it

342
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:28,759
like this F noob F dude let's just go to

343
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:56,149
move the final jeopardy put me on my

344
00:15:28,759 --> 00:16:28,459
misery there's so many things I want to

345
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:30,649
say to the conversation so this is a

346
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:33,888
recorded demo so you don't have to worry

347
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:37,540
about your devices at this minute I'm

348
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,540
cheating I'm cheating a little bit here

349
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,910
okay so I'm about to play this this is

350
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,050
gonna kind of fast

351
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,620
you want me to replayed I'll do it a

352
00:16:54,050 --> 00:17:01,120
couple times so this particular one is

353
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,120
going to go over the flood ping

354
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,099
sometimes I'll type slow it's all good

355
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:19,290
actually I forgot say I didn't rewatch

356
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:27,990
this recently it's not go making any

357
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:29,460
larger can you'll see that okay okay so

358
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,930
what I'm doing here is I just basically

359
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,660
started the service like I spoke about

360
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,790
did to HCI config and you'll see that

361
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,300
there is multiple adapters on this

362
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:46,200
device and then now I'm doing the flood

363
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:47,669
peeing and watch this thing fly so you

364
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,320
see that flood ping goes really fast

365
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,340
maybe I should have done a regular ping

366
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,260
so I could see the difference between

367
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,389
the two regular pings just like if

368
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,080
you're doing a your normal ping for your

369
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,760
only internet you know it's just it's a

370
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,370
typical peeing where you do a flood ping

371
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,379
that things flying so I've kind of got

372
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,139
some ideas in my head and now when I say

373
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,080
this number one remember I am a noob I'm

374
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:13,320
a beginner of this and I'm not going

375
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,270
over the is it practical versus is it

376
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,300
possible because what I'm about to say

377
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,970
it might not be that very practical but

378
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:24,930
it's more about the possibility so what

379
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:27,780
if you use this command you know made a

380
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,670
nice little script and then you started

381
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:33,090
pinging somebody's cellphone with the

382
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,770
flood ping okay now I will say my cell

383
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,419
phone and testing it would reset a

384
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,450
connection but what if your script

385
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:43,020
restarted every down then and then what

386
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:46,430
if you put this on I don't know like 20

387
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,870
raspberry pod W's in a box and that

388
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,440
scripts doing that over and over and

389
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,129
over again

390
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,720
good my battery life you know practical

391
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,300
maybe not there could be other useful

392
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,210
ways of you know Dawson somebody but

393
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,419
possible I think so so I may or may not

394
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,160
try that later we'll see what happens

395
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,850
not not later tonight I promise and that

396
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,620
later this weekend I don't have all the

397
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:14,540
devices needed for that

398
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,540
I don't like tripods

399
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,850
so a shout out to a smoker for

400
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,940
sacrificing to the demo gods earlier cuz

401
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,590
that did actually work for me so if

402
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,160
everybody else's demos go bad it's

403
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:46,709
because I used up the power so tools and

404
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,630
Kali Linux and I put 20 19 here I

405
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:52,710
literally just installed for a lot of

406
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:54,750
this I reinstalled it now one thing I

407
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,920
want to mention who actually I'm gonna

408
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,990
get to that later I don't wanna get

409
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:03,330
ahead of myself so tools and kali linux

410
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,550
blue log I found this to be great for

411
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,699
doing site surveys but it only really

412
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,950
shows visible devices so you know if

413
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,660
they're not displayed and showing is

414
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,429
visible you're not going to find hidden

415
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:19,260
devices so here's a few commands here

416
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:21,540
I'm not gonna go too much in depth in

417
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,429
this but the options in this particular

418
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,159
command will try to pull the

419
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:28,230
manufacturer name device name and device

420
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,660
class of any devices at fonds and it's

421
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,809
going to put it in a log file now I will

422
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,910
say typically I love doing verbose mode

423
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,470
this particular tool I found if you do

424
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,570
it in Reverse mode it's not going to

425
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,220
show you a lot of this information it

426
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,570
doesn't seem to pull the manufacturer

427
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,120
information and throw it up on the

428
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,010
screen if you do it a log file you get a

429
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,159
lot more information for some reason I

430
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:56,610
don't know why I'm not the dev I'm a

431
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:58,350
noob okay so blue ranger so this is a

432
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,570
script and this kind of gets back to

433
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,490
what I was saying earlier you know about

434
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,710
hey what if I did a script for the flood

435
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,990
ping so this is a script that uses the

436
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,330
l2 peen command to determine the

437
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:11,790
location of the device based off of link

438
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:14,909
quality so this was actually kind of

439
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,620
cool to mess around with it's very

440
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,660
simple you just do your Blue Ranger to

441
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,909
SH put the interface in that you're

442
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,059
going to use on your device at a MAC

443
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,730
address I think this would be best on a

444
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,529
portable device

445
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,360
so that way you could walk around this

446
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:31,460
could be great for fun in a rug device

447
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,600
we're trying to hunt down maybe somebody

448
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,139
particular if you wanna have some type

449
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:39,730
of little Bluetooth games we'll see

450
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:39,729
maybe a future event at a con

451
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:46,279
all right so blue star fur so this can

452
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:49,789
be used to view contacts dialed numbers

453
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:52,159
read SMS messages now on this one you're

454
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:55,190
gonna see I'm gonna put Volvo devices I

455
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:59,480
was not able to find a vulnerable device

456
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:02,419
for this particular one this particular

457
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,250
captions here's command and options will

458
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:06,409
display the first twenty contacts in the

459
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,679
address book and you can change that you

460
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:12,380
can put one through 100 you can put 20

461
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,789
through 41 if you wanted to kind of

462
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:18,440
cycle through do different things with

463
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:20,899
it you will need to use the SDB SDP tool

464
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,519
browse to find that channel like I was

465
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:25,549
mentioning earlier because you're going

466
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:27,200
to either channel for this personally

467
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,210
like I said here at the bottom I've not

468
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,679
found devices vulnerable to it if

469
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,330
anybody knows they have one that's

470
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,399
vulnerable to it and wants to learn it

471
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,260
out to me you know of course nothing

472
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,939
that is vital to you I don't want your

473
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,940
regular cell phone nothing with your

474
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,440
data own it personal data unless you

475
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,870
want they give me your personal data

476
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,090
I'll take it

477
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:51,799
so BT scanner so this is a terminal

478
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:52,879
based GUI for doing recon I'm not really

479
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,370
a fan of this one

480
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,659
you know maybe back in the day when I

481
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,080
first started messing around with stuff

482
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:59,510
like this

483
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,539
these things are always first appeal to

484
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:04,190
me and I think that was kind of that

485
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:05,990
would mess with my head was I'm like oh

486
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,929
cool it's the goobie I'm a noobs I'm

487
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:10,130
he's a GUI and didn't I would kind of

488
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,649
get disappointed cuz I'm like I don't

489
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:18,529
know what to do here it's not like any

490
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:20,360
other girl we've ever seen before and so

491
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:23,299
I felt like I was getting better in

492
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:27,320
quicker results using blue log and using

493
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:28,970
the HCI tool scan come in still give it

494
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,470
a try because you might find it might

495
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:34,600
work better for you might work better on

496
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,600
your devices you might enjoy it better

497
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,000
everybody's got their own thing right so

498
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:42,280
Red Fang so this is you define non

499
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,230
discoverable Bluetooth devices by brute

500
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:49,690
forcing the last six bytes of the MAC

501
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:53,770
address Fame - ill this option will show

502
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:55,720
device manufacturer codes now when I was

503
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:58,299
doing this there list that they had out

504
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,789
there it was a very short list it just

505
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:02,530
had you know some popular device

506
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:04,299
manufacturers out there and not even

507
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:08,200
some of the more popular ones that are

508
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:12,100
going to be used nowadays so hit the

509
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,750
internet Google do a mac mac address Mac

510
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:22,570
vendor look up that way you can find it

511
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:25,030
all right so fame - or putting your

512
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:28,658
address those commands there this will

513
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:31,059
scan the specified MAC address range and

514
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:34,210
then save the results to the desktop in

515
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:36,970
a log file so what I found in doing this

516
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:40,030
is if I was doing a range of a hundred

517
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:42,909
and thirty-third and 138 MAC addresses

518
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:45,610
and it was going to take between 15 to

519
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:47,320
20 minutes I did that a couple of times

520
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:51,549
and it seemed to always be the same

521
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:54,789
thing I didn't find any hidden devices

522
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:56,470
when I did this but there just weren't

523
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:57,640
really any around and maybe I should

524
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,980
have gone a little bit further and tried

525
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,919
to hide devices maybe I was feeling lazy

526
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,260
that day maybe that particular tool was

527
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,190
done like last week when I did the test

528
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,640
I don't know

529
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,280
so spoof tooth so this is an automated

530
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,159
tool for clothing or spoofing and

531
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,408
Bluetooth devices so this was pretty

532
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,020
cool because yes there's manual ways

533
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:21,760
that you can clone or spoof a device

534
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,629
right you can change your stuff there's

535
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,950
many ways to do it but this is automated

536
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:30,490
right this particular command that I've

537
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,740
got here this one will generate a random

538
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,110
name and address and just put it right

539
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,549
on the interface you specify right

540
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,289
that's pretty cool it does it for you

541
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:41,350
you don't have to try to generate a

542
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:42,700
random one up here in your head then

543
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,399
this other command here spoo tooth

544
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,270
that's off your interface and - yes this

545
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,730
will scan devices with and range

546
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:53,220
right and then it'll give you a list

547
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,020
with numbers and you just pick which one

548
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,550
that you want to climb and it'll clone

549
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,830
that for you automatically

550
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,059
all right so as you imagine this would

551
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,800
be great if you want to do a

552
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:05,129
man-in-the-middle attacks or if you just

553
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:07,700
wanted to do scans from a MAC address

554
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:11,220
that's not actually your MAC address I

555
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:13,320
don't know why you'd want to do that all

556
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,780
right so the uber tooth one and the one

557
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,409
or two so we're quit just want to speak

558
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,730
on did the big difference between these

559
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,290
it's more or less the same device the

560
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,320
one or to thwart is put out by another

561
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,000
company it is the uber tooth one they've

562
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,649
made a few changes what they consider to

563
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,170
be upgrades to it

564
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:35,280
I started out using a 16-0 tooth one and

565
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,170
because of some of the issues I'm going

566
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,420
to talk about here in a minute I said

567
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,790
well the problems that I'm having are

568
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,890
they related just to the device what I

569
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:46,760
have this same problems with a different

570
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,230
device so yeah I've worked out the cache

571
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,330
Witten got another device and decided

572
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,160
with a one or tooth some of it was

573
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,809
because for about maybe five or ten

574
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,870
dollars more than the uber tooth it also

575
00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:04,649
came with an enclosure so installation

576
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:07,260
pain points so I spent hours on two

577
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,929
platforms using a virtual machine and

578
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,090
burn a little laptop and I kept running

579
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:16,050
into different issues all right when I

580
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:19,889
say I spent hours in the VM I seriously

581
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:21,240
created like ten plus VMs right I did

582
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,800
this on purpose this was all in the name

583
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,110
of you guys I wanted to give you all his

584
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,600
much research data in my head and I

585
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:31,830
could see I love you too

586
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,080
I was running into problems in different

587
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,580
spots every single time matter of fact

588
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,740
the first time I went through I actually

589
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,740
got that was like one of the furthest

590
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,929
runs that I got before I actually had

591
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,420
success all the other runs I got stopped

592
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,400
earlier in the process now I'll admit

593
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,650
some of the stops were because I was

594
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,120
doing something very new bright but oh

595
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,370
that's the syntax here but then after it

596
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,340
get past that well it just got stopped

597
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,928
on the next step so I'm not going to go

598
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,340
into all the details about all the

599
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:02,130
actual little problems that I had

600
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:06,840
because they were random problems

601
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:08,550
I got something different spots there is

602
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,459
one particular part that I'm gonna go

603
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:13,350
over here in a second so most all the

604
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:17,280
installation gods that I ran into

605
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:18,840
they were outdated right and you know

606
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,090
that's a common thing right it just

607
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,620
always changes being made so you go look

608
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,530
at the installation God even the ones

609
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,469
out on the the github for the developers

610
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,840
they're always outdated so the big thing

611
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:34,650
is go to the repository and check and

612
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,419
see what the latest version is right use

613
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,370
that instead you just have to change the

614
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,640
path if you're not sure how to use

615
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:44,070
github don't feel bad I still don't know

616
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,400
if I know how to use github a winget I'm

617
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:50,629
being serious you know I'm not a coder

618
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:54,270
or developer whatever you call yourself

619
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:57,030
alright so install it and pass on as

620
00:28:54,270 --> 00:29:02,610
shown in all the gods that I saw it

621
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:05,520
fails right so what worked for me in by

622
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,500
the time people that this video works or

623
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,120
if you decide to go try it this might

624
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,880
fail for you so you might just have to

625
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,459
basically Google how to install pass on

626
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:19,350
but what worked for me is pip install

627
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:21,620
posad - and here's the other funny thing

628
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,030
to worry about these stuffy and outdated

629
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,790
the command they were given was even for

630
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:30,480
posad - it was just for posad however

631
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:32,070
their software now requires posad - so

632
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,540
when i first started this process I

633
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:38,370
could actually use their command to

634
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:40,409
install Python right it was a stolen but

635
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,889
I was getting errors because it wanted

636
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:46,350
poss-eye

637
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:49,170
- Oh My gods really okay so your

638
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:52,879
firmware version and the uber tooth

639
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:55,680
tools need to be the same version so if

640
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,960
if you go and install the latest version

641
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,390
of software for the tools on your laptop

642
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,980
you got to make sure you've got the same

643
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,730
firmware version from those tools

644
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:08,070
updated what I suggest doing and I

645
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:13,560
didn't put it right here directly but if

646
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:15,090
you use that uber tooth util - V right

647
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,009
you can only do this after you in

648
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:20,340
but this will show the current version

649
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:22,860
of firmware in your device so be

650
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,269
prepared because I had a lot of problems

651
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,570
updating firmware I was just determined

652
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:29,549
I was going to make it work don't be too

653
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,678
proud if you're doing this and you

654
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:34,408
cannot get your uber tooth firmware to

655
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,490
update just go find it the same version

656
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:37,889
that's currently on your upper tooth

657
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,570
just to get started right maybe fight

658
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:41,248
that battle a different day don't let it

659
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,230
get you down to the point where you just

660
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:44,999
put your irritates it aside and you

661
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,809
don't do it if you're local to the area

662
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:49,830
or even not local feel free to hit me up

663
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:51,720
right if you're watching this video

664
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:55,039
later do not hit me up I don't want a

665
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,749
million people from the world pinging me

666
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,879
maybe you can hit me up I don't know so

667
00:30:57,749 --> 00:31:02,909
anyway if you're running into problems

668
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:05,369
feel free to reach out to me if I don't

669
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:09,019
respond back that means a million people

670
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:12,090
reached out to me and I exploded so

671
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:14,429
don't even attempt updating this

672
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:16,918
firmware in a VM right if you're

673
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:18,990
familiar with vermiform with VMs there's

674
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,179
a lot of issues when it comes to doing

675
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,700
anything with USB device adapters right

676
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:26,269
you can run it a lot of issues now with

677
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:29,999
the way it works for the uber tooth is

678
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:31,649
it goes into a different mode right so

679
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:35,940
it's kind of like almost you put a

680
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:37,709
second device into your laptop so if you

681
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,110
even want to attempt doing a VM you've

682
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,960
got to create a different filter within

683
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:44,610
Kali so and that's that's not my

684
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,100
cat-lair within the VM that's something

685
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,719
that didn't go into detail here is you

686
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,019
will most likely have to set up filters

687
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,820
for your USB devices with the VirtualBox

688
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:55,649
I'm not expert on doing it but it's not

689
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,360
really hard I mentioned in that and

690
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:58,439
there's other pictures here because I

691
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,779
was able to figure it out quite easily

692
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,529
it's just under settings you just had to

693
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:06,269
add button you get a list to choose from

694
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:08,340
if you're not sure which device that you

695
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:10,980
want to add add a filter for every one

696
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,360
in the list I'm not gonna hurt unless I

697
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,909
put a USB device and you know what type

698
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,039
of me my working look

699
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:20,820
okay so if you don't have a bare-metal

700
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,350
system to install Kali ohm what I found

701
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:26,129
was so when I first did this and was

702
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:29,178
trying to get the uber tooth one that

703
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:32,700
was loaned to me updated and I literally

704
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:35,640
I'm glad I don't have long hair because

705
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,010
I would have pulled it out right if I

706
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:42,080
wasn't going bought already I would be

707
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:44,760
bald now because it was a nightmare I

708
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,918
didn't have a system I could just go and

709
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,789
you know wipe everything out on put Kali

710
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,919
on or put any kind of Linux on to try so

711
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:55,740
I grabbed a USB device let's see if it's

712
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,250
going to work in just a live USB it

713
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,470
worked

714
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,179
that was actually of all the firmware

715
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,830
updates I did that was actually the

716
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:08,010
quickest and most successful firmware

717
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:10,049
update I bleed it right up no problems

718
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,149
not one single issue that was my first

719
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:15,360
big success with the uber tooth journey

720
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:18,989
was updating the firmware using la boot

721
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,860
USB so take that for what you will that

722
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:24,570
does not mean it's going to be

723
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,610
successful for you so if you don't know

724
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:29,220
if you have a Raspberry Pi that also

725
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:33,269
worked for me so when I did the firmware

726
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,880
update I did it a different way I did it

727
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:37,889
using the Raspberry Pi on my Wonder

728
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,990
tooth versus the uber tooth and I did it

729
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:41,428
just to see hey oh yeah I forgot I got a

730
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:45,419
Raspberry Pi sitting over here let's try

731
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:47,880
that alright so the path of no

732
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:49,559
resistance like I said I had a lot a lot

733
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,279
of problems and what I was trying to do

734
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:57,210
was find a path of least resistance the

735
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,970
Raspberry Pi 3 when I first booted that

736
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,649
up stuck the device in started going

737
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,620
through the the tutorials

738
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:06,870
you know the install commands - having

739
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,310
to change the facade - installation

740
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:13,290
process I did not have a single problem

741
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,668
now granted maybe it's just because I'd

742
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:17,879
already filled like a hundred other

743
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:19,770
times previously but I didn't have a

744
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,080
single problem this was the first device

745
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:25,770
I was able to get the uber tooth to work

746
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,639
on I took my family out to Outback

747
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:31,179
Steakhouse to celebrate that night

748
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:33,039
that is not a la my originally did this

749
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:35,168
and my wife's like what's for dinner

750
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:42,839
tonight and I'm like oh we going out

751
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:46,179
back daddy want some coconut shrimp so

752
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:47,288
two quick ways to test the install so

753
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,720
what's this installed you wanna make

754
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:53,940
sure is my device working so you can do

755
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:56,589
the uber tooth slash specs spec in - UI

756
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:00,519
all right you can also do burr tooth are

757
00:34:56,589 --> 00:35:02,109
eggs so the spectrum analyzer when you

758
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:04,749
run that command this is going to pop up

759
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:08,880
right you're gonna see these lines just

760
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:11,348
start going nuts a hundred miles an hour

761
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,380
so if you're seeing that happening you

762
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:15,099
know that it's working something else

763
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,359
you can do

764
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:31,269
oh actually that's me a part of my demo

765
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:38,739
so for the next part wish I had a little

766
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:40,269
holder for this I know right anybody's

767
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:45,160
talkin after me have to deal with the

768
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:59,589
fact this has been impaired you're

769
00:35:45,160 --> 00:36:01,239
welcome oh shoot that's uh you would

770
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:06,989
think that I would have a way to

771
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:06,989
actually clean that up and I don't

772
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:16,769
yeah re-type of it that's the wrong

773
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,769
password

774
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,700
[Music]

775
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:36,260
well I was like wait a minute I've not

776
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:39,129
won all I'm saying is the person that's

777
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:43,700
currently tripping you up will be oh

778
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:45,619
damn it we will be hanging out and

779
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:53,118
drinking together later so if somebody

780
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:55,630
has a shady no I wouldn't do that Dave's

781
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,630
not here man

782
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:01,760
all right so we'll claim that as my demo

783
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:04,569
failure for the night right so now that

784
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,300
demo guys can be nice to me

785
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:10,400
okay so this just a quick short demo to

786
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:14,270
show what happens when you run the uber

787
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:18,109
tooth rx come in it's nothing fancy I

788
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:20,150
just I discovered this neat little I'm

789
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:24,170
how to say that I see I see in cinema

790
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:25,579
I see whatever ASCII Simha I was like

791
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:29,720
hey this thing is kind of cool so I'm

792
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:31,880
just gonna use it a few times so once

793
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,770
you start seeing this pop up this is

794
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,890
another song that your uber tooth is

795
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:39,319
working right it's not that much to it

796
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,509
it's just going through this is actually

797
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:43,460
looking for the lap or the lower address

798
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,170
part this is one way you can achieve

799
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,630
that you can use it for some of the

800
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,970
other attacks or things that you can do

801
00:37:47,630 --> 00:38:03,470
within the uber tooth or you can also

802
00:37:49,970 --> 00:38:12,799
use it for other Cali tools I better

803
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:16,040
hurry the hell up huh okay so now to

804
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,050
capture package this is you know the

805
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,579
reason why I got into the uber tooth is

806
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,460
everybody's like hey this is how you can

807
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:24,940
capture Bluetooth packets alright so

808
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,530
this the main thing I wanted to do here

809
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,770
this come in here in bur tooth blah de

810
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:32,450
blah de blah so

811
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:35,180
it's used a sniff for the Bluetooth

812
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:38,960
low-energy packets in promiscuous mode

813
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,299
and then save it to a pcap file right so

814
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,270
there are three flags for capturing

815
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:47,090
packets to a peek at file the - R -

816
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,980
queue and - see you want to experiment

817
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,720
with these see what might work best for

818
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,400
yourself or for the devices that you're

819
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,750
currently doing at the time was like the

820
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,900
scans that your is information you're

821
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,850
looking for

822
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:50,030
all right so that being said hang on I

823
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:52,060
actually got another little demo all

824
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,650
right so using that same command here

825
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:58,520
and what you're seeing right now these

826
00:39:54,650 --> 00:40:00,080
are packets so the uber tooth were in

827
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,240
this case I was actually using my Wonder

828
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,380
tooth the Wonder tooth was going through

829
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,100
and it was actually capturing these

830
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,960
packets while this was going on it was

831
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,310
creating a peek at file I promise you

832
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,550
y'all so this was a timid I'm not

833
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:18,200
capturing package right now and the

834
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:20,840
reason I mentioned that is because this

835
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,710
is the PCAT file that was created during

836
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:26,630
this so I'm just going to open this

837
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,010
we can wash or work I'm not going to try

838
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:30,530
to explain anything that's in these

839
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:35,990
files mainly because I'm also a wire

840
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:39,200
short noob right I just want to show

841
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:44,618
like hey I did actually have success I

842
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,799
capture packets there's some information

843
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:50,390
something

844
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:52,880
something blue sod all right so we got a

845
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:57,290
peek at file right now at this point in

846
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,569
time you really lose me meaning I don't

847
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:02,210
know this yet this is something that I'm

848
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:03,890
working towards so one thing I wanted

849
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,170
I'm hoping to achieve with this talk if

850
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:08,240
I get a good response is I want to turn

851
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:10,730
this into a series I want to keep going

852
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,529
further down the Bluetooth hole right

853
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:14,750
I'm pushing myself to start you know

854
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:17,420
let's go a bit further let's learn more

855
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:19,400
so anybody here tonight that's an expert

856
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,280
on easiest stuff that you're like yeah

857
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,920
you need to do better here please come

858
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,380
talk to me you know I'd love to sit down

859
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,720
and chat with people learn a little bit

860
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,970
more about it because I do what I'm we

861
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:45,730
do more talks I do want to get more

862
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:45,730
advanced with this okay so any questions

863
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:57,078
it's a great question you do not

864
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,930
necessarily have to use an adapter

865
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:01,190
however if you're doing it in a VM you

866
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,578
will need an adapter for it

867
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:07,339
from what I found and well my research

868
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:09,140
that was a combination of you know just

869
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:11,240
verifying that everybody else says yeah

870
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,750
you need it and then also I've tried it

871
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,180
myself

872
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:19,369
right with the VM is just not going to

873
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:22,098
pick up your your internal adapter or

874
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:24,650
your internal bluetooth so for the for

875
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:27,980
Kali you will need or Kali at a

876
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:30,740
VirtualBox VM machine virtual machine

877
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:33,049
whatever you will need an adapter for

878
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,808
that if you're doing it on a bare metal

879
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:38,270
system you will not so you solving the

880
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:41,000
demo here earlier if you might

881
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:44,180
when I did the ACI config command it

882
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,490
should have found two interfaces right

883
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:52,220
one was the embedded and the other was

884
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:54,890
the adapter now what I found on the bare

885
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,990
metal system that was awesome we donated

886
00:42:54,890 --> 00:43:02,259
to me so I'm not gonna complain too much

887
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:05,180
about it that Bluetooth adapter sucked

888
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:07,070
like it didn't see stuff when I

889
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,720
literally put it on top of the laptop

890
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:12,280
every now that it would pick it up and

891
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,689
I'm like yeah this is no bueno

892
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,520
so that's when I went out and I got the

893
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,470
the particular of adapter that I did

894
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,060
don't take that to heart

895
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,980
don't say hey I gotta go get the same

896
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:24,799
thing fomat had there are better

897
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,710
adapters out there I was in a pinch that

898
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,690
one I got that one because all the

899
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:32,270
reviews said this definitely works for

900
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,470
Kali right I want to make sure I could

901
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,900
get something to work with Kali so I'm

902
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:43,549
not delaying my researching further so

903
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:46,580
is that that good right yes I did and I

904
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:49,150
had the same amount of problems that was

905
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:51,200
actually a thank you for asking that

906
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:54,109
that was one of the first things that I

907
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,790
did I had a problem with VirtualBox so I

908
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:58,310
was like okay let me try it in VMware

909
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:01,220
now disclaimer the VMware was the free

910
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,810
version of VMware Workstation player I

911
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,029
don't know if that would work any

912
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:07,430
different as you go to I know a lot of

913
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:11,410
people have licenses for the much nicer

914
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:11,410
versions maybe you have better success

915
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:24,120
any more questions

916
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:31,620
yes what was the

917
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:33,029
very last three words you said if you're

918
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,680
thinking the answer to that is yes that

919
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,280
means you understood at peak Apfel

920
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,279
better than I do

921
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:44,990
so yeah and yeah you can't do both

922
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:47,130
Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy yeah

923
00:44:44,990 --> 00:45:20,279
all right and now somebody outside hand

924
00:44:47,130 --> 00:45:22,890
up over here the yes I'm gonna say that

925
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,050
personally I found much more success

926
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:28,080
with using the adapter of regardless of

927
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:31,470
which one it was in because like I said

928
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,420
mop the bare metal that I had that

929
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,850
Bluetooth that was sucked it really did

930
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,800
I get this anything so I can't compare

931
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:40,620
that if I had a system where it was

932
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,560
actually working correctly so I'm gonna

933
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:46,080
say my personal experience was adapter

934
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,460
all the way now and these adapters are

935
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,430
not expensive regular boots with

936
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,740
adapters you can find them 10 to $15 all

937
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:55,859
day long you know if you wanted to you

938
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:57,839
blow 30 bucks on one sure but even that

939
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,400
I mean yeah it can be expensive for some

940
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,440
people with 30 bucks it's a it's a

941
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:18,570
manageable thing all right all right

942
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:19,830
more questions no yes yeah I'm trying to

943
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:26,570
make sure I understand what you're

944
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:26,569
asking me okay

945
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,569
right and well and the reason for that

946
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,660
is they actually made a change within

947
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:39,640
their their tools so if you wanted to

948
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,710
work with the original posad you would

949
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,990
need to use a younger version or earlier

950
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:45,490
version of the uber tooth tools there's

951
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:48,490
actually something that the developers

952
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:50,470
did rather is intentional or not where

953
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:56,310
you know hey it's now it's got to have

954
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:56,310
pasa - yes
