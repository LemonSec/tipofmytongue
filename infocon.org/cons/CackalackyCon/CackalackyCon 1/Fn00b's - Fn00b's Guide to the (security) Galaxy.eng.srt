much alright alright so before I even

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,670
start I want to say thank you to all the

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,279
people that have made it out here

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,050
tonight all the encouraging messages

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,759
I've received over the last few months

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,529
and the people that have traveled from

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,350
afar to make sure they were here to hear

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,059
this special thanks to the security

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,770
community all around the country but

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,019
especially the community right here in

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,660
the Research Triangle the amount of

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,030
encouragement and camaraderie is like no

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,319
other that I've ever experienced if it

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,570
wasn't for them I wouldn't be standing

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,430
up here and it's truly where I found my

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,430
home and family so thank you all a

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:02,250
couple years ago I was sitting down at

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,518
my first capture the flag event oh yes

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,280
you were all I had was a laptop with

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,420
Kali Linux installed sitting next to me

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,040
was Peter Hewitt

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,689
I don't know if he's here today but if

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,820
you don't know him you really should if

27
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,298
you see me at an event and Pete's around

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,850
all he'll I'll be happy to introduce you

29
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:22,890
anyway at the CTF I was so excited to be

30
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,798
there but also had no clue what I was

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,720
getting myself into he suggested I come

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,720
up with a Twitter handle because all the

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,759
cool kids were doing it well I figured I

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,679
would eventually get to that soon but I

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,689
needed to go ahead and register for the

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,540
CTF so that I could hop on to the

37
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,220
learners section and follow along as I

38
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,560
was registering I filled out the usual

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,649
information team name team password

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,140
email address after I registered the

41
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,740
team I needed a lot to log into the site

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,020
to play so here I was so excited to play

43
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,548
that when I went to log in I totally had

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,780
forgotten the password that I just

45
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,969
created 30 seconds ago well lucky for me

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,380
there was a password reset option so I

47
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,229
clicked that and entered my email

48
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,228
address and after I hit submit the next

49
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,870
page loaded wait that wasn't supposed to

50
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,710
happen what I saw was a full page of

51
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,300
code and with

52
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,170
that code my little noobish brain

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:22,530
understood exactly what happened jackpot

54
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,970
I'm at a CTF the server running the

55
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,340
whole thing was left in verbose

56
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,910
debugging mode and I just got the admin

57
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,840
username and password in clear text

58
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,940
right on the screen in front of me

59
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:41,310
hell I didn't even have to check my

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:43,770
email that was so easy even an ephah

61
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,450
noob could do it the eff noob that was

62
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,100
me before I get too deep into my talk I

63
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,500
want to preface by saying these are all

64
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,359
my own opinions not those of my employer

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,610
or any other group that I may be

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,320
involved with I also mention resources

67
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,570
in here but it doesn't mean that I'm

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,730
endorsing them their product or their

69
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:07,859
services I'm just simply stating they

70
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:09,390
may be an option for you one of the best

71
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,840
thoughts I've ever seen was by Brian

72
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,339
Austin at besides Charleston in 2017 and

73
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,920
it was geared towards newbies in

74
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,970
security and at the time I was really

75
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,820
really green everything to me was really

76
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,070
exciting and I was essentially lost not

77
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,260
sure where to start what resources were

78
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,510
available or how to even break into

79
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,019
security I just knew that I really

80
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,850
really wanted to work in security from

81
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,560
that talk I gained a list of valuable

82
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,079
resources that ultimately helped me

83
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,640
learn gain experience network and

84
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,510
finally break into security

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,730
professionally in 2011 I was given the

86
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,739
great opportunity to launch into IT with

87
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,690
the Department of Defense I became the

88
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,350
lead IT support for the headquarters of

89
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,970
Fort pulk

90
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,310
and the print server administrator for

91
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:01,170
the whole installation I started out

92
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:03,930
with no formal training only a passion

93
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,459
for technology and for learning I'm now

94
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,370
a security engineer and subject matter

95
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,620
expert in many different areas within IT

96
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,600
I have several IT and security

97
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,800
certifications and also a degree and all

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,350
of those were achieved while working

99
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,690
full time oftentimes of very demanding

100
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:23,400
roles some of the information today will

101
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,210
be general advice based on my own

102
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,000
experiment

103
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,359
excuse me experience what I did and how

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,060
I

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
into security but I also have a website

106
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,710
that my wonderful partner has helped me

107
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,370
build and while the site is only in its

108
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,049
infancy

109
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,419
I hope to build it with something much

110
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,289
greater while also keeping it simple and

111
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,539
easy to use

112
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:44,430
the idea here is to share information

113
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:46,318
about the best resources available in

114
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,300
order to help build up and bring more

115
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:53,340
people into our community by giving them

116
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,599
a starting point so you're interested in

117
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,818
security but you aren't sure where to

118
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,500
start or maybe you've been in security

119
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,159
for a while but you're looking for

120
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,919
something now if possible I'd suggest to

121
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:07,020
narrow it down what did it what is it

122
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,779
that you liked to do that was really

123
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,979
hard for me and it still is hard for me

124
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,969
I want to learn it all if you aren't

125
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,729
sure what to do

126
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:20,000
are sure what you like start off by

127
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,080
crossing things off that you don't like

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,729
ultimately life's too short to spend

129
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,279
majority of it doing something that you

130
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:27,810
aren't interested in or something that's

131
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,610
not going to lead you to doing something

132
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,120
that you do like so pick something that

133
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,889
you like and then pursue it some

134
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,389
questions that you can ask yourself can

135
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:41,000
narrow down what you like are you

136
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:43,349
interested in planning and designing

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,029
consider architect or engineering roles

138
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,310
or are you more interested in

139
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:51,349
investigating and analyzing consider

140
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:54,000
Incident Response or analyst roles as

141
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:55,620
you navigate through the security galaxy

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,689
it is important to stay focused on your

143
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,339
ultimate goal there will be a lot of

144
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:01,349
distracting things that will be so

145
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,419
interesting but may send you down a

146
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,310
rabbit hole in some other direction that

147
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,169
takes you away from achieving your goal

148
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,849
I'm still a newb

149
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,729
which means everything is still bright

150
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,800
and shiny and exciting to me and truly

151
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:18,449
this field is a breeding ground for the

152
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,210
curious and I'm curious for instance

153
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,729
last year I may have turned off the fire

154
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,150
display in the middle of the lobby of

155
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:29,039
that other conference because I may have

156
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,810
been curious on what that switch that

157
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,849
was not protected in any way and just

158
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,669
out there in the open would do

159
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:37,500
I may have exploited an open foreigner

160
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:40,049
ability because I may have been able to

161
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,980
and while I wouldn't suggest exploiting

162
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,030
vulnerabilities

163
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,420
unless you have the legal authorization

164
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:47,010
to do so it's the curiosity to look for

165
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,070
unlock doors that can really help you

166
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,349
succeed in security another member in

167
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:55,230
the community pulled me aside later to

168
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,710
mention that I fit right in just because

169
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,390
of that and I'm not condoning any

170
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,799
illegal activity here just pointing out

171
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,510
that part of our job as security

172
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,640
professionals is to find those unlock

173
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,560
doors to figure out where they go to see

174
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,570
if there are any other new areas that

175
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,720
you can get to from that point and then

176
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,230
to also yell at IT for not locking them

177
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,230
to begin with

178
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,640
after you figured out what you're

179
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,349
interested in what are the next steps my

180
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,659
first suggestion is to get as much

181
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:27,120
training as you can do as you can and

182
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,910
the very thing that you want to do there

183
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,180
are resources for every job in security

184
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,640
there are videos courses books blogs and

185
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,140
Twitter feeds full of rants regarding

186
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,140
whatever subject you're interested in

187
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:47,750
you can search YouTube conference talks

188
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,340
checkouts and cyber area CBT Nuggets

189
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,950
some offer free access to training

190
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,530
others are paid by training or

191
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:57,990
subscriptions to their whole platform I

192
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,250
personally have been lucky to win some

193
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,050
training through conferences I've

194
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,050
attended or even through shared accounts

195
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,550
with friends I very much understand what

196
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,960
it's like to be strapped for cash and

197
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,760
everywhere you look for security

198
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,039
training seems to cost thousands of

199
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,020
dollars and to me that's just a bit

200
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,600
unattainable for those that are just

201
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,390
starting but luckily there are some free

202
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,370
solutions there's also a nice community

203
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,320
of people always offering hands-on

204
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,970
training but I'll get to that in the

205
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,030
networking collaboration part of this

206
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,640
talk alongside your training I'd suggest

207
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,830
building a lab build a lab to practice

208
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,409
in your own environment you can easily

209
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,909
build a virtual lab or a physical lab it

210
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,799
really just depends on what type of

211
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,659
training you're looking for and it

212
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,209
doesn't have to be expensive in fact you

213
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,159
can build virtual labs for free you can

214
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,560
easily create a pen testing environment

215
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,880
with VMware Workstation player a Windows

216
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,109
XP image and a Kali Linux image I

217
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,060
personally really wanted to understand

218
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,310
networking and routing better and one

219
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,410
a physical lab so I went out there about

220
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,849
several Cisco switches a router and an

221
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,329
access point so that I could really

222
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,100
study the Cisco IOS I also asked for

223
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,810
these types of parts for birthdays and

224
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,970
other holidays as well to help keep my

225
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:14,130
own cost down it was a good it was good

226
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,110
because in a way it also allowed me to

227
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,570
allow my family and friends to help

228
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,310
invest in my dreams and it's not a bad

229
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,930
idea to ask others to help in this way

230
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,699
it may mean that you don't get the

231
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,529
latest gaming console console for your

232
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:30,210
birthday but ultimately it's a direct

233
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:32,970
investment into you I really wanted to

234
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,560
keep I really wanted to get deep in the

235
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,060
command-line interface and tinker and

236
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,529
there are some virtual ways to do this

237
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,300
as well without needing to buy equipment

238
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:41,760
but I didn't want some of the

239
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,219
limitations I also really wanted to have

240
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,680
a nice cabinet with my IT equipment the

241
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,390
last part hasn't happened yet and for

242
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,949
the longest time the switches shared my

243
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,569
desk and I would just put my headphones

244
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,930
on to drown out the noise of all the

245
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,210
fans anyway the point of the lab it's a

246
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,640
tinkerer here you can build and break

247
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,830
and then build and break again build out

248
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,930
environments click all the buttons try

249
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,720
all the options really learn the ins and

250
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,250
outs of the tools you're using the best

251
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,530
learning comes from really needing to

252
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,290
figure out why something stopped working

253
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,900
after you broke it so that's what that

254
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,520
option does with a lab there's endless

255
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,670
opportunities to do this without

256
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,900
pressure or your job being on the line

257
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,760
if you decide that you don't want to

258
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,010
build a lab there's plenty of other

259
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,720
options hack the box and hack the side

260
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,000
are examples of sites that give you pen

261
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,800
testing challenges for free of course

262
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
sans an offensive offensive security

263
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,550
come to mind when I think of lab

264
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,360
environments that cost money and they're

265
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,849
not cheap but they have premium training

266
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,890
other sites are coming along too and by

267
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,959
all means this is not an exhaustive list

268
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,209
of resources but I do hope to continue

269
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,530
gathering information so feel free to

270
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,329
share what you know and I'll be sure to

271
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,439
pass the information on and add it to

272
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:57,300
the website there's also that lovely

273
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
conversation regarding education and

274
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,939
certifications or as some would say

275
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,170
education versus certifications

276
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,060
education and certifications are

277
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,079
important but they only truly get you so

278
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,030
far and while I'm not speaking

279
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,400
for all institutions from my own

280
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,860
experience I found that formal education

281
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,870
in the form of a university are often

282
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,120
years behind the current trends and

283
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,750
technologies and the curriculum may not

284
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,310
be as valuable as it could be certainly

285
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,050
we have some of the best universities

286
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,849
locally and I would hope that's not the

287
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,599
case here I'm only speaking from my own

288
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,240
experience on the other hand

289
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,040
certifications are only as worth as much

290
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,140
as he put into them if you actually

291
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,880
study to learn the material and not just

292
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,410
pass the test they often will the most

293
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,230
relevant and useful information

294
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,400
regarding the subject another option is

295
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,220
to take courses that give you

296
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,959
certifications once you pass their exams

297
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,730
sans for instance has many courses that

298
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,240
they offer as well as offensive security

299
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,800
ec-council and many more there's really

300
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,290
a sweet spot in there somewhere between

301
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,849
some education and some certifications

302
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,829
and depending on the role you're aiming

303
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,240
for it could actually be a requirement

304
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,060
to have both education and

305
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,790
certifications and not so much an option

306
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,199
for you there are a lot of companies

307
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,569
that have thrown the college education

308
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,820
requirement right out the window Google

309
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:21,040
Apple IBM and become American are

310
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:23,080
examples networking collaboration is the

311
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,240
next big thing go to events in the

312
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,700
community join a meet-up go to a

313
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,150
conference talk to people get on their

314
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,520
slack channel just don't be annoying dee

315
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,709
c919 meets once a month majority of the

316
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,120
time has a three or four hour hands-on

317
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,510
training session regarding various

318
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,640
subjects within security Raleigh Issa

319
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,790
also meets once a month and has training

320
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:51,550
sessions multiple times a month RTP SEC

321
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:54,240
beers oak City Lock sport and 2600 are

322
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,160
also good groups for networking

323
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,410
there's also annual conferences in this

324
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,030
area obviously the one you're at is one

325
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,660
event but there are others like besides

326
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,370
r2u and triumph triangle Infoseek on

327
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,949
having people in the community that know

328
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,560
you and like you is pretty big step for

329
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,510
finding a job the security community is

330
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,969
really small and we're pretty close-knit

331
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,920
it's not beyond our ability to ask

332
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,700
people if they know someone particular

333

or if anyone knows any job openings

334
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,180

338
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,920
to build a circle of allies around you

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,380
of social media I know some of you are

351
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,030
totally against social media but I'm

352
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,370
here to also tell you that it can be

353
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,020
used as a tool used wisely you can

354
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,060
create your own persona online that

355
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,939
emphasizes your passion for security or

356
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,939
even to just say hey I was here and I

357
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,890
did a security thing you can also say

358
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,960
hey here's my documented proof that

359
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,520
while I may not have all the experience

360
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,380
you're asking for in your job

361
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,880
description I definitely have been

362
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,100
actively a part of the security

363
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,840
community on my own free time as you can

364
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,430
tell by my social media check that

365
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,970
you're gonna do when you consider me for

366
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:40,449
this role which leads me to the next

367
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,260
area once you've figured out what you're

368
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,660
interested in

369
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,340
studied built a lab your certification

370
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,500
exam networked with the community

371
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,690
collaborated and have a social media

372
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:54,550
presence it's time to consider applying

373
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:56,800
for a job or a new one while considering

374
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,510
roles I'd like to also mention that the

375
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,430
culture of the employer also really

376
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,290
matters and I recommend researching it

377
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,089
are they focused on training do they

378
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,219
offer training vouchers do they

379
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,620
reimburse you for training do they allow

380
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:12,810
you to work from home how big is the

381
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:15,660
team can you bring your dog to work I

382
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,160
can and it's awesome

383
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,640
you have to figure out what environment

384
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,560
works best for you and what you value

385
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,939
also think about whether you are

386
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,920
interested in learning more than just

387
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,960
your main role or if you would prefer to

388
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,540
work in a position that has just a

389
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,580
couple main responsibilities some people

390
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,110
work better in siloed type environments

391
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,050
while others are more eager to learn and

392
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,890
to expand into as many areas as possible

393
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:44,199
I didn't start with a security engineer

394
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,449
title from the get-go remember I started

395
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,550
with no formal training in IT whatsoever

396
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,770
just the passion I had inside of me from

397
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,680
the first time I ever laid eyes on a

398
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,870
motherboard in the last eight years I've

399
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,729
worked on the helpdesk built a help desk

400
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,830
ran the print server learned the ins and

401
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,930
outs of Active Directory office 365

402
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,730
learned how to run scripts use

403
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,010
PowerShell implemented hardening

404
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,930
procedures push for tougher security in

405
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,290
my own environments and worked alongside

406
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,489
every security team that I could

407
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,829
security has always been a big part of

408
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,200
my role no matter what my title was and

409
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:20,770
that's important to remember and also to

410
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,780
mention on your resume I used to live in

411
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,250
Goldsboro which is about an hour and a

412
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,890
half from here and I drove out here

413
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:30,520
regularly to attend meetups conferences

414
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:33,130
and sometimes multiple times a week I've

415
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,560
attended almost every local and regional

416
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:37,630
security conference from Georgia Georgia

417
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,760
to Washington DC in the last few years

418
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,189
and have volunteered at several of them

419
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,510
so here's a quick shout-out as well to

420
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,460
all the people in all the different

421
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,770
communities that create and manage these

422
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:52,300
events and all the other volunteers that

423
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:53,829
helped make them run eventually I found

424
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,560
a way to a company that would consider

425
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:59,470
me for a security role after I finished

426
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,020
the big project they hired me for I knew

427
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,820
what I wanted prior to taking the role

428
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,650
so when they got around to considering

429
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,990
people for the security engineer role I

430
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:13,450
pestered them because I knew what I

431
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:15,339
wanted and I felt I had paid my dues I'd

432
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,810
also like to mention too that stem is

433
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:20,109
important in our communities in schools

434
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:22,179
as a kid I was curious I mean I think we

435
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:23,829
all were I remember the first time my

436
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,660
father brought home this weird boxy

437
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:28,208
machine - had letters in a really small

438
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,750
green screen I asked him what it was and

439
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,200
he said

440
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:34,809
it was a laptop what's a laptop how does

441
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,400
it work in second grade they took us

442
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,049
through the library on a field trip and

443
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,830
I remember that day because it changed

444
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:44,200
my life the library had was having a

445
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,059
computer day event on the tables they

446
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,620
had open computers with motherboards on

447
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:52,000
display and I should you not I thought

448
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,979
this was so awesome I looked at those

449
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,380
motherboards and my curiously

450
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,929
imaginative brain started going down an

451
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:03,220
adventure that has just not stopped even

452
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:05,049
to this very day to six-year-old me the

453
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,450
transistors and resistors were like

454
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:11,049
little buildings and the traces were the

455
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:16,090
roads the fan was a stadium this was the

456
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:17,799
coolest micro machine city ever I wanted

457
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,240
to know how it worked I wanted to know

458
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,700
why it worked I asked the million

459
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,610
questions and I still do so here I am

460
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,919
my passion for IT was embedded into me

461
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,199
right then and there six years old some

462
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,289
of the best ways to learn is really to

463
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,360
teach and children will ask a million

464
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:38,940
questions because they are so curious

465
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:41,830
and curiosity is perfect for this field

466
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,840
finally if there's anything I've learned

467
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,460
in the eight years of working on NIT

468
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,039
it's this technology moves quickly keep

469
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,110
learning to stay relevant office

470
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,480
politics play a big role in decisions so

471
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,100
don't take them personally and no they

472
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,690
have not tried to turn it off and then

473
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,850
on again on the more personal topic

474
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,150
about being a woman in IT there's a few

475
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,389
things that I'd like to say sit at the

476
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:13,169
table because your presence matters

477
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,669
speak up because your ideas are valuable

478
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:17,770
don't take any from anyone because

479
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:19,480
you're deserving of respect and if you

480
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,070
have to take their only do so

481
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:29,670
strategically and then go to HR

482
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:32,159
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but

483
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,350
you're gonna spend more time with your

484
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,540
co-workers than your own family and you

485
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,060
deserve a happy life so draw a line and

486
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,879
don't take that if HR does nothing

487
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,220
find somewhere else to work because the

488
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,090
company has issues fundamentally and you

489
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:50,340
are not a pawn recognize your allies

490
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,620
there are wonderful men and women both

491
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,689
in and outside of IT that will be

492
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,820
inspired by your persistent nature to

493
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,850
continue pushing forward and will always

494
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,040
be in your corner you are not alone a

495
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,389
whole army of women with an IT and

496
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,520
security have their own crazy

497
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,260
experiences and there are several groups

498
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,129
like women and security and privacy to

499
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,800
prove that and lastly on the subject of

500
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:17,190
being a woman in security I really

501
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,350
really want to wait in line at local and

502
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:23,130
regional security conferences to use the

503
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:25,560
women's bathroom it would truly make me

504
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,300
happy to see more women involved and

505
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,280
while the bathroom visits are

506
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,080
streamlined currently I have big hopes

507
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,020
that we can get more women involved and

508
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:38,879
that we two eventually will have to wait

509
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:41,100
in lines alongside my talk tonight we

510
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:46,170
have launched my website F new comm that

511
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:48,270
is F n00b comm as I stated earlier the

512
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,620
website is in its infancy but the goal

513
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,750
is to build it out to be a major

514
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,379
resource in place for noobs and

515

522
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,180
part of this profession because it means

523
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,810
that I'm continuously pushing myself to

524
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,300

noob I'm here to ask you to pat yourself

529

that you are trying something new and in

531
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,930
