14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,950
[Applause]

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,899
so yes if if you haven't met me I've

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,090
been to a lumber of cackalacky cons in

17
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,699
the past I do covert entry work I do

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,250
physical entry work my team and I break

19
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,050
into places that's what we do we get

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,109
places we're not supposed to be and it

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,059
is a fun job it is a really good time if

22
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,309
you can get the work by all means try it

23
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,780
because you know like I don't belong in

24
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,729
there I'm gonna hurt something in there

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,380
I shouldn't be in there at all but

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,920
that's a--that's an entire liability

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,600
situation way worse than anything here

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,340
now when people think about you know

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,869
what I do and they talk to me a lot and

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,159
if you've been with Patrick and the rest

31
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,229
of the crew and the lot who spend a lot

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,030
big room locking villages yes that's

33
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,289
like all the hands solid how'd you all

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,780
fit so yes lock-picking is fun and I

35
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,420
talk a lot about lock-picking and I talk

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,159
a lot about how locks work now we're not

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,600
gonna do any lock picking today but it's

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,909
important to remember a few things

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,710
because there's there's a number of ways

40
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,960
that we get into buildings and get into

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,839
secured spaces and lock-picking is

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,130
seldom among them so you have a key

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,869
right here's a key and it's got all

44
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,210
these cuts those are called bidding cuts

45
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,610
and if the bidding is correct okay the

46
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,579
key will open the lock now regarding

47
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,640
those bidding cuts a key it's not like

48
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,029
there's infinite range of like potential

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,950
cuts there are a number of discrete

50
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,140
manufacturers specified bidding depths

51
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,360
and if depending on what the depth is

52
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,489
right like it will or will not work but

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,270
being able to figure out what those

54
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,640
bidding depths are it

55
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,740
means there there's not an infinite

56
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,709
number of possibilities you have a

57
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,770
number of very specific targets and if

58
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:26,590
you can recreate those cuts you can make

59
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,140
a key that will work now for example if

60
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,460
you have access to locksmithing software

61
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,130
and we're playing with this for a few

62
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,080
minutes downstairs earlier this is a

63
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,480
this is the quick set like bidding chart

64
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,000
right there's only seven potential cut

65
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,160
values really six most of the time but

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,450
if you know those cut values if you have

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,970
access to a little bit of information

68
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,790
about the key you could recreate that

69
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,490
key and we do that a lot on jobs now the

70
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,220
best case scenario for this is if you've

71
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,380
ever been issued a key even briefly like

72
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,780
officially like you hi I'm here from

73
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,730
copier I got a refill your headlight

74
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,530
fluid in your Xerox like fine like

75
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,119
someone gives you a key for a second or

76
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,830
if you break into the Security office

77
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,300
and for like a minute you get the wafer

78
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,400
lock open on the key cabinet you steal a

79
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,380
key and it's physically in your hand

80
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,350
there's a few things you can do at that

81
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,570
point we talked about bidding depths

82
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,890
right so if you have calipers and these

83
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,750
are by the way like the cheapest

84
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,160
calipers on Amazon if you want to just

85
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,380
get a beter set that you throw in your

86
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,750
bag and don't care about so if you take

87
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,730
calipers to a key and this is clearly

88
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,290
not a quick set key right this is an

89
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,690
odd-shaped head what is this well this

90
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,730
is a sergeant brand key well we happen

91
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,100
to have you know sergeant in our

92
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,049
locksmithing software here we have the

93
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,930
key chart for sergeant well if you know

94
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,120
the depths and if you can look at those

95
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,760
and if you can slap a key into some

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,110
calipers you can absolutely decode a key

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,399
this way in fact we're going to do this

98
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,850
together if you don't understand what I

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,860
mean

100
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,049
we're way up here we're choked up right

101
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,690
near the head of the key we're on the

102
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,760
first bidding position and this this

103
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,070
caliper is reading oh three oh actually

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,859
oh three eight okay so we look at our

105
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,019
chart up here what bidding depth is this

106
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,290
first position right that looks like a

107
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,790
two to me oh three it perfect alright

108
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,829
what's the next position look like to

109
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,390
you

110
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,760
two-seven-five what is it yeah that's a

111
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,019
depth of three the next position looks

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,730
pretty damn similar to me what do you

113
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:23,620
think yeah I'd call that a three now

114
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,210
yeah we're back at two we're walking our

115
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,090
way down this whole key what does this

116
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,859
one look like yeah I'd call that a depth

117
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:35,469
of five and the last position exactly so

118
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,210
we've just decoded that key now that's

119
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,890
using calipers which is the most

120
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,479
universal way but you've got a you know

121
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,969
fuss and fart like you're someone in the

122
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,340
50s with a slide rule if you have a very

123
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,770
typical key most locksmiths will

124
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,229
actually have a key gage now key gage

125
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,940
cards you don't see sergeant on here

126
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,010
it's common but not as common as quick

127
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,350
set or Schlage right with a key gage

128
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,719
card you don't have to you know like

129
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,190
check a chart and do this you

130
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,930
can just slide that you stick the key

131
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,820
and slide it till it stops slide it till

132
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,940
it stops slide it bam bam bam bam bam

133
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,680
you can just decode that key and if you

134
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,390
have the bidding values of the key

135
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,610
you've got all the time in the world

136
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,719
somewhere else as long as you can go

137
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,970
alright I'm gonna get a blank I'm gonna

138
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,000
make a key that's really freakin easy

139
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,340
now sometimes you don't even have to do

140
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,570
this sometimes there are literally

141
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:27,369
visible codes stamped on a key and if

142
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,840
you've never seen this like we've got

143
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,900
some numbers here let me overlay some

144
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,679
bidding charts does this maybe look like

145
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:39,070
it might be eight six five five five or

146
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,900
you know two two eight three three like

147
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,120
it that's the act these are these are

148
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,190
called direct bidding codes and they

149
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,700
occur on keys more than you might

150
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,790
imagine

151
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,159
if you look at keys that you have you

152
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,390
might be astounded at how many I see

153
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,250
people reaching in pockets like right

154
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,039
now

155
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,750
so a lot of keys will have the direct

156
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,570
bidding code on them

157
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,420
well yeah I'm just winner right up here

158
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,830
so I like I dropped in the tool slack I

159
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,510
was like hey I need pictures of direct

160
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,669
bidding codes and like you know ever

161
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,330
like Brett was like boom I got some like

162
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,640
BAM

163
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,320
like so many people and my favorite was

164
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,060
from scorch scorch isn't with us right

165
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,500
now he's in China at DEFCON China but

166
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,290
scorch is like hey I got a direct

167
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:26,580
bidding code photo it's great okay

168
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:28,200
awesome don't know why that's there but

169
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,820
sure enough I was like is this a joke

170
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,909
you photoshopped that he's like no as an

171
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,980
Airbnb it totally worked

172
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,900
now not every code you will ever see on

173
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,700
the outside of something is a direct

174
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,190
bidding code this is an example of

175
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,900
packaging that says you know it's key to

176
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,550
like if you want to buy more of the same

177
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,700
so they're all key to like right four

178
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,040
eight eight four nine well this is a

179
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,469
quick set style system quick set doesn't

180
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,080
have an eight or a nine this can't be

181
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,600
the this could not be the key this is

182
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,580
called an indirect code or a blind code

183
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,250
which means it's kind of like a hashing

184
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,680
function right like if you have two

185
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,720
hashes that match well that means they

186
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,500
were probably the same password unless

187
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,300
you had a weird hash collision right so

188
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,190
consumers can get the same packaging and

189
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,720
like they will all match but the keys

190
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,190
they don't actually know the direct

191
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,919
bidding code unless they measure them

192
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,430
with a key gauge or caliper or unless

193
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,159
it's stamped on the key now this this is

194
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,340
- 3 - 5 - does that look like a direct

195
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,229
or indirect - 3 - 5 that looks like a

196
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,310
direct bidding code to me and the great

197
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:36,210
part is its visible through the

198
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,890
packaging so if you literally find like

199
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,479
a piece of trash and someone's you like

200
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,890
garbage like oh look they just bought

201
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,810
brand-new locks for this building they

202
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,430
were installing well I don't know what

203
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,630
this direct this direct code is this is

204
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,130
an indirect code but they probably

205
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,229
bought it at their local hardware store

206
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,270
so you go to that store and the way

207
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,890
stock shipments work is they're not

208
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,510
going to have an infinite number of

209
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,990
blind codes they're usually gonna have

210
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,330
five or six bidding sets and in that

211
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,190
code series like you're gonna find that

212
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,260
blind code on a piece of packaging and

213
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,669
you either buy it for nine bucks or you

214
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,270
flip it over and you might get lucky

215
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,340
enough to see

216
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,340
and there you go you've got someone's

217
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,659
key now the the whole thing about let's

218
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,008
say you have a blind code that you don't

219
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,680
know what's going on like for example

220
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:19,460
right here we have this lock and this

221
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,110
key is stamped three one eight eight

222
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,270
that doesn't really look like three one

223
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,590
eight eight exactly to me like yes this

224
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,330
might maybe that's a one but I'm not

225
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,000
sure this is this has got to be a blind

226
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,098
code okay that doesn't really help me

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,690
and maybe I don't have a piece of trash

228
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,000
that I can look up maybe I don't know

229
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,399
what store they bought this from well

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,740
again there is I showed you locksmith

231
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,110
software right there's a lot of lookup

232
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,570
software like this is codes online this

233
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,149
is like lock codes calm you can punch

234
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,620
that in here so code three one eight

235
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:53,670
eight this tells me six one three six

236
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,310
well let's look back at our key for a

237
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,349
second wait a minute what does that look

238
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:02,250
like to you is that maybe look like six

239
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,770
one three six absolutely but that's like

240
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,020
on the key again if you have the key you

241
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,730
have a lot of options it's so like that

242
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,470
scorch photo is the funny one where it's

243
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,670
stamped on the lock like that would just

244
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:17,040
be dumb like oh so there's a lot of

245
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,260
them stamped on a log yes stamping blind

246
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,959
codes on locks is a thing that happens

247
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,910
it happens on combination locks if

248
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,500
you've ever seen like the classic gym

249
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,600
locker lock I love showing this one

250
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,520
older locks are better for this because

251
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,709
the older code series are more widely

252
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,850
known in a lot of resources but because

253
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,670
you've you look on the back here you

254
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,959
might see a stamped or inked series of

255
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,490
numbers alright so 9039 58 well locks

256
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,099
don't go that high that that can't be

257
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,709
the real combination maybe that maybe

258
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,230
it's a blind code it's totally a blind

259
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,390
code there are books like this that

260
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,520
exist there are lookup like just whole

261
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,579
books that are just page after page of

262
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,920
luck codes there are they are online you

263
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:00,719
can sometimes find these PDFs people DM

264
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,699
me occasionally and I use I keep a link

265
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,190
somewhere that there's like a zip share

266
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,200
sketchy site Russia dot whatever domain

267
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,660
well you can get a zip file with these

268
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,130
kind of books in them or again just get

269
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,620
yourself a subscription to insta code

270
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,630
insta code is is my preferred

271
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,820
locksmithing software you got a little

272
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,630
search box so let's put that code in the

273
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,980
search box

274
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,930
kachunk Wow

275
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,060
two results well what brand lock was

276
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,040
that that was a master lock alright

277
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,300
let's let's go down let's find master

278
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,339
what kind of result boom 32 14 32 and in

279
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,469
case you've never had a locker in school

280
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,740
it literally tells you like which way to

281
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,810
dial a lot yeah

282
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,320
bonus insta code is a mobile app so you

283
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:45,089
can have this on your phone and every

284
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,710
time I or Howard or other people give

285
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,630
talks we're like insta codes totally

286
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,370
hidden subscriptions tonight but yeah

287
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,010
it's like literally 9 bucks a month to

288
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,670
maintain it and you get a ton of useful

289
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,770
information

290
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,719
those lock charts those key bidding

291
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,370
charts even if I'm just impression a

292
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,440
lock or doing any kind of weird attacks

293
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,050
it's nice to have that as a reference

294
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,640
and I strongly like they're they're

295
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,160
really cool yeah they're really cool of

296
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,260
resource that and lock codes online any

297
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,870
of these exist and they have existed for

298
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,120
a long time locksmiths use these and you

299
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:18,750
can use information like this to make

300
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,090
duplicate keys now of course once you

301
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,090
get the code data that you need you have

302
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:26,820
to turn that into something real right

303
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:29,760
so producing a duplicate key it's not

304
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,170
like you just took a key and you left

305
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,390
the building and went to the hardware

306
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,400
store like if you have a physical key

307
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,170
and you either hand it to someone or

308
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,610
nowadays increasingly more and more like

309
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,860
you use an automated machine right

310
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,990
having an original key that is

311
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,060
duplication if you don't have the

312
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,730
original but you have the bidding data

313
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,130
that is known as originating a key and

314
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,960
you can still do that like there are

315
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,790
machines that will just do like you can

316
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,070
punch in their call code cutting

317
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,750
machines in many cases locksmiths will

318
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,280
often charge you more money and they

319
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,280
might ask you a couple more questions

320
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,550
be ready to social engineer like you can

321
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,230
originate a key just from the code this

322
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,510
is a really nice machine this is Asoka

323
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,060
Futura I mean there's manual machines

324
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,700
this is like I own this little HPC punch

325
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,640
and there's no electricity whatsoever it

326
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,280
is an analog series of little micrometer

327
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,080
kind of adjustments so you can adjust

328
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,660
your Traverse you can adjust your plunge

329
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,030
and the way you do different brands of

330
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,310
lock is by switching out these blue

331
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,620
cards because every lock can be

332
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,930
expressed as like how far side to side

333
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,330
and how far in or out is your bid

334
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,550
position your bidding depth we don't

335
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,440
watch the whole video here but if you

336
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,290
want to see like kachunk it's a giant

337
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,149
nipper so like here we have loaded a

338
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,189
card this looks like a Schlage and I'm

339
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:49,410
gonna cut a Schlage key and if I've

340
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,420
gotten the bidding because I looked it

341
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,670
up or I copy the key no like the photo

342
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,270
of the key or I found a blind code or

343
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,510
something

344
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,910
so alright my key lines up this way lock

345
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:03,060
the key in and right under my hands is

346
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,100
this little tiny nip jaw and I'm gonna

347
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,479
scroll ahead so you can see alright so

348
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,459
we've got our position we know what we

349
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,270
want all right what's our depth there it

350
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:14,489
is okay Kirt chunk and little by little

351
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,980
you just nip a bunch of bytes out of

352
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,260
this key almost at the end there that's

353
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,990
the fourth position my fifth position is

354
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,510
what depth it's a five let's scroll over

355
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,339
okay we're at five depth

356
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,200
kachunk and this is a commercial

357
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,230
probably installation that I was copying

358
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,529
it's 6-pin my last depth is one okay

359
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,270
dial it up to one kajam all right and

360
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,180
then you release the key and like that

361
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,949
blank key one minute later no sound no

362
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,949
electricity you can do this like in your

363
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,140
car but that's a working key like that's

364
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,990
a perfectly valid way to do it we've

365
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,910
done this like in in like unused

366
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,130
cubicles with something called a

367
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,189
pack-a-punch this is the smallest

368
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,500
possible version of a key code nipper

369
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,270
like this now again everything's a

370
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,790
trade-off right everything's a trade-off

371
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,069
that whole the original punch the

372
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,829
trade-off is your cuts are a little bit

373
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:10,470
messy and a really cold head locksmith

374
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,970
if you show them a key let me like that

375
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,130
looks like you make this on a punch

376
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,589
because it's not the same as like a nice

377
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,490
clean cutter wheel this little sucker

378
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,950
this pack-a-punch

379
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,420
again I can dial all my depths I can

380
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,910
choose my position but what's the

381
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,130
trade-off the trade-off is if you saw

382
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,829
there's a letter S on the side this is

383
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,800
Schlage only you have to choose what

384
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:33,149
brand you're attacking so my my like

385
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,099
it's super compact I can throw this in

386
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:36,510
my back pocket but I better be attacking

387
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,279
a Schlage lock if I have this backup

388
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,290
punch which most of the time in

389
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,939
commercial America a lot of Schlage

390
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,490
systems out there so of course we use

391
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,279
these but the same idea I've got to

392
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,709
traverse and that whole jaw head can

393
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,709
can ratchet up or down based on this

394
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,878
little adjustment wheel on the back and

395
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,729
then you'll actually see like little

396
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:59,999
bits of metal like fall out the bottom

397
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:01,499
nip falls right down and in the end you

398
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,600
can go nip nip nip right through the key

399
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:05,220
like these are online this is the

400
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,339
pack-a-punch is like four hundred some

401
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,350
dollars and it's like barrett brock age

402
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,670
sells it on lock picks calm like a 1

403
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,800
makes it it's one of the few things they

404
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,599
make really really perfectly nicely it's

405
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,420
really great tool and there you go this

406
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,610
is same key again made silently made

407
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,469
like I've done this literally in

408
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,209
bathroom stalls and just like punch

409
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,569
little pieces of brass into a sink and

410
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:29,489
then like there's my key it just works

411
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:31,589
now of course what's the catch and

412
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,889
everything you've been seeing so far you

413
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:36,870
need a blank blanks can get weird too

414
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,879
source key ways can get really

415
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,370
complicated depending on how exotic a

416
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,949
lock system is even mainstream brands

417
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,749
that you know social egg right like

418
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:47,729
everyone who's seen Ashley key it's

419
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:49,470
probably seen a Schlage see maybe a

420
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,750
handful of you have Ashley e they're

421
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,050
they're kind of out there but not much

422
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,480
if you've ever seen an F or a G that's

423
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,920
really freakin rare I'm I'd be

424
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,509
astonished unless you're in the lock

425
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,759
trade if you encounter these with any

426
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,769
regularity and then there's multi

427
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,870
section keys you know key ways and

428
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:09,600
there's multi section blanks there is

429
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,670
like the super Suprema like works in

430
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,800
everything which we keep on hand like we

431
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,259
keep a bunch of Schlage else or Kaba

432
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,180
Elco calls them the SC 20 we keep those

433
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,009
in our field kit because if we ever

434
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,040
encounter a Schlage key even just like a

435
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:24,600
photo if we make it on an L blank it's

436
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,040
gonna work no matter what key way

437
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,649
they're using that's awesome

438
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,059
Yael Yael is another example like look

439
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,129
at this freaking key blank chart there's

440
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:34,529
a ton of bizarre key blanks in the world

441
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:36,720
even for systems you know the name of

442
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,980
now if you don't know the name of a

443
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,470
system or if you're not sure what

444
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,569
they're using the ill co key blank

445
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,259
directory is really nice to have Kaabah

446
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,479
Elko

447
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,639
it's really cool they don't just list

448
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,889
and it's all a PDF by the way it's

449
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,410
available published but it's also online

450
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:55,589
as a series of PDFs they don't just list

451
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:58,170
their brands of if you notice like

452
00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:00,179
this is JMA JMA is a mexican company

453
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,930
that actually sells stuff you sometimes

454
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:03,959
can't find

455
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:06,270
in the US like reverse Yale keyways when

456
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,949
I like it's a postal restricted key and

457
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,650
I got one of those once for a project

458
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:12,720
and everything is printed to scale so if

459
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,630
you hold a blank up to the page it'll

460
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,150
it'll be the right size so as much as

461
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,459
you can there are resources out there to

462
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,709
figure out what key you're talking about

463
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,270
and by the way little tip from me to you

464
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,490
if you have a key in your hands for like

465
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,740
one second trying to do this

466
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,510
this is a terrible photo this will not

467
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,820
help you your teammates will be like why

468
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,309
did you do this this is awful get

469
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,200
any piece of of paper scrub it

470
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:38,940
black marker all over it and stab

471
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,470
through the paper you will take a much

472
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,059
better photo and you'll be able to

473
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,660
figure out your key blank later you will

474
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,190
thank me so alright you can figure out

475
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,559
your key bidding you can figure out your

476
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,150
blank you either source like a code

477
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,720
cutting machine or a pack a punch or

478
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,600
something you're set what happens if a

479
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,610
key blank is complete impossible to find

480
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,860
what happens if there's no branding you

481
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,928
have no idea what this key way is you

482
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,340
have no idea how to source it you're

483
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,050
like maybe even if you can you're

484
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,790
sending photos to friends in a signal

485
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,409
group and they're like wow are you in

486
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,450
Taiwan that's a Taiwanese lock you're

487
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,580
like no I'm in Oklahoma can you get me

488
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,429
the key they're like not this week how

489
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,559
long is your job like if you have no way

490
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,900
of getting the blank that is what we're

491
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,420
gonna talk about tonight

492
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,190
completely unobtainium blanks you can't

493
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,740
figure out get them you can do a cast

494
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,550
and mold attack right if you make a mold

495
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:35,070
of a key and then cast it out of metal

496
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:37,470
it's not that hard it seems really weird

497
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,450
we're gonna try to do it I'm gonna walk

498
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,429
you through it and I brought a ton of

499
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,370
freaking metal and clay and weird locks

500
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:45,750
and for example like these are if you

501
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,239
see sitting on this table here we're

502
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,640
gonna use these in a contest later this

503
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,290
is a nice regular looking padlock right

504
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,970
but this is not a conventional key you

505
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,070
would find this is this is a rotating

506
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,050
disk system this is not a key that

507
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,000
you're just gonna find at Home Depot so

508
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,730
how would you copy something like that

509
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,830
well we'll talk about it so what can we

510
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,980
do right well it literally involves

511
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:11,610
using clay like modeling clay you put

512
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,440
clay in a little case you put your key

513
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,530
in the clay you want to make sure the

514
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,840
clay releases

515
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,220
so before you put the key in you put a

516
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,870
little bit of powder in there there's a

517
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,610
number of different releasing agents you

518
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,479
can use I just happen to have cornstarch

519
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:27,760
baby powder I promise it's that all

520
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,880
right so you rub the rub a little powder

521
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,760
on there you got your key cram that key

522
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,560
in extra hard pop it out so what do you

523
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,850
have now you have a nice negative mold

524
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:42,790
of this key usually the very top will be

525
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:45,219
you know as as narrow and tight as the

526
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:47,139
key that's a little hard if you're about

527
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,390
to pour a bunch of hot metal in a super

528
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,710
thin slot so what people often do and

529
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,210
you'll see me do this and I'm gonna try

530
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,650
to do this live I could train wreck the

531
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,590
hell out of this you never know but

532
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:01,170
it live demos right so some exactly

533
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:03,699
 do it live things sucks

534
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,960
so you many people will make like a

535
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,730
little thumbprint to make kind of a

536
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,830
funnel make it a little bit easier to

537
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,420
pour the metal in by the way when you're

538
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,399
pouring metal in you want the metal to

539
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,710
settle all the way in you'll see I

540
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,960
advocate strongly drawing a little vent

541
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,850
so this is just me using a lockpick and

542
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,830
I'm actually just drawing this little

543
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,379
sort of snorkel vent so that the air

544
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:26,100
inside the mold has a place to escape

545
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,600
out put that mold back together

546
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,370
sometimes you know I'll use a big clamp

547
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,350
like this or if you just have little

548
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,060
binder clamp like little clips that's

549
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,010
fine too anything so that you're not

550
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,159
your hands aren't on the mold while

551
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:41,890
you're pouring hot metal in the ship but

552
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,690
yeah a little cigar torch lighter is not

553
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,880
mandatory it's what I'm going to use but

554
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,480
you can use a regular bic lighter that's

555
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,490
fine

556
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,930
here we have our mold ready we've got

557
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,720
our lighter ready we just need metal

558
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,640
right so the metal we use is a low

559
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,860
melting point alloy there's a number of

560
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,260
low melt point alloys out there this one

561
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,439
melts at around I think it's about 158

562
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,000
degrees something like that so any kind

563
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,790
of lighter you can get your your alloy

564
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,800
to melt down try not to let it start

565
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,060
gassing off like this is full of a lot

566
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,040
of compounds you don't want to breathe

567
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,480
or get on you it's so this is woods

568
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,000
metal I don't know if anyone does arts

569
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,800
and crafts woods metal has LED in it has

570
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,870
cadmium in it it's got a lot of things

571
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,060
that are generally not an ld50 you want

572
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,669
to screw with so just don't you know

573
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:27,639
don't like don't have food and drink on

574
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:31,249
the surface where you're doing it

575
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:33,129
you know and you should be fine once

576
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:36,009
you've got it liquid you pour that in

577
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:39,649
and you'll see it go right in and just

578
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:41,600
just tap tap tap tap let it settle and

579
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:44,418
just let it sit it needs

580
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,370
I'm gonna say on a good day five minutes

581
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:47,470
but sometimes you've you really pressed

582
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,789
for time you can go a little quicker

583
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,830
hopefully if we just tell jokes and do

584
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:53,330
Q&A I will actually let it sit

585
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,649
still and let it harden all the way

586
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,749
before I try to take it out that's

587
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:58,998
because I'm Way too enthusiastic most of

588
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:01,039
the time but if it all hardens up

589
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:03,110
perfectly and you pop it out like there

590
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,059
you go you might have a little bit of

591
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,889
that trail hanging off the end from that

592
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:08,539
snorkel but that you can just knock that

593
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:10,039
off with a finger or you know shave it

594
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:13,309
down with a hand file or anything like

595
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:15,649
that and it is it's hard enough that it

596
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,869
should operate most locks like if it's a

597
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:18,439
deadbolt that really needs a lot of

598
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,019
torque

599
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,119
sometimes we'll play around with carving

600
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:25,129
a little hollow in the key and throwing

601
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,619
a lock pick turning tool in so the key

602
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:29,149
sets the bidding the turning tool made

603
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:31,340
us seal is what your wrenching on the

604
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:34,428
deadbolt with but most of the time like

605
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,889
bam you're there that'll work not

606
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:38,809
infinitely forever again like in this

607
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:41,899
case woods metal or Sarah safe Sarah

608
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,009
Bend these are they're strong enough but

609
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:45,408
you would want to use them infinitely

610
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:46,850
one one dude he showed this to some

611
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,669
people and he was like oh that's so cool

612
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:52,519
I own this ABLOY lock and it's got these

613
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:55,460
the keys are like $28 to copy a key I'm

614
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:57,409
just gonna do this I'm like like forever

615
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,480
he's like yeah I don't know I was like I

616
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,820
really wouldn't do that like the the $28

617
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,529
key is one thing it's $150 lock and if

618
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,019
you trash the key in it like break it

619
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:08,690
off like dude pay the 28 bucks how did

620
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:10,970
you buy the lock in the first place but

621
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,309
yeah I really love this tactic if you

622
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,289
have a weird-ass key if you have weird

623
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:17,509
rotating disc mechanisms like we have

624
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,549
here for example these are not common in

625
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:22,730
America we do encounter them on overseas

626
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:24,499
jobs and we've absolutely done you know

627
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,850
just can't like mold and cast attacks

628
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:27,950
because that's all we got

629
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,629
I don't have time to go like find a

630
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,039
local locksmith and bribe them or

631
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:33,320
something and like get blanks that I'm

632
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,570
not supposed to have so if you want to

633
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,129
do this at home I'm a big proponent of

634
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,049
like open source the out of

635
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:41,419
anything you know and give it away

636
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:43,400
the woods metal you can find a lot of it

637
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,220
line you can find these huge block

638
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:49,370
ingots they're not useful in this giant

639
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,720
slab size what you do is you take a

640
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,550
little like cup that you don't care

641
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,110
about and don't do this when you're

642
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,330
cooking dinner obviously because you

643
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,790
should keep this away from food but yeah

644
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,560
you melt that sucker down and what I

645
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,430
bought is I bought these little silicon

646
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,510
tiny tiny teeny ice cube tray things

647
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,860
because they like to make ice cubes to

648
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,540
go in water bottles and I was like is

649
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,850
this gonna destroy this no it doesn't

650
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,889
destroy this awesome yeah silicon so

651
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,980
like yeah just pour this into your

652
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,450
silicon mold and let it sit let it

653
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,130
harden and it takes a while to cool

654
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,050
because it's a lot it's a very very

655
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,720
thermally dense material it's a very

656
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,370
dense metal once it's cooled you pop all

657
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,170
that out of there some of them are

658
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,310
perfect cubes some of them are not you

659
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,320
take the ones that aren't perfect you

660
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,629
remelt them and you keep on keeping on

661
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,689
right so you can make yourself a ton of

662
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,720
these and it turns out most keys really

663
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,250
only need about one of these cubes most

664
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,890
of the time especially for really thin

665
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,390
american-style keys these big fat ones

666
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,400
that I'm gonna do I might use a second

667
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,230
cube but yeah you can make a bazillion

668
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,720
of these little cubes for not a lot of

669
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,980
money yes you got oh where do I get the

670
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,910
tray yeah there you go yeah we do it

671
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:57,020
everything is flagging online

672
00:24:52,910 --> 00:25:00,080
everything's on the Amazon the clay it

673
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,700
needs to be polymer clay squeak earlier

674
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,710
you were like oh man I do stuff with

675
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,080
kids like you know sculpey sculpey clay

676
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,580
is it's it's gonna work really well it's

677
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,010
not gonna fall apart under liquid

678
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,020
conditions or heat conditions it will

679
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:15,080
start because this is an oven fired clay

680
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,860
right it will start to harden if you use

681
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,899
this clay

682
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,760
you can't like infinitely reuse it and

683
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,310
remake it you can remake more than one

684
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,500
key but you can't mash it up forever and

685
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,510
keep remaking more and more like it's

686
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,520
cheap right lates it's goddamn 15 bucks

687
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,640
for ten of these goddamn things just you

688
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,110
all make a good living buy more this is

689
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,360
the cheapest lead ladle we've ever found

690
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:38,060
although somebody at a another con I was

691
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,800
at he showed me it was like a gravy

692
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,290
spoon or something that he found on

693
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,970
Amazon that was cheaper than this I was

694
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,490
like wow four dollar gravy spoon right

695
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,080
on it was sure just don't mix it up with

696
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,910
the silverware at home

697
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,980
the most expensive thing you're gonna

698
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,600
see me use is this cigar lighter which

699
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,210
is the least necessary thing if you've

700
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,530
got time a regular like stand there for

701
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,480
four or five minutes with a lighter like

702
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,450
it'll get it cooking but the cigar

703
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,030
lighter works very fast and then these

704
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,070
trays so yeah I just had a rough idea of

705
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,990
what I wanted because there's various

706
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,330
clamshell trays and they're all way too

707
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,460
expensive online and number it like lock

708
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,620
master sells them German company sells

709
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,600
them but I was in the tool channel and I

710
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,189
was like here's somebody I suck at 3d

711
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,080
modeling but what if we did this and

712
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,540
Jimmy Long's and I batted some ideas

713
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,610
back and forth he designed this Matt

714
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,950
Burroughs like printed it and we had a

715
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,020
bunch of these at lock fest if you want

716
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,520
to try I brought like all this I

717
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,700
brought enough for people to check it

718
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,129
out if you ever do this again

719
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,840
woods metal isn't great to handle I have

720
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,370
gloves I'm probably not gonna use them

721
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,149
because I'm old I'm dying one

722
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:46,100
day woods metal like woods metal has led

723
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,500
in it it has cadmium in it these are not

724
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,780
thing most most low melt point alloys

725
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,330
will have some stuff in them you don't

726
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,850
want the only one that really exists

727
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,290
that is safe is feels metal and it's

728
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,360
much more expensive because feels medal

729
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,370
has indium so you can get feels metal

730
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,679
online in fact some tool people in the

731
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,570
slack like somebody try I think Flay or

732
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,490
somebody like bought fields metal he's

733
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,740
like I hope this is correct this is some

734
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,390
crazy Chinese iam and he and

735
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,560
Cristina did a melt point test and like

736
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,840
hey I think it's actually Fields Medal

737
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,659
good job safe to handle me I just you

738
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,330
know don't like put it in your drinks or

739
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,670
something

740
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,840
so what how about we try this should we

741
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,870
try this for a second how we doing on

742
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,870
time

743
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:32,450
alright we're only like 40 minutes in

744
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,040
we're looking pretty good let me swing

745
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,250
this camera around so it looks a little

746
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:40,790
more normal like alright so here we go

747
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,960
we've got ya okay just put that over

748
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:47,639
there

749
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:49,590
which key is which okay so we have a

750
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,260
couple of these weird rotating disk lock

751
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,959
keys right and let's say we want to copy

752
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,290
that I'm just gonna kind of like Tony

753
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:03,030
Bennett at this this hour of the evening

754
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:05,100
exactly so it's hard to find blanks for

755
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,780
these because again like these are from

756
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,389
Malaysia or something I don't freaking

757
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,550
know but we've got clay we've got a

758
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,870
little mold if you buy the sculpey stuff

759
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:16,139
that one of the biggest problems people

760
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:18,270
have is too much too much clay too

761
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,910
much metal they have these little for

762
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:24,780
bangers in here just break off a single

763
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:26,840
log that is all you need and you really

764
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,300
like you can split this in half and

765
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:33,870
that's more than enough to fill up

766
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:35,190
absolutely both of these channels so

767
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,050
we're gonna kind of do this and if you

768
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,490
have questions like I can kind of answer

769
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,909
questions if you shout them out or

770
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,140
something

771
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:44,970
so how legal is this I mean if you're

772
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,740
allowed to copy the key it's probably

773
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,980
very legal if you're not as allowed to

774
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,980
like

775
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,350
technically I think cot it's like

776
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,909
copying the key isn't illegal just

777
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,899
opening the doors illegal if you're not

778
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:01,460
supposed to ransom yeah

779
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,170
fun fact there are a handful of keys

780
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,630
that are actually restricted by code if

781
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,830
you like people always talk to me about

782
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:09,020
Howard and I have done the lock

783
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,399
elevator lock talk right so there are

784
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,500
certain keys that are actually

785
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,240
restricted by statute that unless you

786
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,550
are an authority having jurisdiction

787
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,380
you're not officially supposed to have

788
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,940
certain like fire keys or something like

789
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,970
that

790
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:25,790
so I'm just gonna yeah will this work on

791
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,980
automotive keys yes but the opportunity

792
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:31,940
cost is much higher if it doesn't play

793
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:34,160
nice in the lock so yeah like if you

794
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,930
have a by the way if you're ever doing

795
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,910
any monkey business with a car right

796
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,380
like you know use the passenger door

797
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,050
don't use the driver's side door because

798
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,850
if you bone it well mmm who cares like

799
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:46,639
it's block you never usually use a key

800
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:54,320
in so we got our little I swear this is

801
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:56,510
not cocaine bullet officer so I've done

802
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,830
an a Beloit protec with this protag one

803
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,780
not protect two because they have the

804
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,220
little interactive element that's one

805
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,500
way to not

806
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,320
I mean defeat this completely but make

807
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,030
it meaning meaningfully not practical

808
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,950
would be to have an interactive element

809
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,660
on the key which is a little floating

810
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,280
element like a ball bearing or something

811
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,890
anything that moves anything with a

812
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,980
magnet if you see me walkies from Japan

813
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:21,170
if you've seen like the MCS by Ewa which

814
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,820
is a Austrian brand like you're not

815
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:25,100
going to meaningfully duplicate that

816
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,379
well but this is I mean this is all just

817
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,300
a solid piece of metal it's exotically

818
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,490
shaped right but it's just a piece of

819
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,700
metal now do you think I want to like

820
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:36,410
mash down really hard no no I want to

821
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,780
just see how it's slipping around on

822
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,640
this on the powder I want to just give

823
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,040
it a little what for just so it's not

824
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,190
slipping around it'll it'll just stay

825
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,920
still long enough that I can line this

826
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:51,380
up now I could just crush this with my

827
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,150
hand alone what I like to do honestly is

828
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,160
just kind of stand on it really fast and

829
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:59,519
you're gonna get a lot of like smooshy

830
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:08,080
action with the clay that's okay

831
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:10,659
yes it is exactly oh really cool

832
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,658
question have I ever tried casting with

833
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:15,969
a Turner tool in the mold no because

834
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:18,999
that would artificially make it wider

835
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:22,269
than it needs to be what I have done so

836
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:23,889
when I talked about there we go I don't

837
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:25,619
want to disturb the mold when I pop it

838
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:27,939
out so I do that when I talked about

839
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:29,738
making a little bit of extra space you

840
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,710
would actually take a pinch of clay and

841
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:38,649
put it back in the mold so that it's

842
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:41,200
artificially not there oh oh when the

843
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:43,389
metal goes in no that's an interesting

844
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,159
question that would almost maybe put the

845
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:46,839
Turner tool like very affixed to it

846
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:50,580
that's a really neat idea I've never

847
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:53,109
tried it maybe we'll do that one time

848
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:57,549
yeah let's by all means

849
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:58,989
so this looks pretty good to me I mean

850
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:01,599
it's I don't know how well how well we

851
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:09,200
can see this it's oh wow super

852
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:12,300
blown out here let's did it work yeah

853
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,840
like this has some potential and again

854
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:20,520
we want to have just a little vent you

855
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,409
wanna have what does so that's a really

856
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,790
good point right if you have a key and

857
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:28,440
it says do not duplicate that is as well

858
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:32,240
it has no legal bearing for the most

859
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,280
part for the most part locksmiths

860
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,070
locksmiths will honor do not duplicate

861
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,070
because typically when a locksmith

862
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,720
orders blank for their shop they will

863
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,850
order blanks that will often come with

864
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,500
what they call a new turbo even if you

865
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,080
get a Schlage or a quick set it has this

866
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,060
larger blocky shaped bow on the top and

867
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,649
will often have their branding on one

868
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,960
side their contact info and do not

869
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,690
duplicate on the back most locksmiths

870
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,610
will honor do not duplicate in the same

871
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,310
way that they expect other locksmiths to

872
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,530
honor there's there's no legal basis for

873
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,419
it whatsoever there's no one will get in

874
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:09,660
trouble for like duplicating and do not

875
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:11,550
duplicate key it is just yeah you just

876
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,110
exactly and like if you ever have a key

877
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:15,000
that says doing a duplicate you

878
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:17,100
literally just like get I've been in

879
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,020
Home Depot where they said hey you won't

880
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,389
we can't do this says we do not make

881
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,490
these ok sorry sorry I told me to bother

882
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,530
you those little rubber key covers that

883
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,420
they're $9.99 I can I buy a pack of them

884
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:29,220
and like you know have my buddy come

885
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,420
back five seconds later and he's like

886
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,040
this is the key to my grandma's attic

887
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,500
she's dead I really missed her I'm

888
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,060
crying can you make my key like and it's

889
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:41,670
got a little rubber cover over it so

890
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:45,270
they're not freakin reading it yeah fire

891
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:48,630
is doing fiery things now this the

892
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:51,930
actual metal spoon itself will have a

893
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,970
lot of heat absorption so you don't need

894
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:58,140
to you up to apply fire until it's

895
00:33:53,970 --> 00:34:01,010
completely melted right about here I'm

896
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:04,170
probably going to cut my flame off and

897
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,250
it's perfectly enough to be very very

898
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,250
liquid I don't know if that's coming

899
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,960
through on camera oh man we're coming

900
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,530
through it's there we

901
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:18,389
go this is really clamped on hard but

902
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:20,400
we're gonna try it oh we got a little

903
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,389
leakage oh we might have let's see what

904
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,690
happened there we might have leaked out

905
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,859
the side yeah

906
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,869
that didn't look good so let's check

907
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:28,139
let's check what happened we can

908
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:30,990
probably reuse the mold and the metal Oh

909
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,970
interesting it actually leaked out a

910
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:36,759
side oh wow ok so you see what happened

911
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:46,239
here it leaked No

912
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:49,149
oh my god here hang yeah so what

913
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:52,899
happened is the little sort of snorkel

914
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:55,779
that I made was so far out of the lane

915
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:58,299
that it came down and it leaked out one

916
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:02,290
of these side vents these vents some

917
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,400
people like these side vents for for

918
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,579
yeah for expansion

919
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,579
I honestly let me see this if I just if

920
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:11,560
I just closed this off and remember I'm

921
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:16,210
using my gloves to stay very very safe

922
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:25,180
right now of course yep

923
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:27,130
yeah I'm just gonna try to remelt and

924
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:39,578
just so you can see this side got a

925
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:41,319
little bit of metal on it if which which

926
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:49,750
stuff melt where there was a lot of

927
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:50,680
nonspecific dangling modifiers ah yes so

928
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,319
it was a little hard to see on camera

929
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,690
the one side that has some metal has

930
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:59,470
almost none it has like a dusting of

931
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:02,950
metal barely any am I still looking good

932
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:06,859
on the camera there now maybe this works

933
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:10,089
maybe maybe it doesn't I know right

934
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,090
[Music]

935
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:20,109
well it didn't leak out was it warm on

936
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,500
the tray a little warm like I knew I

937
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:25,029
knew there had been heat applied it

938
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,040
wasn't enough to burn me right now this

939
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,319
is concentrated this is a concentrated

940
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:33,390
mass and it's liquid and so that's

941
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:35,290
that's up there you know what's that

942
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,598
could you quench it that's an

943
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:42,880
interesting question I've never tried

944
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:51,190
that like in the toilet right there in

945
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:53,319
the in the glass true it's funny too

946
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,230
because these molds that people like the

947
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:57,940
actual tray people used to make them out

948
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,500
of metal and they're really gold is it

949
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,460
acts as a heat sink I'm like I don't

950
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,319
really think is I think that clay is

951
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,319
kind of an insulator I see a hand yes

952
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,000
really cool question the question was

953
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,069
some states view lockpicks differently

954
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,890
under the law not as many states as we

955
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:20,859
think there are four states of concern

956
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:24,310
so Virginia Mississippi Ohio and Nevada

957
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:27,460
those states lockpicks are not illegal

958
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:29,170
they are considered potentially evidence

959
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,700
of your criminal intent unless you have

960
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:32,650
an explanation as to why you own them

961
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,930
they're not like go directly to jail

962
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,490
Tennessee is also a state that as I'm

963
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,359
wiping my mucous membranes with

964
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,189
lid

965
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,470
Tennessee is also a state that's a

966
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,270
little questionable I like to someone

967
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,939
said you know is this illegal to have

968
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:47,710
like I like to think it's not it's not

969
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,720
an entry tool unless you've made a key

970
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,990
out of it like until then it's just clay

971
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:57,779
in some 3d printed resin I've never

972
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:57,779
tested that in court sir yes question

973
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:03,490
what I worry about it breaking if I

974
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:06,400
quenched it I in general as you pointed

975
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:08,950
out like quenching is a very violently

976
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,140
arresting process and it causes metal to

977
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,149
do different things in fact woods metal

978
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,828
and especially fields metal has a small

979
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,990
expansion coefficient when it hardens

980
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:19,240
and I don't know how well that would

981
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:21,819
play if it was rapidly hardened or

982
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,950
quenched I mean we could try that like

983
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:26,319
by all means we got enough stuff here I

984
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,538
brought a lot of parts in a lot of clay

985
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:32,170
and a lot of things so let's exhaust all

986
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:35,020
the possibilities yes sir I do

987
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,760
dr. Tran help me out here this the

988
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,200
refill has to do with a contest that

989
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,180
we'll talk about in a little bit here

990
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,430
because there is a special there's a

991
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,129
channel who was at whiskey con who was

992
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,868
not at whiskey con dr. Tran put that

993
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,089
bottle up here for a second so we

994
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:54,220
brought a number of things - whiskey con

995
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:55,960
and if you're interested in the chance

996
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,618
to sample some things that are hard to

997
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,109
find

998
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:01,049
in fact that's we thank you we here's

999
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:03,400
here's the challenge that we have right

1000
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:04,809
during the party afterward which is at

1001
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,990
the second floor bar is that correct

1002
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:09,880
somebody is that where the party is in

1003
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:11,680
the lot is the lobbyist downstairs oh

1004
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,630
the first night before yeah the first

1005
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,930
night bar so the the first floor bar

1006
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:20,319
down by the alright there is this little

1007
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:25,299
box that I've made okay this box can

1008
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:28,029
perfectly hold a glass so the glass is

1009
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:30,819
going to go in the box a poor Pappy will

1010
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:32,650
go in the glass forgot the glass will

1011
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:35,020
then get closed in the box and we will

1012
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:37,990
use one of these you know hard to source

1013
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:40,000
the blanks for locks now we tried this

1014
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,450
in the room even if this demo train

1015
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,380
wrecks

1016
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:46,808
we made this work so we are gonna let

1017
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,880
anyone who can try to make a key if you

1018
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:51,190
can get the key to work you can unlock

1019
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,170
the box you can have the drink and we'll

1020
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,529
keep on going until we've exhausted this

1021
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,529
bottle

1022
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:06,560
yeah or the hotel stops us so let's see

1023
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:08,920
this is warm but not like hurting me so

1024
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,750
I'm gonna say it might be in good shape

1025
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,480
which kita we use this key which this

1026
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:18,470
key was probably this lock now I think

1027
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:22,490
it was the other luck really all right

1028
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:24,950
well yeah we'll take a look I don't know

1029
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:28,549
how we're doing on camera that looks

1030
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:30,830
kind of like this key to me all right

1031
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:35,410
let me let me drop her down a little bit

1032
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:38,420
there so that looks pretty goddamn good

1033
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:41,120
the hardest part when taking this out is

1034
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,310
I don't want to crack the key because

1035
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,529
it's got this weird stress concentration

1036
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:47,420
the way this is designed now of course

1037
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,300
we got this little nib on the front tip

1038
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,010
and this is a tip stop key so we want to

1039
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:56,480
make sure it fits all the way in the

1040
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:59,780
lock but let's see it feels like it's in

1041
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:09,400
there feels like it's not quite all the

1042
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:09,400
way in there oh no we're gonna fix this

1043
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,530
hang on we got it out we're gonna we got

1044
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,420
it out we're gonna we're gonna redo one

1045
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:21,800
more time because who cares I'm

1046
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:23,540
the last talk is woods metal magnetic so

1047
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:28,580
as far as I can tell there's nothing

1048
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:29,450
ferrous in woods metal all right do we

1049
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:34,040
want to try it one more time how we

1050
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:36,140
doing on time I feel like this is kind

1051
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,870
of an important thing to talk about and

1052
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,270
and not enough not enough talks really

1053
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:43,670
mention this like I've had a lot of

1054
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,980
people come up to me at this con and say

1055
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,570
like oh man like you and Howard and Tran

1056
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,280
and everybody and like Patrick with the

1057
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,310
lockpick village like I love all the

1058
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,200
 you do and it's so cool like most

1059
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,600
of this stuff I do doesn't work the

1060
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,390
first time or the second like a lot of

1061
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,190
 won't work really well for you like

1062
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,710
that this is this is hacking hacking is

1063
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:06,520
not oh my god two people typing on the

1064
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,520
same keyboard we're awesome

1065
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:13,350
hacking is mostly like doing dumb stuff

1066
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,550
that doesn't work until it does so you

1067
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,690
know maybe this is gonna work this time

1068
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,910
maybe it's not

1069
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:21,240
I think the key didn't get far enough in

1070
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:24,330
the last time I did it I will actually

1071
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,819
probably reach into my picks it and just

1072
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:29,430
have a file at the ready in case I need

1073
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,020
to file the tip-off but yeah like

1074
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:36,270
everybody who's ever

1075
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:37,680
yes question in the back so that's a

1076
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,480
really that's a fun point and that's

1077
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,040
like that's a larger conversation to

1078
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,840
have at the bar something the question

1079
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,900
was so should we all change our locks

1080
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,640
now like ultimately no for a number of

1081
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,870
variety of reasons not not the least of

1082
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,629
which is that most people are

1083
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:53,549
fundamentally good the world isn't a

1084
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,630
really dangerous place not with the news

1085
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:57,570
or other people would have you believe

1086
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:59,730
like most people who do you harm

1087
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,350
aren't doing you like this takes a lot

1088
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,180
of skill to learn and a lot of

1089
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:05,279
investment of time and material most

1090
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,440
people who are bad people are doing

1091
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,410
really obvious dumb things they're using

1092
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,150
bolt cutters and bricks if you really

1093
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,890
have a resource that you care about and

1094
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:16,470
this is stuff talked about this in other

1095
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:20,190
talks that there are there kind of

1096
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:23,040
symbolic locks that just represent hey

1097
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:24,570
this is my shed please don't come in

1098
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,610
here you don't belong in here and that's

1099
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:28,650
you know your hardware store master

1100
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:30,690
multi numbered combination lock

1101
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,280
but that's that's not really gonna keep

1102
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,530
anyone out right there's a billion buy

1103
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,810
passes for it but if someone is ever in

1104
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,550
that room like that's a commitment that

1105
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:41,009
they've made they've made the commitment

1106
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,900
to say I am disregarding this barrier

1107
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:45,060
and I'm like they know they're doing

1108
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,980
wrong so that's a symbolic lock you can

1109
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,509
have residential grade security which is

1110
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,820
probably fine for most of your

1111
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,620
situations and then you have a security

1112
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:55,410
situation where you have a very

1113
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:57,390
important high-value resource and if you

1114
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:59,910
have a really important resource well

1115
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,440
that's you know Trant like our lives are

1116
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:04,080
consulting about this kind of right

1117
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,930
there are expensive very intricate

1118
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,840
solutions that will resist a variety of

1119
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:11,580
intricate finesse based attacks and if

1120
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,520
you need that level of security sure

1121
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,380
like it's out there but the the bigger

1122
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,420
thing in the world for me is not it's

1123
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,060
not scary to me that this kind of attack

1124
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,370
exists

1125
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:22,870
scary to me that people think they need

1126
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:25,150
more security than they really need and

1127
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,440
they waste right if you're not threat

1128
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,790
modeling if you're preparing for the

1129
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,010
wrong threat your weight you're throwing

1130
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,200
good money after bad and I don't know

1131
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:40,450
like there's money can be better spent

1132
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:42,220
in this world yes so there was a

1133
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:43,870
question about number push-button locks

1134
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,850
which is kind of a broad statement and a

1135
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:50,620
combination lock she said electronic

1136
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:52,150
combination locks oh so like if you ever

1137
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,950
seen an Airbnb where like everyone's

1138
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,710
Airbnb nowadays is some kind of keypad

1139
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:59,109
based lock some of them are good some of

1140
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,810
them are most of them have a traditional

1141
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:04,450
mechanical cylinder for their override

1142
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:06,340
which ironically quick-set who's got

1143
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,259
like the market like the kevo right like

1144
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,900
all their that all their systems

1145
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,880
there their fallback cylinder is the

1146
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,970
quick-set smart key which is actually

1147
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,280
not easy to pick there's a decode for it

1148
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:20,620
so farmer freak made a tool years ago

1149
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,020
and then lock masters weaponized it it's

1150
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,089
a little optic tool our friend Shane he

1151
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:27,520
made a manual decoder tool so you can

1152
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:29,020
decode the smart key but it's not easy

1153
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,680
to pick at all you need to have done

1154
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:34,509
your homework so yeah do I think that I

1155
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,730
don't like the idea that more and more

1156
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,470
people are getting complacent about the

1157
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,880
idea that while technology is more

1158
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:43,720
gooder because it's got the ones and

1159
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,670
zeros like modernity for modernity sake

1160
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,129
undermines a lot of security it's why we

1161
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,780
see a lot of unnecessary electronic lock

1162
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:52,750
upgrades in corporate America and

1163
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,160
corporate space for a home user like if

1164
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,960
you got a keypad lock and you get you

1165
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,200
know like I think the threat model there

1166
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,570
is if your kid is six and and they keep

1167
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,160
losing the key at school that's probably

1168
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:05,980
the bigger risk than just putting this

1169
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,259
weird keypad lock on so again as Lisa

1170
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,490
points out a threat modeling how are we

1171
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,140
doing here we're gonna only try this

1172
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:13,629
this one last time if it works it works

1173
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:18,020
if it doesn't who gives a

1174
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:21,470
yes talk to me have I ever gotten

1175
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:25,160
arrested on the job no I have never

1176
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:27,620
actually gotten like proper caught on

1177
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,029
the job the most caught we've ever

1178
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,089
gotten has been a job where we were

1179
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:35,570
instructed specifically to go loud like

1180
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:37,190
really loud like we destroyed doors and

1181
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,630
that still didn't plate in like I'm

1182
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:41,420
gonna give a talk in New Orleans

1183
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:43,520
in June about this and like they still

1184
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,170
didn't actually stop us so at some point

1185
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,850
I just started doing stupid like I

1186
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:50,060
stole a security cart and I drove it

1187
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:52,190
around and I spoke and like they started

1188
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:54,440
following me and I just but like a golf

1189
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:56,540
cart can go place as a car can so like

1190
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,130
six mobile units are trying to follow me

1191
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,910
through parking lots and through like

1192
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:04,070
then I took a bike and in the end the

1193
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:06,259
guy like eventually I stopped because

1194
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:07,880
everyone on my team is like hey like we

1195
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,350
a finally they caught they figured out

1196
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:14,270
they think something's up just butts and

1197
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:15,770
the end the exercise yeah it was really

1198
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,210
cool because everyone else on the team

1199
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:18,950
was getting into other places it was

1200
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,080
only when a supervisor you getting a

1201
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:23,990
preview of my sans talked a supervisor

1202
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:26,540
came in from off-site and he was like

1203
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:28,819
bike guy maybe a distraction cancel all

1204
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,320
bark guard tours stop touring like get

1205
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,290
down stairwell this is still really hot

1206
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,490
and they let that cool off yeah and then

1207
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,660
eventually they're like we're like

1208
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,919
alright they pretty much know what's up

1209
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,600
like everyone just let you slow yourself

1210
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,190
get caught so we get you know I got

1211
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,740
caught I got stopped I took off the bike

1212
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,240
and I said no the guys like I need you

1213
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,229
to stop going anywhere right now because

1214
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,390
they've been like driving around this

1215
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,290
parking lot I'm like I'm not gonna know

1216
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,120
where the bikes there what do you want

1217
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:52,550
from me and I just so caught and he was

1218
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,509
he was ready to like tackle me and it

1219
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:55,760
the fact that I was like what do you

1220
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:58,390
want what do you need I'm fine

1221
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,060
is there something wrong sir

1222
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:02,529
it's like what do you actually do did

1223
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,090
you just drive around like do you take a

1224
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:06,880
 like yeah was I not supposed to take

1225
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:08,290
a cart I thought there for anybody but

1226
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,940
then you talk through and then I was

1227
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,020
like he's like well I think you need to

1228
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,700
have a you need to have a conversation

1229
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,710
with Ellie they're on their way I was

1230
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,120
like okay would it would it upset any of

1231
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,250
you if I reach into my pocket because

1232
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,720
I'm gonna give you something and I'm so

1233
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,360
you know you always ask because you

1234
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:25,209
never mean I'm I'm white so like let's

1235
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,260
all imagine probably okay but I was like

1236
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,850
you should probably just take a look at

1237
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,080
this and I gave him the it wasn't even a

1238
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:30,610
real letter because we travel with the

1239
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,200
fake letter which says like this is a

1240
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:34,450
test and believe everything this person

1241
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,910
says you know he was like he looked at

1242
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:38,560
his part he's like we were right it's an

1243
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,240
exercise I was like all right should I

1244
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,930
go he's like no don't go we have to

1245
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,759
still talk to some of them but yeah that

1246
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,770
was that was about the closest our team

1247
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,560
ever got and that was after like a lot

1248
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:53,680
of crazy crazy crap so I don't know if

1249
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,420
we can see on camera the tip of this key

1250
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,190
you can almost see there's a lot of

1251
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,830
little flashing way out at the tip of

1252
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:03,130
this key that would keep it from going

1253
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:06,640
all the way in but I'm gonna try just to

1254
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:07,840
use my little impression and if it works

1255
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,879
it works this again

1256
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,890
this shouldn't be a discouragement for

1257
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,860
anyone to try this should be an

1258
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:26,830
encouragement for any of you to go ahead

1259
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:29,560
and try this later so remember don't

1260
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:31,930
don't do what Bonnie don't does don't

1261
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,299
start drinking and eating and like you

1262
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,770
don't want like harmful chemicals in

1263
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,290
your food if you go get late-night

1264
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:40,210
snacks don't go back to the CTF room and

1265
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,950

00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:52,470
