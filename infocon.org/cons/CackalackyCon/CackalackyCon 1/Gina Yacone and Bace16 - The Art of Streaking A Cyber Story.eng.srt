streaking I don't really want to see

49
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,200
that practice on your own stuff I got a

50
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,300
laser pointer in my pocket I am gonna

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,010
use it because when you practice on your

52
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,370
own stuff that should be assumed for any

53
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,780
presentation the base 16 does a few

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,330
things expressed sorrow not our

55
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,300
employers or any other group and if this

56
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,709
disclaimer seems familiar a little bit

57
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,170
of a watermark down there you know where

58
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:37,360
it's from

59
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:45,069
so a little bit of the history of

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:46,209
women's streaking in sports so we're

61
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,518
gonna start with the history of women's

62
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,130
streaking in sports you know women

63
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,080
they're able to get away with a lot you

64
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,519
know and as a straight woman I'm able to

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,959
appreciate the female body and the

66
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,549
athletic skills it takes to pull

67
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,650
something like that off so let's take a

68
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:02,920
much closer look and examine that

69
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,590
history just kidding we're gonna be

70
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,640
talking about Mark Roberts the man the

71
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,470
myth the streaker so he saw a news

72
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,048
report about a female streaker at the

73
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,390
1993 rugby sevens game in Hong Kong and

74
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,100
after a bet in a bar he went naked in

75
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,559
front of the crowd himself the very next

76
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:26,140
day and as of today Mark Roberts has

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,510
streaked 565 times in 23 countries it's

78
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,018
a lot of running like how many miles is

79
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:35,078
he getting so some of his career

80
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:38,680
highlights include a Mr Universe contest

81
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:41,200
and this world contest the Running of

82
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,739
the Bulls in Pamplona a synchronized

83
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,780
swimming World Championship

84
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:52,540
Belfast Dog Show 2006 Olympic men's

85
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,170
curling competition and a multitude of

86
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,170
soccer games

87
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:04,250
okay let's talk about park a little

88
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:06,840
further so this was mark last year 2018

89
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,190
what's interesting about this is it

90
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,190
occurred in the Olympics

91
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:17,549
he's wearing a monkey on his junk

92
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,770
it's a chunky monkey with the tutu so

93
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:23,909
let's talk about this Olympic event

94
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:25,950
so was happening in South Korea in 2018

95
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,560
in South Korea there was a lot of

96
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,940
political stuff going on North Korea was

97
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,370
mad at South Korea or I guess South

98
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,050
Korea was mad at North Korea US was mad

99
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,600
at North Korea and North Korea was mad

100
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,520
at us the u.s. was mad at Iran so what

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,150
did that mean that meant there was a lot

102
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:46,280
of nuclear stress that was happening so

103
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:48,840
South Korea created the most militarized

104
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:53,580
security event for the Olympics they

105
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,940
mobilized 50,000 soldiers in addition to

106
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,950
regular security professionals so if you

107
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,500
think about the Olympics in general

108
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,870
there are so many venues that you have

109
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,720
to protect just think about that the

110
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,340
people the places here they're worrying

111
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,580
about missile attacks and things like

112
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,150
that

113
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,070
so and that's besides all of the IOT

114
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,820
devices and everything else that's going

115
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:21,830
on so what does Mark Roberts do he gets

116
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,770
a ticket to the South Korea Olympics and

117
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:29,280
after the 1,000 meter male speed skate

118
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:32,039
he just takes off his clothes and runs

119
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,809
out there on this one he's making a

120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:39,180
political statement by peace and love

121
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:41,070
but as you can see it's interesting on

122
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,220
how this gentleman can get through some

123
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,080
really really high secure events and you

124
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,410
probably can imagine that South Korea

125
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,740
president was not happy oh and I don't

126
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,680
know what I just did okay so how does

127
00:05:52,740 --> 00:06:00,960
Mark Roberts achieve his epic success

128
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,960
like how does this work so timing timing

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,460
is really important and so when Mark

130
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,700
Roberts when you listen to his history

131
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,780
and his background he actually attempted

132
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,830
a Super Bowl

133
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,950
in San Diego in 2003 and he failed he

134
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,810
couldn't get past the cop and he spent

135
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,940
all this money to get out there and just

136
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,950
couldn't get in but he says that that

137
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,320
was a blessing in disguise because one

138
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:28,890
it allowed him to prepare for future

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,040
events what was his first course of

140
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,180
action to prepare for the next Super

141
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,320
Bowl that was going to be in Dallas

142
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,960
Texas it was finding a lawyer to sponsor

143
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,719
him so he found a lawyer and literally

144
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,849
put on his chest like better call Saul

145
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,450
or something like that some type of

146
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:51,060
motto on his chest because this this

147
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,580
lawyer said just get arrested I'll get

148
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,620
you out just wear my my marketing

149
00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:00,840
material so he became in a way a

150
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,370
marketing genius after this but this

151
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,080
event here which we're going to talk

152
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,240
about when you're thinking the Superbowl

153
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,609
it's kind of like the Olympics the

154
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,010
Olympics has a lot of stuff going on and

155
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,410
like ameno sorry the Superbowl there's a

156
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:16,349
lot of synchrony that has to happen when

157
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,030
you're going through you have to go

158
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,380
through you know usually metal detectors

159
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,469
sometimes you have to have pat downs

160
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,320
things like that Mark Roberts what his

161
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,919
second course of action was to do was to

162
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,979
get a tailor to make stripper pants the

163
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:35,849
strip off pants you know and he also

164
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,159
ordered a referee costume so he wore in

165
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,169
a baggy baggy sweatshirt so he's coming

166
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,930
into the Super Bowl wearing oversized

167
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:46,130
clothes and he has a great personality

168
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,419
so he goes up to the front of the

169
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:53,190
security and the security guard was like

170
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:55,859
dude what's up with those pants and he's

171
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,229
like oh I have a I have a skin disorder

172
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,450
yeah I have a skin disorder and I need

173
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,390
to be able to put lotion on my legs I

174
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,060
have some type of eczema security guard

175
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,580
bought it he thought on his feet he was

176
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,760
able to pivot he was able to overcome

177
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:16,050
objections and that makes for a very

178
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:19,260
good social engineer so he gets through

179
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,000
the security he walks his way down he

180
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,620
maneuvers his way down using his

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,430
personality and wit

182
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,310
he gets down to the sideline and you can

183
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,800
see how big I mean a football field is

184
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,990
and there's usually that big wall that

185
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,700
you have to jump down to get there so to

186
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,470
even get up front you usually have those

187
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,360
ticket people but you have to get

188
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:42,540
through so just think about all of those

189
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,140
layers of security kind of that defense

190
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,790
in depth

191
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,470
you have your security you have your

192
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,390
checkpoint you have this checkpoint you

193
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,490
have that checkpoint he's getting

194
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,490
through meticulously all these he's

195
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:57,960
making it a joke in a way so he jumps

196
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:00,510
down to the ground and then races across

197
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:25,110
the field and we're going to show you

198
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:25,620
what he did the short clip he's epic

199
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:34,350
right

200
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:43,980
he's just epic so thanks for going with

201
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:46,830
that very okay so mark Roberts also had

202
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,750
his has to surrender his passport and

203
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,860
for English football events he's been

204
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,140
streaking way too many times he's been

205
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,350
banned from so many events he's done all

206
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,640
this stuff he always know he doesn't

207
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,660
actually have an exit plan though he

208
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,240
always knows he's going to get arrested

209
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,670
or detained and he has spent nights in

210
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,290
jail completely naked and he spends a

211
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,979
lot of money and fees and things like

212
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:11,819
that but he does not have an exit plan

213
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:18,720
but what can Mark Roberts teach us about

214
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:20,670
security don't wear clothes exactly so

215
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,430
the importance of timing and preparation

216
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,339
is probably the biggest one so gathering

217
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:29,310
your data knowing your target is one of

218
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,030
those things for for me it's about

219
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,099
patience

220
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,510
so not just about timing when you're

221
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,920
doing anything regarding social

222
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,980
engineering or trying to

223
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,469
you know get to an end of something but

224
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,450
really having the patience to do your

225
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:47,110
due diligence so let's get into detail

226
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,550
about that

227
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:54,490
so what to do one I'm going to use this

228
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,439
pointer to is understanding your task

229
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,870
this is probably one of the most

230
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,180
critical things that most people don't

231
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:05,680
understand or appreciate what does your

232
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:08,260
client want or what is your goal what is

233
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,120
your payload those are all things you

234
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,670
have to think about then you have to

235
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,949
think what's in scope and what's out of

236
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,420
scope and the reason for that is you

237
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:18,790
don't want to waste your time money and

238
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,389
resources by going down a rabbit hole

239
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,969
that you don't need to per se so and

240
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:27,579
also when you're go when you actually

241
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,220
understand your task it helps you with

242
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:33,930
the analyzation part of it the analytics

243
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,000
part so different types of tasks

244
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,609
different types of tasks okay so for

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,220
Mark Roberts it's really just to run

246
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,570
free right he wants to be naked he wants

247
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,860
to make opinion and he wants to probably

248
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,420
make a couple million dollars because

249
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,839
that's how much he's he's raised in

250
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,939
promotions but for real life a lot of

251
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,279
times for investigation it might be a

252
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,529
CEO looking to understand how they're a

253
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,480
soft target and I'll explain that a

254
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,579
little bit more but it may be a company

255
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,620
looking to acquire another company so

256
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:05,560
doing your due diligence on that company

257
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,290
it could be hiring and recruiting if

258
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,609
you're you know an HR looking at your

259
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,939
candidates doing your due diligence

260
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,699
they're of course ethical pen testing

261
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,360
you know doing your research before you

262
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:22,089
actually dive in become a subject matter

263
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,029
expert on your target so when I was an

264
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:29,019
investigator I would have dossiers on

265
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:32,079
every one of my witnesses every one an

266
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:33,790
example was it's I know it's kind of a

267
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,149
sad example but it's something that I

268
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,730
did also I would have dossiers on judges

269
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:41,800
I would find out what their interests

270
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,720
were what their family's interests were

271
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,579
and everything and we would use that

272
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,040
because we wanted to know how judges

273
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:51,380
would rule on certain issues

274
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,319
do they have biases people have biases

275
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,660
right so when you're looking at your

276
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,459
target and say you have a case that

277
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,579
that's potentially a vehicular homicide

278
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:04,609
that has to deal with alcohol and your

279
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:05,829
judge has sponsored mad which is the

280
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,870
Mothers Against Drunk Driving

281
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:11,959
potentially they have a bias so you're

282
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:14,240
able to recruit your judge there that's

283
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,579
one of one of my stories that I have but

284
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,430
every witness I would find I would

285
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:21,410
create a dossier on them and I we called

286
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,810
it a black book or I would use OneNote

287
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,459
and create topics up on top some topics

288
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,589
most of the information I would never

289
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:30,469
use but there are some gems that really

290
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:32,240
would help me win cases you know oh

291
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,290
thank you be use for bad actors too of

292
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,430
course

293
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,689
and there's also a very strong fine line

294
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,560
so I want you guys to realize this

295
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:44,420
between knowing that you're working

296
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,508
towards something versus becoming a

297
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,910
stalker okay it's very easy to become

298
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:51,620
OCD and think that you're gonna find

299
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,829
your information so know when to stop

300
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,350
and when to see a therapist okay for the

301
00:13:54,829 --> 00:14:00,229
next one it's collecting data right

302
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,149
there collect all of the things all of

303
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,389
them you don't know what you're going to

304
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:08,510
use and you by the end your entire topic

305
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:10,670
may pivot somewhere else and what you

306
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,630
want to do for that is you also want to

307
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,860
have local copies of the information

308
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,040
just to verify that there haven't been

309
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,389
altered or deleted or anything like that

310
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,349
so you want to make sure you have local

311
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:27,889
copies not just the URLs the next part

312
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:30,290
is the most one of the most important

313
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:33,829
part so what separates an investigator

314
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,639
OSEM professional is really that you're

315
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:36,579
not a Googler

316
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,079
you're actually creating that analysis

317
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,729
okay you're not just finding things

318
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:44,000
you're actually putting those you're

319
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:48,500
putting the dots together and that's

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,529
that's vital so you have to state why

321
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,089
the data is important to the task at

322
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:55,459
hand and why it's important for your

323
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:58,069
target or what it is for that that

324
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:59,869
initial task yes it also helps you

325
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:01,910
demonstrate to the client that you

326
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,970
understood the task

327
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,850
I would also sort data into a useful

328
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,310
field a non useful field in a follow-up

329
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,380
field that's that scoping you don't have

330
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,310
a lot of potentially time money and

331
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,370
resources

332
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,689
so when you're thinking about stuff that

333
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,700
you may not have you may be running out

334
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,650
of time because the client only has

335
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,750
given you so many hours or so much money

336
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,699
it might be something where you say to a

337
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,750
client I have to follow up on this or

338
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,050
you may have to go to the courthouse for

339
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,990
this so but that analysis makes you

340
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,329
different from a Googler also when do

341
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,990
you have enough information for the task

342
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:41,150
so if your report is lacking is your is

343
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,610
the information that you've that you're

344
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,860
putting and you found is it relevant is

345
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,010
it accurate is it objective is it

346
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,380
credible do you need a follow-up and

347
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,390
then that report writing that report

348
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,380
writing is vital

349
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:59,569
a lot of assent reports that I see a lot

350
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,060
of times don't prove the negative and

351
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,310
what I mean by that is if I'm a soft

352
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,530
target I want to know that you weren't

353
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,390
able to find the city the street I was

354
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,370
born on or that you know the street all

355
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,710
those security questions or what high

356
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,230
school I went to or what that mascot was

357
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,089
or my date of birth you want to also

358
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,300
prove the negatives in the report if you

359
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:26,420
can't find out those security questions

360
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:28,550
put that you weren't able to find it so

361
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,250
to be effective you must target a victim

362
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:34,069
so phase one or caucuses I can't still

363
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:37,089
pronounce that for cause is this because

364
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:40,790
yes I've been drinking establish trust

365
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:42,890
exploit trust this is a Jason I can I

366
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,719
also can't do grammar exploit trust

367
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:51,350
being able to respond to common

368
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:54,770
objections and exit run and depart this

369
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:57,290
next one be a sock puppet okay so you

370
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:01,250
want to go in stealth mode when you're

371
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:04,099
researching okay why because your target

372
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,500
you really don't know yet your target

373
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,540
may have valuable information so for

374
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,869
example say your company was hit with a

375
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:15,230
phishing attack that you don't know the

376
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:18,589
sophistication of enemy number one there

377
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,750
so when you're researching them one you

378
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,359
may have some information like an email

379
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,519
or whatever and you start googling them

380
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:27,769
you have to pay attention to what

381
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,669
profile you're giving out there so for

382
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:33,039
example I Jeana yacon don't I know if

383
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:35,799
you're looking at me on LinkedIn

384
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,190
it shows me that you're looking at me

385
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:41,750
but other ways for you know bad actors

386
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,760
to use is your browsers

387
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,380
I know your browsers I can I can exploit

388
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,330
what browsers you're using or your

389
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,639
locations or things so you want to make

390
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,928
sure you're clear your history and your

391
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:53,570
cache and all your passwords and

392
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:55,970
everything you want to become stealth

393
00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:00,408
you also want to create a personality

394
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:04,460
that has content and that is has

395
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:07,429
connections that seems relevant now

396
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,200
again here's another fine line you also

397
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:11,450
don't want to be something that would

398
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,919
violate the law for example you don't

399
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,149
wanna be a lawyer because somebody may

400
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:16,340
think you're practicing law without a

401
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:17,500
license you don't want to be a cop you

402
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,418
don't want to be an emergency

403
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,179
EMS agent those are all things that you

404
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:27,470
will get arrested for also what's

405
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:29,659
interesting about a sock puppet is when

406
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,820
you're testifying if you have to testify

407
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:34,929
and I've had to testify many times

408
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:38,990
before they can use using a sock puppet

409
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:41,480
against you so and what I mean by that

410
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,970
is a lot of times you are violating the

411
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,889
terms and services of the website that

412
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,380
you're on because you're using an

413
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:50,090
alter-ego you're not using yourself so

414
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,860
one it's your gathered the information

415
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:57,019
under false pretense and if then it

416
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,360
still gets before a to a jury that

417
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:01,399
opposing counsel is gonna make you look

418
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,199
like you were a predator and that you

419
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:07,399
were trying and they'll try to hurt your

420
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,460
credibility so clean your act up if you

421
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:14,299
are doing open source intelligence use

422
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,700
proxies use tor wisely a lot of times

423
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:19,490
people will say guess tor is the end-all

424
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,570
be-all that's not necessarily true the

425
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:25,070
exit tor nodes can leave fingerprints

426
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,779
just like browsers and things like that

427
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,010
so that's when you have to know your

428
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:37,669
victim and kind of

429
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:42,789
where you're at with that yet recon

430
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:46,690
recognizance recognizes recognizance

431
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:49,129
recognizance it's fine it's fine

432
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,769
okay so collection of data so these are

433
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,990
some really cool you know websites that

434
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,519
it's easy a lot of these are very common

435
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,519
and you're like you know I already know

436
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:02,000
those types of things right but it's

437
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:04,429
this is one of those for doing

438
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,730
investigations it's it's also to create

439
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:09,740
a repeatable method so it's the same

440
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:13,220
websites that you go to but you go to

441
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,049
them nonetheless with each other project

442
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,299
that you have but these are some of the

443
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:19,070
favorites that I use public record

444
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,149
besides dumpster diving and if you don't

445
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,510
think that I have not been in some

446
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:25,699
dumpsters you're dreadfully wrong but

447
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,340
public records is probably my favorite

448
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,529
so public records is if you go to the

449
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,559
courthouse a lot of times there are

450
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,929
states that have stuff online and you a

451
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,500
lot of times the Osen professional does

452
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:41,870
not go that extra mile to really go to

453
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,820
the public record the clerk or court and

454
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,350
look for public records look for

455
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:50,830
speeding tickets look for look for

456
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,830
anything gather that intelligence there

457
00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:06,340
don't underestimate my ability to find

458
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:11,200
 out whoa wait now mm just kidding

459
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:14,480
why clear notes are important okay so

460
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,539
sorry so you're explaining how you got

461
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,809
to an end results okay having notes

462
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:23,419
while you go one it leaves the lasting

463
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:26,510
impression on your on your client you

464
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:29,000
may need to testify and so they may ask

465
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,519
you how did you get to that document and

466
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,399
a lot of times those documents could be

467
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,379
in secure locations so that means that

468
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:40,428
you they're trying to accuse you of of

469
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:40,899
hacking into their network so you have

470
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:45,190
to

471
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:48,040
create a clear method to that so having

472
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:51,400
clear notes is just so vital also again

473
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:54,610
that if it could be deleted or altered

474
00:21:51,400 --> 00:22:03,580
so notes equals credibility record

475
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:05,169
everything now so yeah when you trust a

476
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,860
person you either have a friend or you

477
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:11,470
have a life lesson so Trust is just a

478
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,510
tool it depends on how you use it it can

479
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,280
be used for bad purposes for

480
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,220
manipulation or it can be used for

481
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,040
influence so manipulation exploits the

482
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,960
trust that has been built that's a win

483
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,330
for the manipulator and a loss for the

484
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,130
target it destroys the relationship when

485
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,199
it's found out however very good

486
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,170
manipulators can keep the exploitation

487
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,640
relationship going for long term think

488
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,650
of that boss that you had that made you

489
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,050
leave a company they probably exploited

490
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,880
you or destroyed trust with you and they

491
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,950
only managed to keep it going until you

492
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,120
found your next job or got out of there

493
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:48,070
or whatever influence on the other hand

494
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,229
utilize this trust for good purposes and

495
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,270
it's a win for the influencer and a win

496
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,030
for the target it builds a relationship

497
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,850
and continues the trust when it's done

498
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,500
in a group setting you get a community

499
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,419
full of active groups and conferences

500
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,890
like when you have too many speakers

501
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,600
apply for a conference and you can't

502
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,730
take them all so you talked them into

503
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,399
speaking to another group or at another

504
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:14,100
conference besides call for papers is

505
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:18,580
open so how can you exploit that trust

506
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,860
you can exploit it over the phone using

507
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,139
fishing or smishing contacting

508
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,709
individuals of a company and persuading

509
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:29,530
them to divulge confidential information

510
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,760
online with fishing or gathering

511
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,010
information through the use of online

512
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,350
chat sessions emails or any other

513
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,690
methods that your company may use to

514
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,580
interact with online this is a little

515
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:47,560
bit of the cyber part of the talk

516
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:49,860
baiting and quid pro quo I do mess up

517
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,860
words

518
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:56,559
these are both offers we're baiting that

519
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,110
I've talked about before refers to goods

520
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,700
quid pro Crowe is for services if

521
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,709
someone is tempting you and the deal

522
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,570
seems like a loss for them and a win for

523
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,190
you it's likely one of these and they'll

524
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,860
expect something from you later that

525
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,340
puts you at a loss and puts the

526
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,719
manipulator gives them a win

527
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,970
there's also reverse social engineering

528
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,230
which is a method where the attacker can

529
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,910
get their victims call them back

530
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,820
pertaining to you something an attacker

531
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:25,130
may have previously asked for like the

532
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,659
quid pro quo since the victim is calling

533
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,270
the attacker the victim is already at

534
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:38,480
the attackers mercy and this takes a lot

535
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:40,370
of reconnaissance persuasion so

536
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,990
persuading somebody to give you

537
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,659
confidential information either by

538
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,490
convincing them you are someone who can

539
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,230
be trusted or by simply just asking for

540
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:52,309
it it's amazing what you can get when

541
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:55,660
you just ask for it so ok so how to

542
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:58,910
develop a solid pretexting campaign so

543
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:01,760
pretexting okay this is something that a

544
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:04,970
lot of companies utilize to kind of fish

545
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,340
their employees it's a different

546
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:10,690
different way it's also trying to get

547
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:13,580
the crown jewels so this could be

548
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:16,429
administrative passwords or different

549
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,490
vital information that the company has

550
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:22,429
so a lot of it really just stems from

551
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,620
that long long slide that I had

552
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,360
regarding the cycle you know really

553
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,239
going through and understanding your

554
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,799
task collecting the data analyzing you

555
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,799
know think before you speak

556
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,679
really it's all about preparation so

557
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,720
planning is critical you really when

558
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,450
you're trying to develop a pretext

559
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,480
campaign with a client you want to find

560
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:47,179
out from them what their pain points are

561
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,700
we can put our own biases on companies

562
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,470
and think that we know what their

563
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,750
problems are their client Oh at their

564
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,360
office but that might not be the case

565
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:59,020
they may have other weak links that you

566
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:03,080
just don't know so you have to ask

567
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:05,600
listening and asking is vital

568
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:09,529
developing a backstory using your sock

569
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,748
pocket sock puppet is critical become

570
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:14,840
that sock puppet but developing your

571
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:17,450
backstory I would have two or three

572
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,908
because usually your first one is really

573
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,129
really good and if you use it on one

574
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:24,649
person and it's they may tail the rest

575
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:27,019
of their office with that but that

576
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:28,399
potential attack was so you have to kind

577
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:30,950
of have a couple in your in your back

578
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:34,189
pocket and you also need to be able to

579
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:36,440
pivot pivoting is vital

580
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:39,409
this is overcoming objections you have

581
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,989
to be a good salesperson in many ways to

582
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:45,529
develop to pull off a pretexting

583
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:47,109
campaign understand the law so like pen

584
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:49,609
test you know make sure you're getting

585
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:53,619
approval from your client that they know

586
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:59,899
that you are pretexting their employees

587
00:26:53,619 --> 00:27:02,600
so exit run and depart okay so that's

588
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:06,109
four pretexting you know get the crown

589
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:10,009
jewels get in get the out seriously

590
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:11,600
that is it marks exit plan Mark Roberts

591
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:15,139
his exit plan he knows he's going to get

592
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,709
arrested so he's not going to depart he

593
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:26,209
is gonna run for sure but he's not going

594
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:29,720
to get out so let's go back to mark so

595
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:33,169
this is at the open in st. Andrews John

596
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:37,369
Daly just won the open and he is

597
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:40,309
embracing his wife on the 18th hole how

598
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:42,168
excited ream come true this is what his

599
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:46,039
photos his success photos look like

600
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:53,499
there's there's a mark displaying his

601
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:58,549
19th hole so what makes him successful

602
00:27:53,499 --> 00:28:00,830
one his personality a lot of the best

603
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:03,109
social engineers have really good

604
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:05,960
personalities and are relatable when

605
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:08,359
they talk to people on the phone they

606
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,419
find common interests sadly they use

607
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,540
those interest and to turn them on the

608
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:14,220
side and

609
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,760
get the get the information that they

610
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:20,580
yield but they utilize people's

611
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,680
weaknesses they use people and their

612
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:28,260
vulnerabilities to prey upon them

613
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,810
this was Wilmington so you could see

614
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:34,040
here he had perfect form if that was the

615
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,040
Olympics he would have gotten a ten

616
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:47,600
where is it right there she's got a

617
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,270
full-frontal yes

618
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,310
okay so understand mark understands his

619
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:56,280
perimeter so if we're talking about this

620
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:59,460
mark has no exit plan which makes things

621
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:04,200
easy but I want you to think about your

622
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:06,540
work at home do you have what is your

623
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,160
access control look like do you have

624
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,379
defense in depth in terms of your

625
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,640
physical security so you can see here

626
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,510
these are the different layers this is

627
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,570
not the greatest image that I can find

628
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,400
online but it gives you that idea

629
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,350
what are your roadblocks in terms of

630
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,260
your company what you should be looking

631
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,610
at now granted if mark is coming into

632
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,510
town he's gonna get through and he's

633
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,850
going to be streaking through your

634
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,100
reception area it's gonna be glorious

635
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:34,560
but if you think about it do you think

636
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,689
that mark just runs right on the fields

637
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,580
or do you think he enjoys the game for a

638
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:42,480
while do you think he enjoyed that

639
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,129
thousand-meter speed skate probably he

640
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,980
sat there and enjoyed being in the

641
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:49,140
Olympics enjoyed he the full first half

642
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,500
of the Super Bowl he waited patiently

643
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:56,220
for his time bad actors will do the same

644
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:58,650
too they will learn your perimeter going

645
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,800
at it from a technical perspective

646
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:03,600
that's why it's important if in terms of

647
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,520
your outside but in terms of your

648
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,280
insight to also have defense in depth

649
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,770
so of course machines fail people make

650
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:14,850
mistakes constantly it's widely

651
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:17,310
understood but very undervalued so you

652
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,850
have to have that technical controls in

653
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:23,909
place so of course that IDs that IPS

654
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,530
your firewalls you know your sim if you

655
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,409
have MDR

656
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:31,950
those type of tools endpoint protection

657
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:34,950
having endpoints you have to think we're

658
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:37,770
in a new age and so there's a lot of

659
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:41,419
stuff that Mark and other people can

660
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:48,950
teach us that apply to your everyday

661
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:48,950
protection of your environment Susan

662
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:58,110
yeah so like we have all been victims of

663
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,610
some sort of social engineering it

664
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,379
doesn't have to be at a work event it

665
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:04,439
could be the girl or guy who wanted a

666
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,000
free drink from your favorite bar the

667
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,740
social engineers goal is to trick

668
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,919
someone into giving them what they want

669
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:13,260
by preying on basic human nature an

670
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,070
organization the social engineer will

671
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,600
take advantage of the very

672
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:18,360
characteristics that make us a good

673
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,969
employees characteristics such as being

674
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,100
helpful we train our employees to ensure

675
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,990
customer satisfaction and as a result

676
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,399
employees want to be helpful which can

677
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,350
lead to them giving away too much

678
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,299
information

679
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,309
we should not victim shame though but

680
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,710
instead use it as a way to educate them

681
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,760
in a responsible manner studies have

682
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,650
shown that when people are under

683
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,690
pressure to not make mistakes they

684
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,669
become too on guard and actually make it

685
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,309
makes them distracted so they they end

686
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:46,860
up making actually more mistakes so this

687
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:48,178
is why with your companies phishing

688
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,668
campaign and when you have the

689
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:55,140
auto-replies go out for reporting a fish

690
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:57,679
they report that as a fish 15 times by

691
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,679
the same person

692
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:03,809
human false positives terrible so if you

693
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,610
have to create a culture where

694
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,500
management can be trusted job

695
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,689
responsibilities can be safely discussed

696
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,330
and reporting fishing ends in a lesson

697
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,799
instead of a punishment people are more

698
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,590
likely to trust themselves and their

699
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,179
guests gut instincts so that leads to

700
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:21,299
more fish being reported and dealt with

701
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,580
appropriately so education and open

702
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,770
discussion is key so keep the

703
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,270
conversation open and there's no need

704
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,610
for clearance when you have confidence

705
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:32,658
so thank you Mark Roberts for inspiring
