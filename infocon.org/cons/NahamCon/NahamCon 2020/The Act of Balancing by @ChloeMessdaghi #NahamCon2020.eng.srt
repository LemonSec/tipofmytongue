00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,810
active balance and what I want you to do

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:20,050
is take a deep breath in and then a deep

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:23,050

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,229
security when I'm not doing that I'm an

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,320
ethical hacker advocate meaning that I

33
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:43,929
do whatever it takes to make the

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,580
community better by asking the question

35
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,080
how can I make this better and then

36
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,420
connecting with other folks so that

37
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,460
usually means getting us rights or

38
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,400
making sure that it's a safe space for

39

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,610
on Twitter and Instagram so what I want

73
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,340
you to do is sit back relax and I'm

74
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,780
going to take you through some scenarios

75
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,760
imagine you're driving this car right

76
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,769
now and you feel so overwhelmed and and

77
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,690
like you feel like this sense of

78
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,900
emptiness perhaps we're just feeling

79
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,420
like just too much happening all at once

80
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:44,640
and that when you're trying on the

81
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:47,679
highway you think for that one second

82
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,920
should I look in my side mirror when

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,329
merging because if I get a consonant

84
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,369
like if something happens to me that

85
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:56,319
means I'm not responsible for that

86
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,820
project tomorrow or I don't have to do

87
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,679
this I don't have to feel so trapped

88
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,560
or better yet how do you guys have ever

89
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,350
been in this situation here in from your

90
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,480
computer you have an inbox and it used

91
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,060
to take you maybe a couple of minutes to

92
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,000
respond to an email but now it's taking

93
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,110
10 minutes maybe more maybe takes

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,899
meeting you at hours

95
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,030
maybe even days and then every time you

96
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:29,440
go to your inbox you feel this dreaded

97
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:31,239
sense this is too much or say you've

98
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,880
been in this situation before you have

99
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,220
friends family colleagues they're

100
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,350
texting you calling you wanting to talk

101
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,990
with you but you just can't pick up the

102
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,520
phone or you just can't respond and the

103
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,840
reason for that is you're either too

104
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,820
busy or the other thing is that you feel

105
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,340
like they're gonna ask you for something

106
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,400
and even calling them back or text them

107
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:58,409
that ask of its own and it becomes

108
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,409
overwhelming at the same time

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,100
what about this have you been in

110
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,169
situations where you just feel like your

111
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,720
emotions are all over the place in a

112
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:13,560
sense that you could easily get angry or

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,360
easily get sad and you don't understand

114
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,780
why you're suddenly feeling like this

115
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,910
sudden urge of sentence or anger these

116
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,640
extreme emotions you feel like you're

117
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,760
overwhelmed and you might reach for

118
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,610
drugs you might reach for alcohol to

119
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,670
help numb the situation because you just

120
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,620
feels this sense of maybe emptiness or

121
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,760
maybe not a sense of emptiness but this

122
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,100
feeling that you'll feel trapped and you

123
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,130
do not know what to do because you're

124
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,720
stuck in that moment and the whole world

125
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:51,240
is on your shoulders and you feel

126
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:53,540
hopeless or maybe you've had these

127
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,180
situations where you're waiting for

128
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,400
basically forever until the due date to

129
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,960
actually submit something meaning you're

130
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,030
procrastinating you're making sure that

131
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,820
you don't all more like it's not like

132
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,280
you're trying to make yourself wait to

133
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,950
last minute but you're so overwhelmed in

134
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,080
life and everything around you that when

135
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,180
anything is due the only time you're

136
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,560
able to focus as if it's actually do on

137
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,080
that day maybe a couple of hours before

138
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,350
so you procrastinate because you know

139
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,539
you cannot focus unless you do so you

140
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,060
might actually ask your friends and

141
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,850
family if they can change the event or

142
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,640
if they can post bail in an event or a

143
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,040
deadline because you feel like you

144
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,919
cannot focus you're struggling and

145
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,920
struggling to focus and you just cannot

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,950
or maybe you've had these situations

147
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,740
where you feel so tired like no matter

148
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:54,840
how many hours of sleep that you get you

149
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:58,440
just feel so so tired you can sleep for

150
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,320
days you still feel exhausted like this

151
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,630
extreme exhaustion and nothing's taken

152
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,880
away from that like you just feel like

153
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,460
you're in this moment and it's so hard

154
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,620
to focus on anything in the morning or

155
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,109
in the evening or during the day

156
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,720
because the reason is to say there's

157
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:22,260
something off and you don't feel like

158
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:27,530
yourself I'm talking to you today about

159
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:30,599
burnout the act of balance is burnout in

160
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,429
InfoSec ourselves we burnout probably

161
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,639
faster than most other industry because

162
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,919
we're on call 24/7 we're online 24/7

163
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,030
heck even the social media platform that

164
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,599
we use is Twitter which is 24/7

165
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:51,388
but what burnout is is the this feeling

166
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:54,419
that you feel like your battery if you

167
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:57,570
are a device of your own that your

168
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,120
battery is really really low and because

169
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:03,330
you can't focus you don't have enough

170
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,610
sleep you feel tired all the time

171
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,250
and nothing is helping you you're having

172
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:13,260
trouble sleeping maybe you're also

173
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:16,169
feeling maybe body aches as well so all

174
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,050
these stories I told you before was

175
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:21,599
something on those slides that is was

176
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,610
something that I've experienced I'm one

177
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,219
of those people that have had on and off

178
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,960
burnout and that's because I like to do

179
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,490
a lot of things I'm a runner I like to

180
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,469
take on many projects and then run with

181
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,580
it complete it and then I'm like oh

182
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,979
that's a great idea

183
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,200
why don't I do a new project and it's

184
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,860
something that I've been still dealing

185
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,840
with today

186
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,180
and trying to work with

187
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,710
but when we dive into this conversation

188
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,290
I just want you to know I am NOT a

189
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,630
therapist but I do work with therapists

190
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,969
occasionally when it tried to bring

191
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,370
mental health issues to the surface for

192
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,230
the hacker community so yes I do work

193
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,710
with therapists and once in a while to

194
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,360
try to help others cope or deal and to

195
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,029
strengthen themselves and feel empowered

196
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:09,040
if they're feeling isolated or alone

197
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:11,350
during this time so what is burnout so

198
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,000
burnouts a state of emotional physical

199
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,550
and mental exhaustion and caused by

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,960
excessive prolonged stress it occurs

201
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,150
when you feel overwhelmed emotionally

202
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,010
drained and unable to meet constant

203
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,900
demands in other words you feel like you

204
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,480
just want to shut down like you just

205
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,050
want to press a restart button you just

206
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,940
wanna be a reset or turn on and off

207
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,229
again

208
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,310
but the thing to note is that there's a

209
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,800
difference between burnout and stress

210
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,469
stress is something you can deal with

211
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,510
you can say for example you can take a

212
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,580
nice bubble bath and suddenly you feel a

213
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,380
little bit better or you what on the

214
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,050
elliptical or a workout machine you

215
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,910
feeling a little bit better

216
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:53,589
burnout isn't like that burnout is very

217
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:57,040
intense so if you've had any of those

218
00:09:53,589 --> 00:10:00,640
feelings that I shared previous slides

219
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,689
the very very beginning of this talk you

220
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,680
probably have been in that situation

221
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,110
before

222
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,870
many of us have believe it or not and I

223
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,900
didn't even know the term burnout I just

224
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,540
knew like something was wrong but there

225
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,770
are ways how to prevent burnout and one

226
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,199
of the things is definitely on that

227
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,960
slide which is exercise a balanced diet

228
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,570
practice good sleep can have it ask for

229
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,180
help but it really that's not the only

230
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:30,100
thing there are many other things

231
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:33,489
because we are in InfoSec and the key

232
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,310
thing here is no self-awareness is the

233
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:40,510
number one priority for you you need to

234
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:43,449
be aware that around you and how you're

235
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:47,110
feeling is impacting you you need to be

236
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:50,980
aware that if you feel very tired or

237
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,730
you're reaching for the wine or the beer

238
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,920
or tequila whatever you

239
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,760
drink usually a little bit more than

240
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,300
normal

241
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,870
please note at that moment you might be

242
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,149
entering it into another phase so to

243
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:08,389
help you through this on self-awareness

244
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:10,910
just always ask the question and my

245
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:13,190
balancing my personal life and worked

246
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,439
life because when you ask that question

247
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,050
and never able to figure out in my

248
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,870
balancing that's gonna be your dead

249
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,060
giveaway most of time burnout is caused

250
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,459
because we're not balancing our personal

251
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,489
life and our work life and right now

252
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:30,229
because of Kobe 19 we're all second side

253
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,690
we're not being able to go out and about

254
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,029
and because of that we feel stuck and

255
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,649
we're overworking ourselves we're

256
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,360
feeling more tired exhausted because

257
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,089
we're not going out and having fun with

258
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,360
their friends or seeing our family we're

259
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:46,040
stuck indoors we cannot go to all these

260
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,320
events can't go to a baby there and go

261
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,029
sit down or maybe and watch a movie just

262
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,570
to take a break there's no breaks

263
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:57,589
anymore you work in your home you work

264
00:11:53,570 --> 00:12:01,459
at home you never get your break and if

265
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:03,560
you have kids it's even it's harder

266
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:06,109
because you are always watching our kids

267
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,849
and working at the same time you never

268
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:14,029
get a break but one thing I want to

269
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,639
throw out there is so you may have heard

270
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:19,209
that I've always said you know just trap

271
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,560
your devices get rid of your devices I

272
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:23,359
don't really mean like throw it on the

273
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,689
ground kind of situation like this

274
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,630
that's not what but the one thing I do

275
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,670
recommend always for all of us in

276
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,199
emphasis is to take a break and what

277
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,839
does that mean that means turn off all

278
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:38,540
your devices get off of social media for

279
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,750
one day per week this is going to help

280
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,769
you significantly by having that one day

281
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,690
to yourself

282
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:47,329
or you're not online like you can watch

283
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:50,000
a movie TV series I don't care just get

284
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,589
off your phone get off your phone hang

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,470
out with your friend or family if you

286
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:56,870
live with someone or just read a book or

287
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,540
write a book or do something that's not

288
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,089
InfoSec real a day just get off your

289
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,490
computer this is really important get

290
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:05,279
off all your devices because you need to

291
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,759
take a break

292
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,310
at least once a week for one day it will

293
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,329
help you so much and preventing burnout

294
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:17,248
and when you're dealing with burnout the

295
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:20,430
other thing today you can do is write a

296
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:23,069
to-do list so I always carry a tablet

297
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,719
and I'll write down all the tests I need

298
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,878
to do and this can be work

299
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,559
this is giving personal life but I make

300
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,779
this list and the reason I do that is

301
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,629
because I used to deal with kind of like

302
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:35,819
insomnia once in a while because oh crap

303
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:37,889
during the night oh I have to make sure

304
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:39,569
I do this or I have to do this first

305
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:41,730
thing in the morning oh god I have to do

306
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:43,439
this oh I can't I can't have to like

307
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,999
it's and then you just keep thinking

308
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:46,740
about it and thinking about it in

309
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:50,370
reality if you actually write it down on

310
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,470
a piece of paper you free that that set

311
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,139
in your mind and this is something that

312
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,149
we all need a practice is I know that a

313
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,730
lot of people gleeful if I see the list

314
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:01,949
Chloe I'm gonna freak out because that

315
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,100
just shows how much stuff I'm working on

316
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:06,660
how much stuff I'm doing I get that I

317
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,730
understand that it's gonna stress you

318
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,639
out at first but I guarantee when you

319
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,470
cross out something is probably one of

320
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:20,430
the best feelings in the world

321
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:22,949
it's like yes this is awesome and you

322
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,870
feel a lot more relieved so just have a

323
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:27,569
to-do list and have a carry it wherever

324
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,339
you go it's gonna help you and a lot of

325
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:30,930
people that are very successful in their

326
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:35,279
life because this is something that they

327
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:37,410
do also you can write in journal as well

328
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,329
that's another thing is to write in a

329
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,699
journal but a to-do list is really

330
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:43,910
important now the other thing you need

331
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:46,439
to note is that when you are feeling

332
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,420
burnout you have a lot of emotions that

333
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:50,910
are mixed they can be very hard and

334
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,920
challenging so one of the things I want

335
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,759
to talk to you about is invest in

336
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,679
yourself

337
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,620
that means examine your personal vows

338
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,360
and goals that means is there something

339
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,529
that's missing in life is your job

340
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,870
making you happy if it's not what could

341
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:09,209
what what would be a good place for you

342
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,429
to start maybe having that weird awkward

343
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,829
conversation with your manager might be

344
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:15,250
the first art let them know hey I'm kind

345
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,979
of dealing with right now and we're

346
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,530
concern about my health I guarantee your

347
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,930
manager is gonna turn around if it

348
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,630
they're a good manager it's gonna turn I

349
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:28,569
say I've been there before take a day

350
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:31,660
off and this is the thing we need to do

351
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,850
we have to ask for help and we also have

352
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,010
to let people know because you put

353
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,480
yourself in danger if you don't let your

354
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,300
manager know that you're dealing with

355
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,600
burnout because then they're like well

356
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,819
Joe's not doing any work at all like

357
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,390
Joe's not you respond to his emails

358
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,950
really

359
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,050
he's so behind he's not being his

360
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,060
deadlines I think we should let him go

361
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,040
now the thing is that's not the

362
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,290
conversation that you're supposed to be

363
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,670
having there are signs when someone's

364
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,680
burnout when they're not responding to

365
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,800
their email sometimes or not following

366
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,109
up on a project and the deadline that's

367
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,120
something you need to know is that if

368
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,520
you are working in a work environment

369
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,310
that they don't help you or they don't

370
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,730
understand you they're even turn around

371
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,709
say hey are you doing okay I've been

372
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,540
noticing been doing this and that and I

373
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,520
just want you to know like I'm here for

374
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,020
you that's a good manager that's a

375
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,880
manager you want to keep but if you're

376
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,060
dealing with a situation where you're

377
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,380
not having that situation I think it

378
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,880
might be a good time for you to look

379
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,589
elsewhere because there are plenty of

380
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,680
companies out that they're looking to

381
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:39,130
hire someone so just keep that in mind

382
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,810
and also keep a record I always tell

383
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,460
people you know after having a

384
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,900
conversation with your boss writing down

385
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,790
an email and send it to them say I just

386
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,319
want to make sure that we had clarity

387
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,910
over this conversation that we just had

388
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,950
and there's a reason for that you want

389
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,600
to keep a paper trail in case if anytime

390
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,890
someone comes in it's like oh that

391
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,450
person's not doing anything

392
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,400
hey guess what you have that paper trail

393
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,650
or if they try to get rid of you you

394
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,970
have a paper trail it's so important to

395
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,089
keep a paper trail that's the one thing

396
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:06,699
I've learned in in my career to be

397
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:10,349
honest but the whole thing about this

398
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:13,750
investing thing is you should feel happy

399
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:16,208
yes at times you're going to be down but

400
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,339
you should feel happy when you go to

401
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,949
work you should be happy to be with your

402
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:24,310
colleagues you should be happy for the

403
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:27,069
work that you do if you don't take pride

404
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,569
in that then that's not a good place for

405
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,389
you

406
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:33,850
and it might be a hard decision to make

407
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:36,668
but sometimes you just need to make a

408
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:40,269
list and I'm not list have two sides

409
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:42,580
things about that you love about your

410
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:44,950
life things that you don't love about

411
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:48,490
your life and then see how can you make

412
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,080
that fit of course there's those major

413
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,909
tasks in our life that you know we don't

414
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,668
want to do like taxes and whatnot but I

415
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:57,690
mean that's just part of life but if it

416
00:17:54,669 --> 00:18:02,080
takes you too much and it hurts so badly

417
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:04,389
then this is something to reconsider so

418
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,439
I want the main takeaways of this very

419
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:10,330
short talk uh-hum burn out but overall

420
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,820
when you feel overwhelmed do a device

421
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,908
detox like I said do a whole day without

422
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,408
any devices without social media let

423
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:19,360
your friends and family know that you're

424
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:22,330
going offline for the day and not to

425
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,740
worry about you this is really important

426
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,649
for you and also for your loved ones to

427
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,409
know when you feel overwhelmed invest in

428
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:32,949
yourself that means heck if I'm gonna

429
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:34,629
feel better if I buy a painting kit so I

430
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,929
can start learning how to paint

431
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:40,449
so be it I will purchase it if you want

432
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:43,450
to learn how to cook take the time and

433
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,889
do so that's really important you need

434
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,440
to invest in yourself because if you

435
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:48,490
don't take care of yourself who's gonna

436
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
take care of you

437
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,879
the other thing is if you don't take

438
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,340
care of yourself how are you able to

439
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:56,049
take care of another person there's a

440
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,789
reason why when you get on the flight

441
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:01,658
and they're like the air bags come down

442
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:04,059
first cover your face then assist the

443
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:06,399
other person because you need to do that

444
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,720
you cannot take care of another person

445
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:10,899
or support another person when you're

446
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,549
not doing well yourself mentally when

447
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,799
you're feeling overwhelmed ask for help

448
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:17,740
please this is the one thing I always

449
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,139
ask people if you feel stuck isolated

450
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,879
alone talk to someone and if you don't

451
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:24,990
know who to talk to you ask your friend

452
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:28,629
ask someone you could do me on Twitter

453
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,120
there's also mental health hack I'm

454
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:34,870
sorry

455
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,399
mental health hackers which is really

456
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,428
important to get involved with there's

457
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:40,129
there's a crisis hotline chats there is

458
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,590
a zoo

459
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,240
a hotline that if you know I am feeling

460
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,980
suicide but you need to talk to some

461
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,990
because you're feeling empty or

462
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,080
overwhelmed and you're already thinking

463
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,340
well if I get out of this by like you

464
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,120
know just cross this route without

465
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,939
looking

466
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,719
call them because that means there's a

467
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,580
part of you that's feeling off-balance

468
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,440
when you feel overwhelmed write it down

469
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,300
have it to-do list write in a journal

470
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,040
those are things that are really gonna

471
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,200
help you when you feel wronged take a

472
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,360
break this is so important tell your

473
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,430
manager if you're feeling burnout tell

474
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,899
me you need to take a break because let

475
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,020
me tell you the last thing you want is a

476
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,410
breakdown or an anxiety or a panic

477
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,750
attack

478
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:23,150
so take your break and let them know you

479
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,670
need to and always keep it in writing

480
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:28,820
when you feel overwhelmed put yourself

481
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,970
first like I said before you cannot help

482
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,129
others until you feel more balanced if

483
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,540
you're feeling emotionally all over

484
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,180
place how are you gonna emotionally

485
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,970
support another person you need to put

486
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,560
yourself first at times when you feel

487
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,140
overwhelmed note that you're not alone

488
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,790
please note this you are never alone in

489
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,830
the InfoSec community we've always

490
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:53,180
supported each other and we continue to

491
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:55,850
do so but most importantly like I said

492
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,730
always ask the question am i balancing

493
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:01,370
my work and personal life if no take the

494
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,230
steps to fix it because it's only from

495
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,610
this question that you can determine

496
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:08,090
whether or not you're heading down

497
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,990
burnouts Road so if you ever feel like

498
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,340
huh

499
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,050
haven't spent too much time with my

500
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,970
family and friends or I'm not really

501
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,460
resigned to my family and friends or I

502
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:19,610
keep pushing out my family and friends

503
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:22,280
for an event question yourself

504
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,530
because those relationships are so

505
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,960
important to have in your life so do

506
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:30,800
whatever it takes to keep them well

507
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,760
that's not least work and personal life

508
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,770
should not come together if they do

509
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,760
you're already in burnout at this point

510
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:43,550

Chloe miss doggy I always I love this

523
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,960
kind of thing because it's just a breath

524
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,550
of fresh air we talk about so much tech

525
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,470
and so much software and so much code

526
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,879
but honestly at the end the day we got

527
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,650
to keep in mind our mental health them

528
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,320
and where we're feeling where we're at

529
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,180
so I love just that community just that

530
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,040
family and Chloe did an excellent job of

531
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,330
