8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,240
right now he is holding the number one

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,769
spot on the nam khan capture the flag

11
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,470
we got a few more hours if you guys want

12

to challenge him hopefully you can catch

13
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,970
him break that lead but he is an avid

14
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,129
capture the flag player he's gonna

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,290
introduce us with an incredible talk on

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:41,070
honing a new machine so without further

17
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:43,200
ado here's Big K you know everyone and

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,989
thanks following me I'm here today to

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,440
talk to you about my new project putting

20
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,209
the ship and because probably most of

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,610
you don't know about me I will start

22
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,670
with a quick prediction about myself

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,969
my name is Lucas of--but Kay I'm a

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,859
French big answer and security nerd I've

25
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,170
been playing CTF for most ten years

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,850
first with the French team expresso and

27
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,280
now with the team the flat network

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,530
society we are currently playing the

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,080
NAMM second CTF so I hope we are doing

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,869
well but I'm also an event organizer

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,380
I've wrote the spooky challenge in 2018

32
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:23,610
and CTF Ark in the Box in Singapore last

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,350
year three years ago I started doing

34
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,810
backbone cheer lots more

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,759
I was muslin ting on the French platform

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,610
yes react because everything is in

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,439
French and it was easier for me to be

38
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,140
able to explain myself free program

39
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,389
managers after right I managed to climb

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,299
in the top 10 of the platform

41
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,360
yes we are invited me to a live acting

42
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,110
event where I was able to meet the team

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,049
and after discussing for bit we decided

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:56,909
to work together and I'm now working as

45
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,719
a technical ambassador for them enough

46
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,030
about myself

47
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,798
let's start talking about self hosting

48
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,310
but first let me tell you why I want to

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,810
talk to you about this subject

50
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,770
the way we built application has

51
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,190
drastically changed in the last year's

52
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,930
what used to be it was a simple

53
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:18,440
architecture with a web server serving

54
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:22,120
static page or maybe some PHP with the

55
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,470
database and some cache server and there

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,720
so when we are looking for

57
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:31,520
vulnerabilities you are looking mostly

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,820
on comm injection or maybe XSS on the

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,620
front web or maybe some injection on SQL

60
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:41,299
or LDAP or any other query language and

61
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,940
maybe some weird interaction between the

62
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,610
cache and the web server everything was

63
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,380
pretty simple and when you found bug

64
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,140
when it was triggering it was pretty

65
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,299
easy to know where and why but the way

66
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,790
that is gross in Graham and our

67
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,140
application looks more like this but you

68
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,630
have a lot balance are talking with

69
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:05,929
loads of micro services some renderings

70
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:09,799
api databases firewalls every kind of

71
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,000
stuff and with an increase of services

72
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,370
you also got an increase of

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,650
communication all of those small nodes

74
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,709
connect with each other usually with

75
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,260
HTTP but not only if you are wondering

76
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,510
why yes srf is becoming the most popular

77
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,880
of high-paying bug this is exactly why

78
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,489
the increased number of communication

79
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,410
also increased the attacks of face with

80
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,209
this increase of attacks face it could

81
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,520
be difficult to know where you bug is

82
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,040
triggering maybe you have something on

83
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,500
the API but maybe it's triggering way in

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,459
the back on the renderer or even on the

85
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,590
database and also as I say in all this

86
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,270
communication in between and the back

87
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,740
can be catch anywhere in this

88
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,270
communication that means even if

89
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,760
something trigger in the back

90
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,830
you don't even know it's triggering so

91
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,070
how do you detect that an expert was

92
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,010
successful usually you use callbacks you

93
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,690
make an exploit that once succeed it

94
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,769
will call back to your server so you can

95
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:08,540
detect the exploitation if you're

96
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,060
looking for survive you have already

97
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,799
probably use bub collaborator that will

98
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,680
show you all the color I've done on an

99
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,600
URL it will generate a unique URL and

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,790
with any query on it

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,729
whichever the protocol is it will show

102
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,520
you what happened so if something

103
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,568
trigger here

104
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,609
I mean a request was done if you are

105
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:32,759
more interested in client side burg you

106
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,490
might be looking for blind exercise and

107
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:39,180
excessive Santa since to be the most

108
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,949
popular one between beg hunters I can

109
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,590
also talk about also kind of fasting

110
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:46,169
like if you need to modify you can use

111
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,128
it a pages or maybe YouTube to upload a

112
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:51,870
Parker you feel exploit maybe in major

113
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:56,340
sometimes I've seen some paste bin with

114
00:04:51,870 --> 00:05:00,030
some poxy in some reports all the storms

115
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,219
are great if you want to quickly start

116
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,559
hunting you just sign up and everything

117
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,259
is working out at the box and it's

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,870
simply walk it's not like on mid script

119
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,870
that's what one time and it's you need

120
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,520
to write again for new exploit

121
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,710
everything what's fine you just register

122
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,780
and let's go and also you got a

123
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,789
community around the stores if you need

124
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,919
some help you can just post on Twitter

125
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,270
or some fur on some forums then you get

126
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,448
out because people are used to these

127
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,909
tools but all those tools come with a

128
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,830
cost and the cost is trust you need to

129
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,930
put trust in all the people involved in

130
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,539
the loop from the developer of the

131
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,330
application to the people managing the

132
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,130
application with the hosting company

133
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,979
do you trust where the logger stored

134
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,930
with the back you bastard and also the

135
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:48,810
law in the country where the service is

136
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,900
Austin another issue with third-party

137
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,210
Services is the centralization all those

138
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,270
bug come to the same place and this is a

139
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,000
juicy target for black hat what if you

140
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,789
can control the server running exist a

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,400
sensor or collaborator you could have

142
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:08,370
access to all the bug first and you can

143
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,400
use them before they can be reported to

144
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:14,099
their companies and why you think these

145
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,229
services are well protected I think

146
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:20,849
having a single point of failure is very

147
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,650
dangerous self hosting could be an abuse

148
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:25,139
solution to this kind of problem if you

149
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,060
have multiple nodes of the same service

150
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,210
there is no single port of failure

151
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,430
anymore so why do I girls do not just

152
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,919
simply self host is it because they do

153
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,770
not care about privacy I don't think so

154
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,620
I girls are very well

155
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,940
about privacy issue if you go to a king

156
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,129
convention you will see people with

157
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,699
chickens and telling other than they

158
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:48,139
don't want their picture to be taken and

159
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,150
I met a lot of people without any

160
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,740
facebook or any social media accounts

161
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,969
because they don't twelve men with their

162
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:59,030
private information so why do you trust

163
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:02,030
someone else with your bugs so this is

164
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,919
not about privacy maybe is it because

165
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,638
it's too difficult maybe it's not

166
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,859
possible to us to services but no like

167
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,620
you can just go on the web and download

168
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,080
X is a sensor and put it in a docker

169
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,560
somewhere or you can just use the bob

170
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,770
collaborator java file and post it on

171
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,460
another server it's doable it's not easy

172
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,740
but it's doable so if I care about

173
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,318
privacy and if it's really possible to

174
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,300
us all of this stuff wildin they're not

175
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,969
doing it is it because they are lazy

176
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,159
now once again I don't think I can sign

177
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:39,440
lazy just look at the grinding some of

178
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:43,490
people are doing to some submit back

179
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,590
every day I guess I'm not lazy so if

180
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,560
it's not any of this white workers not

181
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,989
simply self host first I think it's very

182
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,669
time consuming and you probably think

183
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,800
you're a better thing to do like you

184
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:58,430
don't want to spend days on setting up

185
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,039
web server and your DNS and your SSL

186
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,860
connection because you watch busy

187
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,050
finding bugs so if finding bugs is what

188
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,180
you like to do doing advances is

189
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,349
probably boring for you is not

190
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,690
interesting at all you just want

191
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:13,430
something that works and at all best

192
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,500
thing is it's not a one-time thing once

193
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,870
you set up your server you need to keep

194
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,930
it updated you need to be sure it's

195
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,029
still safe this winter I decided to

196
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,279
change my own server for new one and I

197
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,979
wanted something that was more easy to

198
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,509
manage and to a date and so today I

199
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,460
wanted to share with you with a product

200
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,969
came up crib so this is my new project

201
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,529
the planning machine the goal of the

202
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:39,469
planning machine is to have something

203
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:43,789
that's easy to set up fast to set up and

204
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:47,959
easy to manage for interns so let's take

205
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,520
a look at all this work to start running

206
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,060
the pinning machine you will need elite

207
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,480
oofy

208
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:57,410
one server running docker and a domain

209
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,980
name once installed you get access to a

210
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,719
DNS server and serving five domain name

211
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,120
traffic reverse proxy that will make the

212
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,450
communication between all your sub

213
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,810
services and web it will also be in

214
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,250
charge of managing your SSL certificate

215
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:17,689
and you also get access to a pipeline

216
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,730
runner I will talk about this later the

217
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,770
first thing the pin machine offer is a

218
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,230
web server you always need a web server

219
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,730
because most of the time the service

220
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,070
you're attacking are communicating in

221
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:31,550
HTTP and you want something that talk

222
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,560
HTTP to talk with them the server use

223
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,770
PHP to run some codes because it's the

224
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,859
fastest way to have webpage running

225
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,800
without setting up a lot of stuff the

226
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,140
server answer to any subdomain so you

227
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,020
can do whatever that shoulder mint.com

228
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,850
it will work out work is the subdomain

229
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,319
will be mapped to a folder so if you

230
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,330
want to create a new subdomain you just

231
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,210
create a new folder and the subdomain is

232
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,820
created because I use traffic and power

233
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,770
DNS all the SS and stuff is already

234
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,750
undone for you automatically you don't

235
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:06,110
need to set up a new certificate for

236
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,589
each subdomain also the nginx server

237
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,780
come with two special follows the course

238
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:14,180
folders which will always answer with

239
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,890
valid course letters it's very useful

240
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,089
when you try to do clean bug and you

241
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,870
don't want to set up a new one every

242
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:22,580
time and the public folder is just as

243
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,650
like another subdomain but you get

244
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,820
directory listing so if you want to

245
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,350
share stuff with the world

246
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,670
you can just put it in your public

247
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:34,250
folder with Ingenix also choose to add

248
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,910
three basic server in the core of the

249
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,209
pin machine

250
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:41,959
the first one is request bin it's a very

251
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:44,270
useful request logger you can just

252
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,410
create a request bin under server yeah

253
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,380
you can see I'm on the road because

254
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:54,640
we're not be out at UK it will give me

255
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:54,640
an URL and if I decided to curl the URL

256
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:02,160
I can see the output here it's basically

257
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,500
like web collaborator but it's running

258
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,269
on your own server it also supports the

259
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,589
file upload and stuff like that

260
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:13,230
the next one is request bin

261
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,940
it's an HTTP request debugger it's very

262
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,320
useful when you do outdoing as a ref

263
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,079
request and you want to know what

264
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,000
exactly the kind of request we save if

265
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:23,250
you only look at your engine expert you

266
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,709
will get the method and maybe the get

267
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,490
parameter but that's all so here you can

268
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:31,199
just create a new bin copy Jade rice and

269
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,720
submit it as your exploit yeah we just

270
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,120
use comb to make a demonstration so I

271
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:42,269
can call this to owl let's put some data

272
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:44,790
maybe and we get to ok the request has

273
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:47,399
went through and if you look here we can

274
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,620
refresh and we got the phone requires

275
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,570
with the post parameter this is very

276
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:56,390
useful for HTTP requests it will replace

277
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,390
the bub collaborator for HTTP very easy

278
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:02,250
the next service is a transfer that the

279
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,589
sage instance this is the file sharing

280
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,839
software it's very useful when you have

281
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,470
to share a file for report or just for

282
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,140
exploitation

283
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,510
you can just upload file and download

284
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,579
them but why I choose this one is

285
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,529
because you can use it for very easily

286
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,800
from the comment line for example

287
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:21,930
imagine on a remote server and I can and

288
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,109
I managed to do a call come in I can

289
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:29,630
just do the upload file let's upload my

290
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:32,730
ptc password to my server so HTTP that

291
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:39,300
transfer that b IDK i can choose the

292
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:41,279
file name like EG c place WD demo the

293
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,810
file will be uploaded and it will give

294
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,329
me back an URL and i can just visit to

295
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:53,010
download the file but it's what I like a

296
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:56,640
lot about transfer is you can just W get

297
00:12:53,010 --> 00:13:00,120
the file and it will walk instantly it

298
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,600
will detect your jet so a very good way

299
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,990
to transfer file between servers if you

300
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,800
are you

301
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:10,580
very heavy come online user

302
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,699
and the last tool is kmb it's a markdown

303
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,080
editor I use an online editor instead of

304
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,410
local notes because when I'm doing

305
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,089
collaborative McGuinty it's easier to

306
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,640
have something where everyone can edit

307
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:24,740
at the same time also the amalgams

308
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,770
support is very powerful with korean

309
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,209
beef that means that at the end when you

310
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,370
have finished write all your notes on

311
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,949
your pen test you can just submit the

312
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,350
report directly to the platform any 3:12

313
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,510
work just like that because now they all

314
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,630
the platform I know use markdown other

315
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,730
way to write reports so let's get

316
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:46,250
started and let's see how to use the

317
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,200
pone machine here I've cloned the

318
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,440
panache in repository and I've edited

319
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,899
the config file since the pin machine is

320
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,029
heavily based on Dhaka and dhaka machine

321
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:59,510
you will first need to set up a document

322
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,760
in is very simple and then you specify

323
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:05,630
the dhaka machine in your config file

324
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,890
yeah maitake mushroom is bit k i will

325
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,270
configure the first time i will use

326
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:13,130
because everything will be based on this

327
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,170
also in the environment I setup my

328
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:18,380
server IP but that would be useful for

329
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:22,430
the DNS my Austin once again here I use

330
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:26,600
a reference from mo some configuration

331
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,229
for API buttons yet and the services I

332
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,329
want to run

333
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,880
yeah will run in Jennings power DNS

334
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:36,890
traffic the pad to request bin and

335
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:39,649
transfer and at the end this is the HTTP

336
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:44,540
configuration I want to serve HTTP for

337
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:47,690
also domain on nginx on port 80 and on

338
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,550
request bean and bad and transfer this

339
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,800
is this other subdomain I used before

340
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:56,899
and this is the service they are talking

341
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,699
to at the end so let's get started here

342
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,740
in this folder I've cloned the pin

343
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,990
machine repository and I've installed

344
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:07,130
the p.m. client I've also already

345
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:10,420
configured the key machine to

346
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:14,240
communicate with my oast the idea to K

347
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:17,599
and I've configured the config file

348
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,630
I put the docker machine here the

349
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,570
hostname I want to use and some of them

350
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,830
valuable the service I want to stop this

351
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:30,860
is our these are the core services and

352
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:37,180
the rules for the HTTP so each service

353
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:40,250
is born to a container and a pot and

354
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:43,219
since managing and remembering a lot of

355
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,650
docker command is time-consuming I've

356
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,890
build a simple command-line tool to help

357
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:53,030
you up with it so let's start the

358
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:54,740
filling machine it take around five to

359
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,990
ten minute to install everything yeah I

360
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,420
had to do it on 3G because my internet

361
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:03,610
Brook during the recording so it'd take

362
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,610
a little bit more so sit back and enjoy

363
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,120
just kidding I won't let you watch the

364
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,830
whole process but at the end you end up

365
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,590
with something that gave me like this

366
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:20,320
we've all your services running and you

367
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:24,010
only had to put your domain name and you

368
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,870
will took a machine name now that

369
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:28,270
everything is ready let's take a look at

370
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,220
the put machine command line tool so you

371
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,650
got a simple command line tool with

372
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,100
syntax inspired by Daka but it also

373
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:38,590
provide extra command like for example

374
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,380
one thing you ever need to do is to

375
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,110
change something on your server web

376
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,870
instead of SSH into your server what we

377
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,960
will do here is just use sshfs 2-month

378
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,300
your container volume install your OS

379
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,060
here so keep in mind everything is

380
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,969
running another car on a remote server

381
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:01,209
like an i can just use p.m. means I want

382
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:06,130
to learn by Rev route and it's wait a

383
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:08,650
bit this will mean the volume on your

384
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,839
computer and you can access all the file

385
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:14,050
lock on your home computer that means

386
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,698
you can use all your editors or any

387
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,740
software on your computers to edit the

388
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,439
file but the file will be edited on the

389
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,870
remote website for example I got this

390
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,240
all sealed folders in my web server keep

391
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:27,208
in mind that each folder matches

392
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,350
subdomain if I want to create a new

393
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,530
subdomain I just need to create a folder

394
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:35,740
in these routines I got a redirect

395
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:41,200
script that do a simple resurrection so

396
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:43,830
let's edit it just to put a friendly

397
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,830
message at the end

398
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:55,899
save the file and now we can just check

399
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:57,129
the fine line yeah I'm on this it is not

400
00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:00,840
the idea to case that should rag that

401
00:17:57,129 --> 00:18:05,799
PHP and I out I put cheapest X so

402
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:08,049
here is our text a string but it is

403
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,559
simple as that you just need to muncher

404
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:10,960
a brute

405
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,470
edit your file and save and when you

406
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,049
close the shell automatically the folder

407
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,230
isn't minted now that you know how to

408
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:23,350
modify files on your containers but how

409
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,269
about getting assisted logs put machine

410
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,830
also for you a quick access to the logs

411
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:29,320
for example I want to know what's

412
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,080
happening on my nginx server I can use

413
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,939
juice use the log command the more minus

414
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:39,330
F is just the follow command just like

415
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:42,279
on docker once again I need to a to it

416
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:45,428
yeah I got a live stream of what's

417
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,320
happening on my server let's do a simple

418
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:53,320
request just that everything is working

419
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:56,439
I use HTTP to do this post HTTP slash

420
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:01,960
cut the idea okay let's use a weird

421
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:05,799
domain name like we're slash test and we

422
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:10,779
can see it depend on the logs so just

423
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:13,960
like that you have the log to stop and

424
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:16,419
stop server is as simple for example if

425
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,499
I don't want to use transfer anymore I

426
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:22,929
can just use the M stop transfer I got a

427
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:26,590
auto-completion on the command also that

428
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:29,279
it's faster when you're not on 3G so

429
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,939
let's stop the transfer that Sh

430
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,940
it's down so

431
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:43,780
it's done so let's check if transferred

432
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:45,430
still on transferred at the HK and I got

433
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,020
a four-four because the service is down

434
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,650
and by default it will fall back to

435
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,960
Ingenix

436
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:53,730
since the folder doesn't exist you got

437
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:59,910
at 4-4 so let's start the service again

438
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:01,810
this time with the stop cumin and

439
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:06,010
everything should be back on in matter

440
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:08,500
of seconds okay let's go again

441
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:13,300
and it's become so it's very easy to

442
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:15,130
start or stop any service starting and

443
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,370
stopping services is fine but even

444
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:21,460
system G can do it so let's try to build

445
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:24,280
a new service let's go to the service

446
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:27,010
folder and we make o you can see our oh

447
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,670
you got extra services on my own website

448
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:32,590
but let's make a private bean service I

449
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:36,160
want to be able to use my server as a

450
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:39,550
buzz bin I create the pilot bin folder

451
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:43,420
and I need to create a docker file a

452
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:45,220
docker compose file here I specified

453
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,850
that I want to use I use the same

454
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:51,040
everywhere for compatibility issue and I

455
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:56,290
defined my service I will now name it

456
00:20:51,040 --> 00:21:00,100
private bin as an image I will use the

457
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:03,670
official image and I will connect it to

458
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,639
the network traffic because I want it to

459
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:10,330
be accessible from the net after being

460
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:14,230
went through the proxy everything seemed

461
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:20,980
fine I just go back and edit the main

462
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:23,980
configuration file so we need to add new

463
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:27,220
folder we created with call date try the

464
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:31,030
bin and we want to create a new domain

465
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:34,120
to to expose a private in I will create

466
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:37,950
the past subdomain it will connect to

467
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,449
the Container private them on the poor

468
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,419
hae because this is the default for for

469
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,769
private bin

470
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:50,710
everything's look fine we just need to

471
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:59,080
save and to run first we build the

472
00:21:50,710 --> 00:22:00,429
service so e/m build a private bin it

473
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,289
should be ready fast

474
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,989
there is almost nothing to do because it

475
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:10,809
just removes mage and we can then start

476
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:17,889
the service VM stopped private bin wait

477
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:22,840
for the clone made it should be working

478
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:27,549
right now so let's check this I'd say

479
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:30,330
first that VI that GK and here it is

480
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:33,239
it's running it's running with HTTPS

481
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:40,480
with let's encrypt and you can start

482
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:43,389
using it right now the effect so it's

483
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,859
very easy to to build new services on

484
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:50,199
top of the pin machine in 90% of the

485
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:52,960
cases you will only need to use the PM

486
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,929
command but some of time you want to go

487
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,149
in the document announced and you can

488
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:06,820
just do this by loading the occupation

489
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:08,590
with just PM oh it's slogan and when

490
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,289
it's you are logged you can just use

491
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,408
classic document to see what's it's

492
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:17,129
actually running and list the volumes

493
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:17,129
and everything

494
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,910
[Music]

495
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:29,418
let's go back for a bit of a view

496
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,280
shimmer so we know our traffic hardiness

497
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,580
and all the services work together now

498
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:38,480
and now it's easy it is to pop a new

499
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,309
service inside the containers let's

500
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,160
let's take a look now at the pipeline

501
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:45,740
runner when you do bhagwanti you often

502
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,470
do the same task over another on

503
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:51,110
multiple domains when you do recon for

504
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,480
example you always start with some DNS

505
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:57,500
enumeration and after that you might

506
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,450
want to do some directory listing take

507
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,299
bacterial enumeration or even some

508
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:05,240
screenshot of each variable on web page

509
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:07,910
on a server and it's always the same

510
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,230
thing since I don't want to do the same

511
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,140
thing over and over again

512
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:14,450
I wrote scripts to do this for me and

513
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,130
because this is not the only kind of

514
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,710
pipeline I want to do I wrote something

515
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:22,309
that is quite generic and you can build

516
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:24,679
your own pipeline with it you might ask

517
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:28,389
what is pipeline what I call a pipeline

518
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:30,770
is a succession of small containers

519
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,990
ephemeral containers that will be only

520
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,809
run once they do a simple task and

521
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:39,200
output the rest of this task in a file

522
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:41,629
or somewhere else and a desk a next

523
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,370
container a spot get the output of the

524
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,630
first one do something else with the

525
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:49,790
data and pass it to the next one etc

526
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:53,690
think of it like succession of common on

527
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:55,700
Linux with pipes between them and

528
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,790
because and demonstration is always

529
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:02,270
better than a long explanation let me

530
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,770
build a pipeline with you our goal will

531
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,320
be to make a pipeline that will

532
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:10,730
enumerate subdomain for given us name

533
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:13,850
and fetch all the subdomain that it

534
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:16,280
found so let's edit the config file have

535
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,770
you I created a pipeline so I will put

536
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,980
it in a folder called pipelines I'll

537
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:25,280
call the file demo pipeline of channel

538
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:27,470
in this pipeline we will have three

539
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,690
services the first one will be a mess it

540
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,669
will take as an argument on his name the

541
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,820
next one is W yet and the last one is

542
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:35,090
copy to the two web because I want W get

543
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,919
to

544
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,720
put in a folder and I prefer to have

545
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,050
small services since I will be able to

546
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,580
reuse them and we own them neither ones

547
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:45,320
the world pipeline take as arguments

548
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,169
understand this will be useful for the

549
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:52,909
completion and validation of the command

550
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:55,040
line and now let's create each service

551
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:58,700
definition itself so let's go to the

552
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:04,510
pipeline folders and I did the demo

553
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,510
pipeline first service will be a mess

554
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,190
fetch directly from the official image

555
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:15,340
and as a command we will simply run the

556
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:19,900
basic pace of enumeration so Annam and

557
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,899
there's name fetch from the command line

558
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:26,330
then we put everything in a folder

559
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,000
called data I mean I must look like for

560
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,550
example we want the data to be available

561
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,850
across all containers running in this

562
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:38,840
pipeline so I will want this data as a

563
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:41,959
volume will create a volume called

564
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,350
internal and monitored data

565
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:53,420
don't forget to create your volunteer

566
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:55,340
internal Tomas we create a file with a

567
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,900
Dennison trench line then we need to

568
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,980
process it so let's create a double you

569
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:06,020
get container as an image we will use

570
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:10,070
Alpine and I'll command we will do the

571
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:12,410
following first we will read all the

572
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:23,120
file all the domain name in the file

573
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:28,930
so write with line do W get the line and

574
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:36,709
we will about it in slash that's our /

575
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:41,070
output / line that HTML

576
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:46,470
done and we will do this we've slashed

577
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:47,790
at at that and a mess plug but first we

578
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:53,220
want to be sure the value gates is

579
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:59,700
installed so a PK w get and the wall

580
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:02,790
Kananga like before we want our data to

581
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:08,040
be match to something so let's put the

582
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:13,620
volume let's mint internal to data and

583
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:15,240
this should be ready to go pan on the

584
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,540
end we'll have a simple container that

585
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:24,020
will copy the output folder to the right

586
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:27,418
boot for example let's click copy to AB

587
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:37,710
we use its internal pin once again and

588
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:45,510
the command will be sickly data output

589
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:50,309
to slash web root output and has volumes

590
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:56,390
we will need the internal one mental

591
00:28:50,309 --> 00:29:01,320
slash data and the right do it burnt on

592
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:04,140
slash web root so we need to specify

593
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,299
wise where it is coming from and it's

594
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:13,290
coming from an external external source

595
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:15,990
and the name is web brute I admit his

596
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,850
personal stake here I need to use double

597
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,740
dollar sign because I don't want that

598
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:23,549
are assigned to refer to took a file

599
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,420
viable but to batch file own so this

600
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:27,269
should be

601
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,830
[Music]

602
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:34,720
once everything is ready you can just

603
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:36,370
run p.m. by playing Alice to see a list

604
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,320
of your pipeline if there is that you

605
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,620
have already defined so we see our

606
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,980
pipeline Decimus then SEM and fetch it

607
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:49,799
we'll use a mass service with us name

608
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:53,190
variable pass it to w8 and copy to web

609
00:29:49,799 --> 00:30:00,549
now we start our pipeline with PM

610
00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:06,340
pipeline pipeline start with our name so

611
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:07,929
dennis element fetch it will not stop

612
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:12,939
because we want the last name so I'll

613
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:16,480
put my last name in the air and the

614
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:21,039
pipeline should be ready to go we can

615
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,749
check again with PM pipeline PS to see

616
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,240
what the pipeline to see the running

617
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:27,220
pipelines and where they're currently so

618
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,749
we see the Dennison abyss and fetch is

619
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,879
running and currently is running on us

620
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:33,039
so we need to wait for everything to

621
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:38,168
finish to see the result in our web

622
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:40,299
folder you can also stop multiple PyCon

623
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:44,369
at some time so we have BHK running but

624
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:52,629
you can also have wagon or google.com or

625
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:54,039
there's a one on Facebook and you have

626
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:57,309
all of them running at the same time on

627
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:58,840
different containers you can notice you

628
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:03,059
can still through all of them and where

629
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,059
they are in the running State

630
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,870
there we are all of them stuck in on us

631
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:16,810
our first one is finished so we can now

632
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:30,229
look at the output in the weblog so my

633
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:35,360
web root and in the root we should have

634
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:37,640
our output folders we have all our dot

635
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,260
HTML for all the DNS and iteration we

636
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:45,170
have weird so this is basically the

637
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,780
pipeline this look like a lot like this

638
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:51,980
look a lot like a CI from a gate lab for

639
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:57,920
example but it is more adapt for your

640
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:59,540
everyday well Vinci life so this was the

641
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:06,890
pruning machine with all the services

642
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:08,300
and the pipeline runner because this is

643
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:11,510
a main event I will do the

644
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:14,200
question/answer buff by myself so this

645
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:17,379
is the question I thought you might have

646
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,540
the first one is is it ready almost

647
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:23,150
still got some documentation to do and

648
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:27,020
some testing to be sure you don't have

649
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:28,900
you data arrays with a Miss command or

650
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,340
something like this so I need to

651
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:34,760
foolproof it a little bit more before we

652
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:37,100
sink to the public so if it's not ready

653
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,650
when will it be available and I think

654
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:42,129
I'm will be able to publish first beta

655
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:46,490
version in the next weeks it will be

656
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:48,350
available on the yes we are github you

657
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:52,240
will be able to find the link on my

658
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,240
Twitter on the yes react Twitter no war

659
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,830
the next one is how much will discussed

660
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,770
so the project is open source so it will

661
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:03,949
obviously be free but you need to rent a

662
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,870
server to ostraca machine you can use a

663
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:09,050
virtual machine on your own computer but

664
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:10,909
it will be kind of pointless because you

665
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:13,310
won't be able to validate the ssl and

666
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:16,430
everything so you will probably need to

667
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:19,129
rent a VPS I think around 20 bucks a

668
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:22,370
month should be perfectly okay

669
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:24,559
all of this and because it's so modular

670
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,418
if you want to have something more beefy

671
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,309
throw in more services it's up to you

672
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:32,419
but I think we've twenty bucks a month

673
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:34,960
you can run this easily and twenty bucks

674
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:39,980
a month I think it's a fair price for

675
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,480
someone doing black beauty every day the

676
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,679
next question will be probably what

677
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:48,259
about axiom because axiom is another

678
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,809
kind of self esteem way to run your

679
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:52,129
tools in the cloud but it's a bit

680
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:54,620
different from the pin machine

681
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:56,120
I think axiom is more about when we

682
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,668
don't want to instant tool you don't you

683
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,678
want to have everything available right

684
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:02,690
away so you just start up a container

685
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:04,029
and run the tool in the container weaved

686
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:07,669
upon machine it will be more about

687
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:10,280
having also a place you can call home

688
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:13,250
your own server when you can keep your

689
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,649
blog on it all your tools on it so I

690
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,530
think both of them are complementary and

691
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:20,179
I hope in the future then when you are

692
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,369
using axiom you can use the point

693
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:26,720
machine as a back-end so you can use the

694
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:29,929
power of both tool at the same time and

695
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,399
finally do I need some help yes please

696
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,790
I'm the only one working with the

697
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:36,918
project if you want to take part in it

698
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:39,440
will be just by writing more services by

699
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,029
converting already existing tokens to

700
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,119
the template formats I haven't talked

701
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,740
about it a lot but I will need help with

702
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,240

703
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:48,918

717
