63
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,010
challenges for the binary exploitation

64
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,019
category because he is much smarter than

65
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,060
I am in that regard so he whipped out

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,710

those hard hitters and Trevor Trevor

69
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,230
also helped creating a lot of the

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,060
challenges in the steganography category

71
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,119
as well as some in the oceans or the

72
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,920
open source intelligence category and he

73
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,780

74
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,309
during the game so kudos and thank you

and that is honestly such a crazy

104

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,280
be because I am so grateful with the

111
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,690
challenges that you put together and

112

and helping answering questions etc so

114
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,280
he put together a lot of the good binary

115
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,530
exploitation challenges some

116
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,969
and some scripting so thank you so much

117
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,729
Matt I cannot say thank you enough and

118
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,740
of course there's us what did you put

119
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,660
together kill so I worked on a couple of

120
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,830
the really easy like web challenges and

121
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,410
a few of the warm-up challenges

122
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,840
challenge development is not necessarily

123
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,020
my favorite thing but I do it to help

124
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,880
John most of the time but I really do

125
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,640
enjoy playing CTF so most of what I did

126
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,670
was helping John kind of just set up the

127
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,710
CTF in general and just kind of helping

128
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,940
with the whole process from start to

129
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,969
finish yeah

130
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,430
we are preparing this talk before nam

131
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,100
khan actually kicks off before the CTF

132
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,770
begins so I'm kind of driving blind and

133
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,240
what I'm talking about here but I mean I

134
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,590
put together kind of all the other

135
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,290
challenges that weren't specifically

136
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,419
mentioned the infrastructure was really

137
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,800
just all me and some dirty scripts and

138
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,840
code a little bit of terraform which was

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,490
super duper cool and obviously testing

140
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,609
and trying to help hosts when the real

141
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,070
game time hits but we're just so excited

142
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,440
we really hope that you guys now talking

143
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,880
after the game has ended when we're

144
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,530
speaking about it before it's even

145
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,150
started I just really really hope you

146
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,070
enjoy the game and I'm hopeful that all

147
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,280
the servers kept up hopefully the

148
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,719
infrastructure was in place so this idea

149
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,070
originally started a lot of the

150
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,070
challenges the idea that we could like

151
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,260
make a CTF and put it on kind of became

152
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,750
real with verse icon which was something

153
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,450
that we did in April John was asked by

154
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,580
non sec and the cyber mentor to kind of

155
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,320
put together something last minute when

156
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,300
kovat had kind of started and they were

157
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,820
like let's do something virtual so we

158
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,280
had 67 challenges and we had about 2,500

159
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,770
users by the end of the game I think

160
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,539
scoring wise and throughout it we had a

161
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,690
constant somewhere between 1,500 and

162
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,550
2,000 people playing we ended up using

163
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,800
only seven front end servers and

164
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,080
back-end servers and the way that we set

165
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,180
those up and did that for ver ii was

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,030
very different than what we did for non

167
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,160
con which will kind of get into now so

168
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,989
yeah i wanted to use that set up slide

169
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,200
to kind of lay the foundation because

170
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:36,400
nam khan CTF is even bigger and better

171
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,560
than versailles con this time around

172
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,179
obviously june 13th we're here with nam

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,170
sach we're here with a cyber mentor stok

174
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,120
and myself

175
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,070
this capture-the-flag with everyone's

176
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,450
help that I just mentioned so so

177
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,560
thankful for all the community support

178
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,170
and everyone around me

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,140
we brought 80 challenges to the table

180
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,870
more than versat khan and by the start

181
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,000
of the game we had over 3000 people

182
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,500
register so we knocked verse at Khan

183
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,680
adalah water and I think we're actually

184
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,150
getting close to 3,500 we still got two

185
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,800
hours until the game starts moving on

186
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,929
when I check a real time while we're

187
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,910
prepping this talk but we amped up the

188
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,920
infrastructure we've got 10 front end

189
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,450
servers as time 10 backend servers we

190
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,180
got some load balancers to distribute

191
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,920
them and we did a lot of much smarter

192
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,740
things in preparing for the game and

193
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,540
hopefully hopefully we'll see that just

194
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,410
unfold and hopefully it'll be a great

195
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,150
game but NomCom CTF much much bigger

196
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,040
much much better than Versailles Khan

197
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,400
and that's where we're at so I'm really

198
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,170
thankful and hopeful for that so I know

199
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,239
most of you will probably know what a

200
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,920
capture the flag is proposing that joins

201
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,530
beginners obviously cyber security

202
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,530
competition and to gamify cyber security

203
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:47,270
skills essentially given a problem you

204
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,549
have to hack it get some kind of flag

205
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,250
whether it's text or random numbers and

206
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,440
letters so specifically for nan Kong

207
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,720
which is different from different from

208
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,270
verse con is that we did when we're able

209
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,010
to include some Osen challenges as well

210
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,049
as some mobile challenges in addition to

211
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,610
all the categories we had last time and

212
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,290
we have definitely bumped up the numbers

213
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,110
in some of the categories especially for

214
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,970
binary exploitation and I know for web

215
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,510
we have quite a few more web challenges

216
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,940
for this round so moving into what we

217
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,950
kind of used for each challenge we chose

218
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,330
to use docker it was something that John

219
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,360
and myself are both kind of already

220
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,770
familiar with so docker is something

221
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,680
that you can use to kind of container

222
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,760
eyes either an application or just a

223
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,910
service that's running

224
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,770
it's basically a smaller version of a

225
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,060
virtual machine it kind of allows you to

226
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,030
not go through the whole process of

227
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:39,530
using a kind of bulky sometimes virtual

228
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,390
machine and just kind of something light

229
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,789
and quick and very easy to set up for

230
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,920
something such as CTF service that

231
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,660
you're going to have to connect to so it

232
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,240
allows us to kind of encapsulate

233
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,550
everything that we want in this little

234
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,850
machine that you're connecting to with

235
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,189
some really easy

236
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,079
scripts and some easy setup so it's an

237
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:00,939
example right there is the docker run

238
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:02,498
you are signing the port that the

239
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:03,849
challenge is supposed to run on to

240
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:05,350
another port which is gonna be really

241
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,329
important later on when we talk about

242
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,149
how many challenges we had and how many

243
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:11,979
we had to use to set up how much like we

244
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:16,569
had to use to actually connect to those

245
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:19,179
a quick deviation though when we're

246
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:20,889
talking about using docker with hosting

247
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,179
to capture the flag challenges we've

248
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:23,709
talked about two different kinds of

249
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,410
challenges right we have the static

250
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,239
downloadable files that a player might

251
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,100
just pull down from the website and the

252
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,929
challenge kind of exists in that puzzle

253
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,029
unwrapping unraveling that trying to

254
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:35,949
find a flag but we also have the active

255
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:38,319
services that docker allows us to do

256
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:40,868
when we create an active service though

257
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:44,410
we're kind of trusting the player to

258
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:46,779
behave and work within that so inverse

259
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,009
at con and even in Nam con CTF we put

260
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:50,230
together some challenges where you would

261
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:53,199
interact with a shell like an actual

262
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,639
Linux command line and do specific

263
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:58,269
things within the file system to track

264
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,689
down a flag what we noticed in verse at

265
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:03,970
Con CTF and we've seen before is that

266
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:06,990
it's hard to open this up to the world

267
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,129
and expect everyone to behave right so

268
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,620
sometimes people would vandalize the

269
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:12,550
challenges like yeah I've given you a

270
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,970
Linux file system

271
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,429
hey cool I'm just gonna throw a bunch of

272
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,279
files in here or overflow this thing and

273
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:22,899
go crazy with it and it would just

274
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,929
destroy the challenge that wasn't fun

275
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:27,939
for anyone so what we've come to do and

276
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:30,550
what we've come to realize okay never

277
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:32,379
trust the player let's make all of these

278
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,378
docker containers and these dynamic

279
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:36,999
services as secure as we can be while

280
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:39,670
they still need to be insecure to create

281
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:41,860
a challenge in there so docker can

282
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,779
create things as read-only or create

283
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,049
things with the temp FS or temporary

284
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:49,569
file system and we also learned about NS

285
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:51,639
jail so this is an unofficial Google

286
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:54,009
utility that excuse me an unofficial

287
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,139
Google utility that we kind of found

288
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:57,670
when we spend some time the Google CTF

289
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:59,559
finals over in London but it will

290
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,229
isolate any process that we're kind of

291
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:05,529
creating and put together a jailed file

292
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:07,390
system so it is read-only by default we

293
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,370
can kind of configure that in tweaked

294
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,439
to whatever we'd like but one SuperDuper

295
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,500
cool thing about it is that we can also

296
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,970
customize not just how the environment

297
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,910
looks what the doctor container instance

298
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,640
looks like but we can also customize the

299
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,709
environment / someone connecting to it

300
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,930
not just hey here's a flat image or a

301
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:28,170
static container a docker instance that

302
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:31,300
people can connect to but will allow

303
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,740
actually me a kick off a script as soon

304
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,170
as someone connects so that I can

305
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,149
decorate their environment specific to

306
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,910
that and that's super duper cool

307
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:43,290
so we use that to ensure each of these

308
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,219
services are read-only lockdown secure

309
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,250
still with the ability to have that

310
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,560
capture-the-flag gamification and puzzle

311
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,970
to solve in that so NS jail is really

312
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,420
really cool and we're happy to bring

313
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,640
that in for nom Con CTF so something

314
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,410
that we use to kind of handle the tons

315
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,689
of challenges that we made was docker

316
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,610
compose so docker compose is something

317
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,470
that's not necessarily natively built

318
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,180
into docker but it's a neat tool that we

319
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,130
kind of we found through some research

320
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,750
of how can we automate this how can we

321
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,790
make this as easy as possible we don't

322
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,430
want to manually be doing a lot of this

323
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,130
stuff especially with over 3,000 players

324
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,510
and just a lot of challenges to kind of

325
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,089
check and make sure that they're running

326
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,310
correctly so something that we can do

327
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:26,230
with this is specifically take a

328
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,869
container a challenge container and map

329
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,630
it to the image that we want the docker

330
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,339
image as well as the port so explicit

331
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,649
port mapping so as you can see we have

332
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:37,810
some examples where the web challenges

333
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,699
need to run on port 80 there are web

334
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,609
challenge but we don't we obviously

335
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:44,979
don't have eight different port ATS

336
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,640
that's not a thing so we can map them to

337
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,620
other ports to be able to allow users to

338
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,490
still connect to all the different web

339
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,140
challenges at the same time so we use

340
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,730
John kind of just started at 50,000 and

341
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,970
we just went up from there but we can

342
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:04,570
also using this we're able to stop and

343
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:07,029
start instances like in Mass so we can

344
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,220
say stop this challenge or stop all the

345
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:14,620
challenges and we can also restart them

346
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:16,420
and etc so C T FD is the CTF framework

347
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,699
that we decided to use both for verse

348
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,769
icon and non con so it's basically an

349
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:23,229
open source CTF in a can

350
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:25,199
it's kind of the catchphrase so it

351
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,759
allows us to have user management

352
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:29,170
scoreboards and as well as what John was

353
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,230
talking about dynamic and Static

354
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,628
challenges so C T FD is really nice in

355
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,299
that it's kind of a it's a really easy

356
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:39,939
interface to interact with it is

357
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:42,189
something that's built more towards mass

358
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:43,629
challenge creation not kind of like the

359
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,368
Pico CGI framework that some of you

360
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:48,790
might be familiar with where it's kind

361
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:50,049
of a per individual view and it has its

362
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,259
more geared towards an individual

363
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:57,429
instance per user for C T FD we kind of

364
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:59,139
are doing this in a n mass connection to

365
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:00,850
a challenge connection there are some

366
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,649
other framework options mentioned there

367
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,360
and always you can always create your

368
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,920
own and have a custom one but we chose

369
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,480
to use an open-source ones it was easier

370
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,089
for us C T FD is great and all as a

371
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,519
front-end but it doesn't take care of a

372
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:18,489
lot of the infrastructure for you like P

373
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,100
Co CTF might you will have to kind of go

374
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:22,929
ahead and build deploy create provision

375
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,649
all of the actual hosts and servers that

376
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:29,549
are running the CTF with on your own and

377
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:32,529
there's not a whole lot of good way to

378
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:34,869
there isn't a good way to actually put

379
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:37,629
together a lot of challenges especially

380
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:39,970
if you take a CTF and you reuse things a

381
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:43,660
lot of time you're manually interacting

382
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:47,019
with the admin panel of C T FD and if

383
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,610
you're a programmer or you're a guy that

384
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,379
just kind of likes the keyboard you know

385
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,209
you're normally a keyboard junkie you're

386
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:53,589
trying to automate stuff moving around

387
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:55,209
and clicking around with your mouse it's

388
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:58,149
just really clunky and stupid and wastes

389
00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:00,609
a lot of time so I hated doing that for

390
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:02,350
60 challenges in verse that con 80

391
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,929
challenges in Nam Connor and for any

392
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,879
other games that I put on I just get so

393
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:08,740
tired of doing that what I ended up

394
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,069
doing and putting together was realizing

395
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,369
that well C T FD works with JSON or that

396
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:20,349
what is it JavaScript object notation

397
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:22,809
yeah JSON forgive me write those it'll

398
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,419
export and import some configuration

399
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:27,279
files that are put together with JSON so

400
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:28,929
what I did is that I realize that okay

401
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,999
all of my challenges I can put in a

402
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,519
regular directory structure and then

403
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:34,660
create like the the classic flag texture

404
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,839
or a generate script

405
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:41,199
we build that challenge and specify my

406
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,350
own challenge JSON so I can specify

407
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,949
every single challenge description and

408
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,389
name and what files are attached to it

409
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,878
and point value and everything and hints

410
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:54,339
that might be necessary and I could just

411
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,019
write something that will loop through

412
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:59,110
all of those all the challenges that I

413
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:02,980
have and bundle them up into an import

414
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:05,589
Abul c TF d zip file so that way i don't

415
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,959
need to mess with C T FD whatsoever I

416
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,149
just okay this is start the instance

417
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,319
create it spin it up so that I have a

418
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:13,959
bare-bones

419
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:15,759
empty CTF created and then I just say

420
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,888
let me import this zip that I just

421
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,040
bundled everything for you and then in

422
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:22,449
Mass all of a sudden I have a teach Alan

423
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,040
jizz and I never had to touch the back

424
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:29,290
end that's all put together with Otto C

425
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,839
T FD is kind of a you know my poor man

426
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,310
style of code right that's all my github

427
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,860
if anyone has any interest in that but I

428
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,138
just got so tired of duplicating and

429
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,930
renaming and modifying all the crap

430
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:43,389
within C T FD in the admin panel so Otto

431
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,579
C T FD will allow us to just create one

432
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:47,949
standalone zip file that we can throw at

433
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:49,899
the server and then C T FD will create

434
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:52,000
an instance with all of the challenges

435
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:53,889
ready and available and that's super

436
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,449
duper handy so that's something we put

437
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,130
together for this one and it really made

438
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,569
my life easier putting together all the

439
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:03,970
challenges when it got close to game

440
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:07,030
time digitalocean holy cow

441
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,280
thank you so much digitalocean last time

442
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,740
for versat con thankfully I had some

443
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,480
digitalocean credits from a chap to the

444
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,669
flag that I guess I had won some time

445
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,770
ago that was prized this time around I

446
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,329
didn't have credits and we reached up to

447
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,400
digitalocean and said look guys we're

448
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,678
trying to put together this humongous

449
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,339
worldwide international conference and

450
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,799
capture the flag and we have some help

451
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:32,700
because it's gonna take a little bit of

452
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:35,379
coin to spun up all these servers and

453
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,950
thank you so so much it'll ocean for

454
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:41,289
being willing to help out they have been

455
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,840
phenomenal and giving us now for one

456
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:46,570
thing a new limit on droplets that we

457
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,439
can use a new amount of floating IPS

458
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,539
that I can use

459
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,950
and of course credits actually spent all

460
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:53,049
this up so we can give you the

461
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,330
powerhouse servers that we need to run

462
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,940
this thing so with that we ended up

463
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:01,059
using ten front end servers more than

464
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,850
versat khan and those were those c TF d

465
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,350
instances ten back-end servers for all

466
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,330
the challenges that actually require

467
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,189
docker run docker compose and NS j on

468
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,039
everything we talked about and some load

469
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:15,669
balancers that's okay well actually hide

470
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:17,408
behind all those other ten back end or

471
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:19,299
front-end instances so the load balancer

472
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:21,159
will distribute among them we ended up

473
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,019
using a reduced caching server so we can

474
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,759
keep track of your session c TF d likes

475
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:27,399
that it's also useful when you have a

476
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:28,990
lot of instances and one my sequel

477
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,969
database i need to get a little bit

478
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,620
smarter on this so this is my marching

479
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,169
orders for the next capsule flag or

480
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,330
whatever else i do you can create

481
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:39,580
multiple my sequel databases and make

482
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,158
them replicate each other and maybe

483
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,199
they'll all work off of one main server

484
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,149
that has the real read and write access

485
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,889
but all the others will still map like

486
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:50,258
echo that they'll actually be able to

487
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:51,490
know that information and still pass it

488
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,500
on to all the others and maybe you can

489
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,460
put that behind the load balancer so we

490
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,429
can do that in the future but

491
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,769
digitalocean is what we've been using to

492
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:01,240
host and i'm just so so grateful thank

493
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:03,070
you guys so much for all your support i

494
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,559
definitely would not be able to put this

495
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:10,330
together without your help afford it you

496
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:13,090
know what I mean and terraform terraform

497
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,769
is now what i use to set up all this

498
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,590
infrastructure because digitalocean is

499
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:19,149
great the manual stuff that you deal

500
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,428
with in their web interfaces is really

501
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:23,199
nice and fancy but I still want to

502
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,549
automate all of it because I I'm gonna

503
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,659
need a lot of setup I'm gonna need that

504
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,980
database I'm gonna need that reader

505
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:28,779
server I'm gonna need that front-end I'm

506
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,750
gonna need those backends configured

507
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:33,789
with docker and everything so I got a

508
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,500
little bit smart on terraform this time

509
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:38,019
around and was able to use that to

510
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,690
create all of those instances within

511
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:43,389
digitalocean what I would do is I would

512
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:46,509
create one back-end instance first get

513
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:48,850
it provisioned with docker and docker

514
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:50,169
compose and be able to I don't have an

515
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,668
image and an instance for all the

516
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:53,679
challenges pull down from a repository

517
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:56,019
that I've been working out of and I

518
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,879
would make one front-end instance that

519
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:00,129
would decorate it with nginx and unicorn

520
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:01,270
and have all these workers and spin up

521
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:02,740
the CTF DNS

522
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,530
to connect it to a database because

523
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,060
terraform spun that up as well so once I

524
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,860
had those individual instances of the

525
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,830
front-end or back-end I would just fan

526
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,899
them out and clone them to have more of

527
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,110
them after I've got all the actual

528
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,190
downloadable files and the static stuff

529
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,620
necessary for each of those front ends

530
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:23,710
and all the dynamic services set up for

531
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,050
the backend so I'm pretty pleased with

532
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,910
that terraform code and that stuff if

533
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,050
anyone's interested after the fact I'm

534
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,420
more than happy to share some of that

535
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:34,720
stuff but it's dirty stuff to go ahead

536
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,760
and set up C T FD and docker and

537
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,620
everything but it made my life so much

538
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,560
easier because now we have a quick and

539
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,360
easy orchestration to bring up this

540
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,649
infrastructure whenever we need it so

541
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,240
that's super duper helpful so something

542
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,500
that we have this time that's a little

543
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,050
bit better than the last time we did

544
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,940
have health check scripts for verse

545
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,700
second we kind of made them a little bit

546
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,080
better now instead of just saying like

547
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,880
hey is this challenge up if not just

548
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,800
like restarted for some of those

549
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,050
challenges in verse con that John had

550
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,909
mentioned it didn't really help when

551
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,970
people had already abused the challenge

552
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,440
or checked for that so we kind of got a

553
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,480
little bit smarter this time so this

554
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,060
isn't a screenshot of part of the health

555
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,860
check so it goes through checks it tries

556
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,169
to connect to it says is this healthy if

557
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,820
not it stops it and then restarts it

558
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,340
using that docker compose which is

559
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,320
really important something that for us

560
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,050
to be able to just stop and start those

561
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,939
versus us previously having to manually

562
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,350
go in there and stop and start a

563
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,150
challenge that's what I spend majority

564
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,510
of my time doing the last CTF was

565
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,370
manually going in and finding on every

566
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,010
single logging into every single

567
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,479
back-end and restarting every single

568
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,730
instance of that challenge in the

569
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,280
backend which for some of them was quite

570
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:51,280
often so now it actually allows us to

571
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,649
check that and it will then tell us if

572
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,420
it's back up and running something that

573
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,250
we had talked about I don't think we

574
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,840
implemented it was checking to see if

575
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:04,420
the flag was still where it was supposed

576
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:05,830
to be no not at the moment but we talked

577
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,120
about kind of that's kind of an

578
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,460
improvement as Johnson

579
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,340
marching orders for the next CTF if

580
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,720
possible to have it if we can see that

581
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,669
the flag is still where it's supposed to

582
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,950
be if someone has moved it removed it or

583
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:20,080
that I went through and checked all the

584
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,360
challenges this time hopefully correctly

585
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,000
all the flags were not able to be

586
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,280
removed or edited but you never know so

587
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,300
that's just something to think about for

588
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,010
us for next time so some of the

589
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,169
resources that we had we just kind of

590
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,900
wanted to give you guys a list basic

591
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:40,480
darker stuff daugher is amazing I use

592
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,790
this for I use docker as well as

593
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,670
digitalocean in general for a lot of my

594
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:48,070
personal projects and there are

595
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,680
tutorials and information that's out

596
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,970
there is amazing John mentioned the

597
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,770
terraform stuff he found with

598
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,070
digitalocean

599
00:22:52,770 --> 00:23:00,250
as well as some of the just the other

600
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,360
general stuff that you can have so some

601
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,960
of the other kit hubs we linked to are

602
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,969
NS jail C T FD as well as some of the

603
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,740
Dockers C T FD darker challenges

604
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,690
specifically that we used in order to

605
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,830
like create CTF specific docker

606
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:17,350
containers because you can use docker

607
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:18,820
for anything cool so thank you guys for

608
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,100
tuning in and for just listen to us

609
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,010
listen to us kind of do a spiel on the

610
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,379
CTF and honestly I I just wanted to

611
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:30,190
again drive home to thank you and kudos

612
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:32,440
to you for listening and especially us

613
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,920
thanking all those community supporters

614
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:41,640
our IRL personal friends between Caleb

615
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:44,650
Trevor and Caitlin for one thing and

616
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,180
Combinator and pone function and em Elfa

617

and Adam Langley and everyone that was

618
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,380
willing to help out or so so I'm I can't

619
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,149
say it enough I'm just so thankful for

620
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,010
that if you guys have any other

621
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,960
questions for us hit us up in the

622
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,970
discord I'm happy to hopefully we'll be

623
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,740
doing a stream after the competition

624
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,300
after the CTF n so we can get a little

625
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,680
bit more casual kind of let our hair

626
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,730
down you know and talk about more of the

627
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:09,190
stuff in the weeds and we're again

628
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:11,620
speaking from before the CTF even starts

629
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:14,560
so we are hoping that it all goes well

630
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,360
and it was a great time you're listening

631
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,409
and watching this after the fact after

632
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,240
the competition is over

633
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,590
so fingers crossed everything

634
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,080
off without a hitch and you had a great

635
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,639
time and you learned a lot so thank you

636
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,629
thank you thank you we appreciate all

637
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,630
you all take care

638
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,270
you
