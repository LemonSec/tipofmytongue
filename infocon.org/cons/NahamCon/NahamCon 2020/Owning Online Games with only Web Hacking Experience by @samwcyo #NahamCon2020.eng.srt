1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,130
what's up everybody so now we are back

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,220
and we are moving on to Sam curry aka

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,690
zlz and this is going to be this is the

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,969
talk I'm looking forward to we said at

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,500
the beginning of stream hacking games

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,020
that sounds really cool plus he's a

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,029
Tesla owner and he contributed to verse

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,919
second when we were we were taking

9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,359
donations so I'm just an all-around big

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,949
fan of Sam and I'm actually really

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,320
excited to see what he's got here so

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:30,269
without further ado please welcome Sam

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,769
curry hello and welcome to you owning

14
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,629
online games with only web hacking

15
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,519
experience this talk is pretty much

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,960
aimed towards people with maybe a web

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,300
hacking background who were interested

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,190
in game hacking and it's gonna go over

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,050
you know pretty introductory stuff with

20
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,890
game hacking and then also go over a few

21
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,110
examples of game hacking findings the

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,550
targets today we all had a pretty

23
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,589
explicit permission to test for but

24
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,599
right now there's actually a few bug

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,399
bounty programs that have games as

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,059
assets and examples you know like valve

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,590
and rockstar games so I think it it'll

28
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,989
be a definitely an interesting thing to

29
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,280
explore over the next couple years with

30
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,990
you know maybe getting a solid

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,310
background in game hacking if you're

32
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,179
going to be spending time on these bug

33
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,670
bounty platforms

34
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,830
alright so to get started just a quick

35
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,450
Who am I my name is Sam curry I've been

36
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,390
doing bug bounty for the last three

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,369
years and I also run like a blog for a

38
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,470
lot of like security findings or things

39
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,110
that I found interesting relative to bug

40
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,789
by name application security what's not

41
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,560
mentioned on here is game hacking is

42
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,390
actually how I got into web hacking and

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,460
I think both of them feel very similar

44
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,380
there's an exact same rewards and you

45
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,199
know like rush when you find like a game

46
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,089
hacking bug versus a web hacking bug and

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,820
some of the reasons for this talk I

48
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,479
think game hacking is one of the really

49
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,829
seriously fun things in security video

50
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,060
games are fantastic video games are

51
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,949
super fun and I think there's a huge

52
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,420
number of people who play like Counter

53
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,360
Strike with legends and a bunch of stuff

54
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,509
in the security community and in order

55
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,880
like you know mess around with those

56
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,189
it's just like it's a really a big rush

57
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,140
for a lot of people you have this very

58
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,189
immediate gratification of findings like

59
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,600
let's say you're playing league legends

60
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,459
and you find some bug where you can

61
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,440
become invincible obviously it's like a

62
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,920
lot of fun who wouldn't mess around with

63
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,380
that a little bit and secondly I think

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,359
the barrier of entry for learning game

65
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,400
hacking is really really high or at

66
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,080
least it's a niche there's a lot of

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,020
low-level experience required for game

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,450
hacking and it's not typically seen you

69
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,530
know the the expected skill set that you

70
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,690
would see if you search you known

71
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,920
YouTube how to get in the game hacking

72
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,690
on how to start game hacking it's always

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,929
gonna be like low level stuff and I

74
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,400
think that a talk you know that explores

75
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,080
the similarities between web hacking and

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,600
game hacking would be kind of beneficial

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,820
for people who are interested and of

78
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,650
course lastly lots of people with only

79
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,799
web security background it's not really

80
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,180
common to see people who are actively in

81
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,980
both fields you know you have people who

82
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,750
do low level stuff and web stuff all day

83
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,060
or at least people who are experts in

84
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,410
both so I think that having a strong you

85
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,580
know web and game thing would be an

86
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,530
interesting way to approach this right

87
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,020
now if you were to go out and try our

88
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,520
game hacking there's there's a few

89
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,810
things a few major things that you would

90
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,400
have you know explicit permission to

91
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,620
hack on these bug banding platforms or

92
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,090
if you were just kind of curious where

93
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,980
you could like kept permission and go

94
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,480
report these findings and you know some

95
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,670
of those examples are the big major

96
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,980
platforms like Valve Rockstar Games and

97
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,160
of course like the platforms like

98
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,040
Microsoft and you know with these

99
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,930
consoles and stuff but secondly either's

100
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,120
there's not really a lot you know and

101
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,730
then the vast majority of video games

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,380
that accept security submissions mostly

103
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,250
you're gonna see like you know like

104
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,140
let's say you actually find a

105
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,880
vulnerability in a game or you know you

106
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,260
find some sort of bug you'll have some

107
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,510
sort of form bug submission portal

108
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,250
that's about it and that's pretty much

109
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,959
the only way if you were to like

110
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,170
ethically try to be hacking these

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,209
multiplayer games to have permission and

112
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,260
protection of these platforms that's

113
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,549
just kind of the current standings right

114
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,100
now and to begin really where do you

115
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,620
start if you were to go and like you

116
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,540
know download some game off steam and

117
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,530
you're to start hacking it some of

118
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,900
things you could really start messing

119
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,390
with is just proxying for HP requests

120
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,650
believe it or not there's there's a huge

121
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,200
number of games that are depending on

122
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,000
you know web servers and are sending you

123
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,769
HTP requests back and forth while you're

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,779
playing and it's actually a huge

125
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,060
dependence and you'll you'll start

126
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,710
seeing that there's like so many games

127
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,240
that have these really complicated api

128
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,760
is and things like that and it's not

129
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,920
actually

130
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,750
like you know low level you know tcp/ip

131
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,160
like really raw communication that

132
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,010
you'll have to like intercept and do

133
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,040
like really crazy obstacle course in

134
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,390
order to modify and repeat you know

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,170
second thing really test for its like

136
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,760
HTML and tag injection I I think it

137
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,470
moving forward you know dependence on

138
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,409
browsers and dependence on browser type

139
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,210
interfaces is gonna be really high

140
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,470
already you know League Legends player

141
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,349
names battlegrounds they all have

142
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,640
clients that are mostly in html5 which

143
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,740
is really really interesting or I

144
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,900
shouldn't associate mostly in html5 but

145
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,840
uh portions of it like log and

146
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,640
registration and pages that you can open

147
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,260
in game and things like that that are

148
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,370
really interesting because obviously you

149
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,170
know if there's a browser in a video

150
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,550
game if it's not chromium or something

151
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,590
similar it's gonna be probably some

152
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,670
really hacky browser so you're gonna see

153
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,369
like a lot of you know cross-site

154
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,470
scripting the RCE type bugs and lastly

155
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,410
leaked secrets this is a huge one for

156
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,070
game hacking right now because

157
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,100
dependence on these third party

158
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,810
platforms like valve they're gonna be

159
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,390
passing on these API keys to talk to

160
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,740
talk to one another and compromising one

161
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,900
of those would be pretty major way to do

162
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:40,150
you know have a finding on a video game

163
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,700
lastly you know one of the good things

164
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,109
about video games is like it feels very

165
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,180
similar to a website you know if you if

166
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,470
you were to go to yahoo.com and start

167
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,540
playing around with the functionality

168
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,560
you've got log and registration and like

169
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,590
all these you know particular

170
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,730
functionality zuv search and these these

171
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,530
different he you know logic things to

172
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,600
mess with and for the same is kind of

173
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,260
true with video games where you you go

174
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,390
and you have all these different

175
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,039
functionalities you know you say okay

176
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,539
I've been dropped into plurals

177
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,550
battlegrounds I can shoot my gun and I

178
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,500
can reload it I can walk you know all

179
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,000
these things have potential implications

180
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,010
like with other players and things like

181
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,990
that so I think exploring you know in

182
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,490
game logic is is a very interesting one

183
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,900
and kind of here on the slide I've

184
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,140
listed like a lot of examples of just

185
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,250
thought processes in order to find bugs

186
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,270
you know for instance can I talk ssin

187
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,310
item for a negative amount of money

188
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,870
you've got financial stuff with that you

189
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,550
can just create my money out of nothing

190
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,170
oh and I first one the first one is a

191
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,820
you know what what happened to your

192
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,200
items have you traded two players at

193
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,969
once if you're able to open like a trade

194
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,409
interface with two players is there any

195
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,200
sort of logic that you could abuse nor

196
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,830
do you do for spawn items you know

197
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,300
thirdly

198
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,830
in action I could execute it force a

199
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,970
teleport now this would be really

200
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,310
interesting like let's say there's a

201
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,080
mini game on a game where you can

202
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,730
smuggle some sort of effect that your

203
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,440
character character could take outside

204
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,550
of that mini game just like a lot of

205
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,320
really really interesting logic there

206
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,420
and lastly you know like something like

207
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,530
are there any Indian processes I could

208
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,600
make more efficient or break entirely

209
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,250
this one's really cool something like

210
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,470
safe spotting where you know you're

211
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,870
fighting an NPC for drops and you can

212
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,190
stand in a particular area that the NPC

213
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,320
isn't able to attack you back but you're

214
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,910
able to attack the NPC things like that

215
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,950
are just really really interesting to

216
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,270
explore and have like a really fun time

217
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,090
with these like thought processes where

218
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,979
you're trying to find some sort of area

219
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,429
where you can have a little bit or a lot

220
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,270
of effect that you're not supposed to so

221
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,000
just really interesting things to

222
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,659
explore there and I guess akin to the

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,390
first one one of the games we tested

224
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,420
this was a me donut and X Huey and I'll

225
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,909
link them in the talk but uh we spent a

226
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,700
lot time playing rust uh uh mostly just

227
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,050
for fun but you know when we play this

228
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,490
game we obviously were thinking about

229
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,920
you know ways we could manipulate a

230
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,100
little bit or have fun just messing

231
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,470
around and what we would do is just you

232
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,580
know triad mess with these things

233
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,470
and here's just like a little bit of

234
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,789
background about the game and what's

235
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,460
really missing about that bottom picture

236
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,890
that screenshot there's a bug that's

237
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,510
found in the past where you know and

238
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,979
rust it's like a multiplayer game or

239
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,510
everybody builds bases and stuff

240
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,270
somebody found the bug where you could

241
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,740
type in three zeros and a code lock

242
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,440
where you open someone's door to their

243
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,480
base and if you hit the Clear button and

244
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,340
then lastly the last zero and clear at

245
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,350
the same time you could open any by his

246
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,090
doors so there's this whole chaos in the

247
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,500
game where you know players were going

248
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,719
around reading each other's bases and it

249
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,550
was just crazy but this is just one

250
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,990
example of like a really big finding in

251
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,060
a video game that you know has like a

252
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,780
lot of effect on the whole game

253
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,549
community in the game itself here's just

254
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,520
like example of a something something we

255
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,109
found initially in rust was and that

256
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,579
that's obviously very very very similar

257
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,290
to you know what it is web application

258
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,050
security but Steam does really care

259
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,910
about your username you can have special

260
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,740
characters and whatnot so what we would

261
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,870
do is just throw in like an XSS tag and

262
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,370
join russ servers and you'd see like a

263
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,720
bunch of random things fire you know

264
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,209
there's a lot of third party depend

265
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,069
and some things like these rough sites

266
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:01,258
where you have bands or you have

267
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:04,779
different things like that

268
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:05,829
but uh the way the way it works is you

269
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:07,509
know very similar to blind nexus s

270
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:08,949
what's just one of the first things and

271
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:10,569
here's the second thing is literally

272
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:12,550
like a management console where you have

273
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:14,319
all the player logs the chat logs

274
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,060
everything like that and we're able to

275
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:18,219
fire it in here and simply gain you know

276
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,349
administrative access to the server and

277
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,100
here's like a third one where it's exact

278
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,250
same thing

279
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,660
you've got like metrics for the game

280
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,889
like a Archon console and stuff where

281
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,850
you can do management and basically

282
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,019
there's just tons and tons of these

283
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,110
third-party dependent things where

284
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:36,639
you'll have blinding success and then

285
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,740
lastly is a really really interesting

286
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,079
thing that we're messing with there's

287
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,389
this thing called Tex much Pro that rest

288
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:45,370
uses where it's essentially like HTML

289
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:48,819
and tag stuff and with the way it works

290
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:52,209
is you can throw in you know very simple

291
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:55,029
tags like bold link no parse lion and

292
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:56,949
you can use it in game or in the client

293
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,959
where it'll render text specifically

294
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:00,519
towards that and one of the things we

295
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,800
noticed was there's also this

296
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,839
vulnerability of buffer overflow or

297
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,430
stack overflow worried if you just had

298
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,600
two breaks next to each other and this

299
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,128
was actually found on the forums

300
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,370
somebody just reported this and like a

301
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:14,079
you know commonplace and we were kind of

302
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,759
curious about this because if we're able

303
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,410
to get this you know injected anywhere

304
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,480
in game at another player could see we

305
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,709
could just crash their game so we

306
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,019
started looking around a little bit and

307
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:25,540
we noticed that if we did size equals

308
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,730
one for our player for our username on

309
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,689
Steam whenever we died we wouldn't be

310
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,910
able to see our username where it

311
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:33,129
typically is so it kind of to explore

312
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,660
this further we found that you're able

313
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:36,610
to set this value for a sleeping bag

314
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,469
which you can give to another player and

315
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,939
when you give out value or when you give

316
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,500
that sleeping bag to another player with

317
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:44,889
the modified text whenever they would

318
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,089
die they wouldn't be able to respond as

319
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:49,120
their game and crash because it would

320
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,220
pop up and this was like super super

321
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,379
super interesting because with the

322
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,850
dynamic of rust like individual players

323
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:57,250
are super important typically it'll be

324
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,600
like a clan versus another clan and if

325
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,970
you're able to like let's say you know

326
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,920
like obviously we didn't do this but

327
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,899
like be able to permanently crash the

328
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,399
games like thriller players you could

329
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,470
take over their base and it just changed

330
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,699
the whole dynamic of the game where you

331
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,040
can like pretty much do

332
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:13,719
you want but just like a really

333
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,339
interesting finding that could have had

334
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,669
a lot of you know impact on Russ if

335
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:20,470
somebody had found it but we went and

336
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:23,189
reported this and they patched it pretty

337
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,169
promptly I think it was the next day

338
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:28,358
lastly like again these bugs have been

339
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:29,949
patched but pretty much been used to

340
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:31,569
permanently deny someone access to a

341
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:33,128
server and something somewhere we found

342
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:35,049
was actually my night where he could do

343
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:36,850
similar tag injection but it was a

344
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:38,169
different engine where he could you know

345
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,199
color equals white and do these like

346
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:43,149
kind of fun modifications lastly though

347
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,949
most of the time there's like tag

348
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,720
injection it son exploitable beyond you

349
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:48,849
know like UI bugs where it's just kind

350
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,939
of a nuisance to another player but it's

351
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,220
kind of a fun thing to explore in kunai

352
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:55,988
the second game that I specifically

353
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,109
spent a lot of time on was this game

354
00:11:55,989 --> 00:12:01,029
called black desert online and a lot of

355
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:03,100
the interesting things for this game is

356
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,319
that there's this thing called coherent

357
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,889
UI which is used to you know like

358
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:10,628
display endgame browsers and display you

359
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,419
know the UI and one of the cool things

360
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,679
for Cohen he is kind of solution for

361
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:16,809
it's like hey do you want to display

362
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,509
like an HTML file but you also want to

363
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:21,579
have that HTML file be able to interact

364
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:23,829
with a game it's like let's say you have

365
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:26,079
an interface that pops up where you

366
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:28,029
click like a submit form button you can

367
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,979
actually call with JavaScript the actual

368
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:31,389
application so there's a lot of really

369
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,499
interesting things there you know so if

370
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,720
you have cross-site scripting there's a

371
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:37,629
lot more that you could do and it turns

372
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,819
into a lot of a bigger issue if you

373
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:41,379
notice here this left interface it's

374
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:42,729
actually an in-game interface where you

375
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,919
send they should be requests you get any

376
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,959
cheaper response and then in your game

377
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,899
you can just play this game in the in

378
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,888
the bottom left corner screen and

379
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,749
there's a lot of really similar things

380
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,669
that we started noticing or a started

381
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:56,649
noticing with this game back there

382
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:58,749
coordinate UI here's just an example of

383
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:00,730
their documentation for their JavaScript

384
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:03,299
and the way their JavaScript event

385
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:06,160
handlers work they have a lot of

386
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:10,149
functionality for if you were to create

387
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,259
you know some sort of C++ function you

388
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,359
could actually invoke it with JavaScript

389
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:15,789
so you can create these specific

390
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:20,589
bindings out of the box you can't Leslie

391
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:23,319
call or like do arbitrary C++ but with

392
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:24,149
the way this works if the game did some

393
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:26,740
sort of

394
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,420
C++ handler which was vulnerable or took

395
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,360
in and put then we could call this and

396
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,069
fuzz it a little bit now this one was

397
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,640
really interesting there's actually a

398
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:39,940
down time for black sirs on lion and I

399
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,740
noticed that there was the 504 gateway

400
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,000
timeout and one of the interfaces so

401
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,310
here you can see just like my guild page

402
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,959
and in the bottom right corner there's

403
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,520
just like this error page where it says

404
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,989
you know 504 gateway timeout and that

405
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,640
was actually H peer response that failed

406
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,810
obviously but there's really I'm saying

407
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,880
because it just kind of indicated like

408
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:59,109
there's a lot more web stuff used in

409
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,300
this game and I started yet intercepting

410
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,430
and messing with all these HTTP requests

411
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,620
and there's probably about a hundred of

412
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,989
them and ii started looking around for

413
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:11,020
something interesting and eventually

414
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,709
found this really interesting guild

415
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,880
update request where you can you know

416
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,920
update your guild information with like

417
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,779
an image or like change to buy or

418
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,819
whatever so I started looking for XSS

419
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:23,670
and was really curious you know what the

420
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,220
implications of XSS actually would be

421
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,479
and I went ahead and found this and what

422
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,120
it is just you know standard cross-site

423
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,940
scripting so you know you throw in image

424
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,200
source equals go calm favicon and then

425
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,630
you have that all mode event handler

426
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,709
really do want alert and there's really

427
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,990
cool seeing this alert prompt because

428
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:44,260
it's obviously not a standard you know

429
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:48,880
their prompt you get the nice little

430
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,620
border and notice and stuff and after we

431
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,970
got this or after got XSS

432
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,160
I started fussing around a lot more and

433
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,720
I was able to notice that you could

434
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,689
literally just read the contents of

435
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,970
files via an XML HTTP request to you

436
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,709
know file your I and then a drive and

437
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,990
you could enumerate the files and pull

438
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:06,010
the information this is really cool that

439
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,500
you could actually view the directories

440
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,450
because you know a lot of limitations

441
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,190
here would be like whoa cool you know

442
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,079
you can read arbitrary files but you

443
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,310
don't know the names of the files so if

444
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,250
you wanted to you create like a really

445
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,359
simple scripts where if a victim browsed

446
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,440
your page you could just steal their

447
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,180
files so this is a really cool finding

448
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,300
and obviously like at this point it's

449
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,489
like how do we get RTE right there's you

450
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,079
have a local file read and then it's

451
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,579
really interesting or whatever but like

452
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,989
you feel so close to art so easy so I

453
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:37,359
just started dumping tons and tons of

454
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,550
time in here and one of the things

455
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,990
I was really curious about was what sort

456
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,969
of event handlers do they have and how

457
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,950
could I find these event handlers so I

458
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,839
spent time looking around for these a

459
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,730
lot and I eventually found this page

460
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,950
right here where you've got this like

461
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,420
in-game pop-up and this was typically

462
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,250
shown in game but I just opened in the

463
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,769
browser for simple you know first

464
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:01,480
implication but in the source this page

465
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:03,700
was very sadly this engine call a to

466
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,130
client do Lua so this was like a

467
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,339
arbitrarily defined you know by black

468
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:12,310
desert online C++ MN handler where we

469
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:14,470
could pass an arbitrary Lua right and we

470
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,510
could just call whatever we wanted with

471
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,250
with this to client's u lieu of and

472
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,800
handle here and then what we could pass

473
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,810
in here is just this very very nice OS

474
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,880
that executes you know seemed exe slush

475
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,359
the ping and just execute arbitrary

476
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,370
commands and this was really really cool

477
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,290
because with the way the guild

478
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,240
management works you could essentially

479
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,640
worm this RC against the entire game

480
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,450
against every guild page VA just

481
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,279
executing some Lua functions in order to

482
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:44,649
update the victim's guild page and you

483
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:50,110
could have this nice you know very very

484
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:52,209
terrible uh worm on this game and here's

485
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,860
a quick video demonstration of a nice

486
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,569
little page that I made to demonstrate

487
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,940
this where you know obviously you don't

488
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,160
have to click these but here you've got

489
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,810
running Lua without output running with

490
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,399
in-game output and just you know running

491
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,869
Windows commands and then lastly you've

492
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,720
got that you know director this thing

493
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,489
the second one is actually really cool

494
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,130
the fact that you can run arbitrary lua

495
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,540
because let's say you were able to do

496
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,120
this but you want able to get you know

497
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,040
or let's say if those self RCE

498
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,889
this would be really cool because you

499
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,040
could literally write a bot within the

500
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,870
game you know doing in-game stuff that

501
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,849
wouldn't be detected by a lot of

502
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,189
standard anti cheat methods you know a

503
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,168
lot a lot of stuff would check like okay

504
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,520
is a user you know like modifying

505
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:34,690
anything are they running any

506
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,879
third-party applications which are

507
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:40,270
suspicious but if you're able to RCE

508
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,010
this or XSS this to run Lua script you

509
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,629
could just write a bot you know when I

510
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,799
owned your own HTML saying and run in

511
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,500
game and it wouldn't detect anything

512
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,820
weird happening outside of you know

513
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,310
maybe the options that are actually

514
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,780
executed as Lua lets you invoke

515
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,970
you know like standard in-game stuff

516
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,440
like walking and doing actions and

517
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,970
things like that so I've been like a

518
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,590
really cool thing if you know we didn't

519
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,590
have RC against every other player

520
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,910
another really interesting bonus here is

521
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,920
that when we load that favicon that Eiko

522
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,140
in their fur there's this user number

523
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,520
insert key and the cert key is just like

524
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,410
a secret that user all uses to

525
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,879
authenticate and it's really interesting

526
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,980
is we can just compromise the account

527
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,420
via stealing interfer if we just wanted

528
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,440
to have an arbitrary to find them a

529
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:25,510
Dorothea XSS was patched and now you

530
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,240
know like you have RCE against every

531
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,610
player but it's like is there anything

532
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,020
we could do to get rich in the game you

533
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,790
know this was just kind of like looking

534
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,290
out for fun another finding the mess

535
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,639
with and one of the really cool things

536
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,899
they have a thing called cacao cache

537
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,660
where you know you spend in real life

538
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,580
money and you get and game money which

539
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,960
is debatable and the game community of

540
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,570
whether or not that should be accepted

541
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,110
but in this game it there is definitely

542
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,340
some a little bit of pay to win some

543
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,179
really cool stuff is that this is

544
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,220
processed through something called

545
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,740
payment wall where you know you you buy

546
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,330
something and you get the it goes to

547
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,650
like a third party and there's you know

548
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:03,550
communication between black does online

549
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,720
yourself and payment wall and once it's

550
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,730
confirmed you'll go ahead and get the

551
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,930
in-game stuff so it's not a lot of time

552
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,510
and trying to figure out something cool

553
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,710
to do with payment wall and the flow

554
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,090
basically worked like this the user

555
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,940
would initiate transaction on black this

556
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,429
online it would go to payment wall and

557
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,170
it would be signed by block des online

558
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,720
using a secret key that was not

559
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,370
available to the to the client and once

560
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,080
it's signed all the parameters that was

561
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,310
you know set up on the website it would

562
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,350
redirect you to payment wall in order to

563
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,120
do that so it's real interesting is that

564
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,850
you know if you're able to compromise

565
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,320
that secret key or if you're able to do

566
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,649
some sort of weird hacky thing to add

567
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,990
extra parameters you could arbitrarily

568
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,940
define like an amount or what product

569
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,320
you're buying or change things it's a

570
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,640
lot of really cool room here just play

571
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,169
around with especially that it's like an

572
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,670
automatic transaction what really and I

573
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,980
apologize for all the console on the

574
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:56,770
slide but the way if a solution we found

575
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,320
in or in order to hack this was if we

576
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:02,080
change the normal get request to a put

577
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,090
request for purchasing it that had you

578
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,080
know if we go back a little bit had all

579
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,199
these parameters

580
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,090
and we we duplicated all the parameters

581
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,680
and the put body as well as the get body

582
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:17,260
what it would do is it would process the

583
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:20,610
requests as a per quest but with the

584
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:22,840
wavy application worked it would check

585
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,469
you know it would do some sort of

586
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,090
equivalent of pH P's global parameters

587
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,010
where it doesn't care if it's get put

588
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,830
post or whatever it just sees a

589
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:35,170
parameter exists and it did this for

590
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,280
authenticate or for verifying that the

591
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,950
string and all the parameters were

592
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,700
correct but secondarily it only checked

593
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,930
the get parameters in order to you know

594
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,850
determine the actual logic to

595
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:49,030
application so by sending the put

596
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:52,330
request with V you know correct

597
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,649
parameters in the body and the and the

598
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,840
body of the put request we could

599
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,100
actually arbitrarily modify the get

600
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,470
parameters to whatever we wanted to

601
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,330
because it would say okay okay what's

602
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,370
the body of the protic West okay okay

603
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,860
you know this all makes sense it's all

604
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,139
cryptographically signed and it's good

605
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,570
to go and then for the actual logic of

606
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,180
the payment wall what it would do it was

607
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,790
it would check the get parameters and it

608
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,990
say okay okay the amount is you know

609
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,879
this price and we'll go ahead and move

610
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,110
forward and you could just you know

611
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,600
define this to whatever you want and

612
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,219
that basically ends up with lots and

613
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,600
lots of endgame items for completely

614
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,880
free and something kind of you know

615
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,020
weird that happened here was uh when I

616
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,690
did this I I was you know maybe did a

617
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,450
little too much for items and I had a

618
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,650
support person reach out to me and say

619
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,880
you know we're noticing some weird stuff

620
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,260
for your account there was over two

621
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,320
million dollars in purchases and I guess

622
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,510
that's not really normal for the game so

623
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,860
they wanted to speak to me about it to

624
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:56,430
make sure that everything was going okay

625
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:59,169
but yeah just the summary for that

626
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,960
there's there's a lot of reliance on

627
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,020
like web stuff for video games and like

628
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,090
there's a lot of similar logic behind

629
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,830
video games and web hacking so you know

630
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,840
I think one of the biggest things I see

631
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,419
for the game hacking stuff is people say

632
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,860
well I want to start hacking games where

633
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm curious about hacking games but I

634
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,070
only have you know this limited amount

635
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,879
of experience or this specific you know

636
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,379
skillset

637
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,690
and they're kind of turned off by the

638
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,280
idea of learning this whole new thing so

639
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,320
I'll spend time you know trying to

640
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,870
figure out you know something that is

641
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,760
pretty complicated like low-level stuff

642
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,919
and they won't really have a fun time

643
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,030
learning game hacking so I think it you

644
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,350
know pairing with you together of you

645
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,210
know game hacking web hacking is

646
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,100
probably a really great thing to do for

647
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:42,280
most people who'd be interested in game

648
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,260
hacking and I think that in order to

649
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,490
approach it this way people with web

650
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,320
hacking experiences would probably have

651
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,280
a lot easier time trying to figure this

652
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,169
stuff out and lastly I think that with

653
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,780
the way everything's moving I think

654
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,450
games are probably on the fast track to

655
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,550
have bug bounty programs and I think

656
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,830
that right now there's there's kind of a

657
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,419
nice community or larger community

658
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,179
that's outside of bug banning of people

659
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:10,750
who have game hacking experience but not

660
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:12,190
necessarily you know bug bounding

661
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,740
experience I think and I think in order

662
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,230
to kind of fill that demand that'll be

663
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,580
coming in the next few years it'd be

664
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,350
cool if you know more people got into

665
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,610
game hacking stuff and we're actually

666
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,679
seeing a lot of movement towards that

667
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,080
there's actually a launch of a platform

668
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,310
called cyrex which is a game bug betting

669
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,070
platform that'll be interesting to see

670
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:34,360
where it goes and I think that you know

671
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,850
not number on one slide but I think it's

672
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,050
probably the funnest runs the security

673
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,500
especially for people who love video

674
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:43,690
games be if you have any questions feel

675
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,320
free to reach out on Twitter it's at Sam

676
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,610
wcy o or si MW CYO just show me the

677
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,800
Ameri thing if there's anything you're

678
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,750
curious about or interested in or that I

679
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,270
needed to or didn't do a good job of

680
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,230
explaining but thanks so much and if you

681
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,680
guys have a good rest of the conference

682
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,680
Cheers

683
