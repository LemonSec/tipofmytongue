1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,520
all right

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,600
to start with thank you very much ben

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,040
and crew for having me

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,400
i'm very appreciative and i love what

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,639
naham khan has become it's a very

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,080
exciting conference

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,679
and it's such a

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,120
an honor to be amongst the lineup that

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,880
you selected this year thank you again

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,560
um

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
this talk is going to expand a bit

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,080
firstly

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,439
hi for those of you that don't know me

14
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,080
i'm michael i commonly go by kadingo and

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,480
i make educational content on youtube

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,080
mostly around the bug banning space with

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,399
an emphasis on tooling

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,840
and in my day job i'm the senior

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,520
director of security operations for bug

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
crowd i run the triage team

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,840
a couple of other teams there that we'll

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
talk about in the future that are around

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,800
the standardization of bug bounties but

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,760
the

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,000
part i want to talk to you about today

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,719
is an expansion on a previous talk i did

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,000
on recon fundamentals and in that talk

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,399
i introduced two concepts

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,879
the cataloging of tools you know are

30
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,039
they doing wide level recon

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,199
or narrow level recon

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,519
and are they active or are they passive

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
and i think it's important to use these

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,439
terms more frequently to not just talk

35
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,439
about everything as recon because a

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,920
recon tool can have a variety of intents

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
it can be something that touches an

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,080
asset you need to be aware of that or it

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
can be something that doesn't and it's

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,119
just using our synth sources and it's

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,560
great to be understanding of that as

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
well so

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,680
we'll kick off with some examples of

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
that to further elaborate on that

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,439
concept and touch on that concept more

46
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,040
and then from there

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,640
i'd like to show off some of the recent

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
tooling that i think is

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
pretty exciting in this space so kaido

50
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,720
truffle hog

51
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,759
and

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,840
already released but also

53
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,159
still reasonably recent security trails

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,799
sql explorer engine and how

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,479
those are exciting me

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,680
how they kind of relate back to this

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,600
concept and why i think you need to have

58
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
them on your roadmap for the future so

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,799
without further ado thank you again for

60
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,119
having me and let's cut into it i just

61
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,640
recorded this and i forgot to hit start

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
recording there's no bigger frustration

63
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,479
as a creator um

64
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,040
let's do round two basically i wanted to

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,119
quickly retouch on what my previous talk

66
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,120
covered um you can find this in both

67
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,360
written and for written and video format

68
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520
to consume after this if you'd like

69
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,959
the two things that i introduced were

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,640
narrow and wide

71
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
wide level recon is when you're doing

72
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
what's commonly coined up today is

73
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,120
attack surface mapping you're

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
understanding what are the pieces that

75
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,760
make up this organization uh what are

76
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
they what's their domain space look like

77
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,280
and things like that

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,120
narrow is when you start digging into an

79
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
asset so you might pick a web

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,640
application start doing directory brute

81
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,080
forcing and things like that you're

82
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,920
still doing recon and you're still

83
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,160
mapping out the application but you're

84
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,599
now in the recon phase where you're

85
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,319
narrowly honing in on a target

86
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,000
further from that we've got active

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,239
testing and passive testing passive

88
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,319
testing is when you're using an

89
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,080
intermediary or doing something that's

90
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
not going to actually send a request to

91
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,840
your target you're using

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
github to look for credentials or api

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
keys using a tool like truffle hog it's

94
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
going up and doing that for you all

95
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,920
manually you're using often sources like

96
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,480
security trials waxy and other things to

97
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,840
capture data that they've already

98
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,040
captured when they've done active

99
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,080
testing

100
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,599
then you're not as concerned with the

101
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,200
program's brief on rate limiting then

102
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
because you're not actually touching the

103
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
program you're using intermediaries and

104
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,599
third parties

105
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,519
however once you move into the active

106
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,720
phase that's when you're sending

107
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,319
requests to the target so you're going

108
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,720
through cardo or dirt suite or zap proxy

109
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
you're sending requests or maybe you're

110
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
using f5 in your directory brute forcing

111
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,280
all of these things are actively on the

112
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
target and that's the defining

113
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
difference is when you're looking at a

114
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,319
tool is this something where i need to

115
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,920
go to the brief i need to understand

116
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,519
whether what i'm testing or i need to

117
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,760
consider as a red team operator you know

118
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920
what are the impacts on the application

119
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,120
am i going to fire off some alerts i

120
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
don't want to fire um

121
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,120
or is this a more passive tool so we'll

122
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,480
break down some tools we'll put them

123
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,400
into some categories understanding that

124
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,159
this isn't binary a tool can be both

125
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
active and passive um we'll cover that

126
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,959
in the next block

127
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,040
all right so let's talk about some tools

128
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,120
and whether they're active passive

129
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
narrow or wide

130
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
mostly because it's very easy once you

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,120
start to use these terms to start to put

132
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
things into a single box and not realize

133
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
that they're descriptors for their

134
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,680
behavior but tools can have multiple

135
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,079
behaviors associated with them so let's

136
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,479
take subfinder and a mass for example

137
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,440
they're both active and passive tools

138
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,880
they can passively crawl external aussie

139
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
data sources for you

140
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,479
collect a range of information but they

141
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,720
also have active modes in them that will

142
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,040
touch a target touch logs and things

143
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
like that in terms of the defining

144
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
difference between the two subfinder and

145
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
carrying a bias here because i was in

146
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
this team in the beginning but subfinder

147
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,280
was developed with the entirety of

148
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
intent to be passive from the beginning

149
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
the entire design flow

150
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
the pattern of the program is to be

151
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,520
passive unless you force active modes to

152
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,639
happen where a mass added

153
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
passive as a defining feature into the

154
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
application much later in the

155
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
development process

156
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
how well that's done i can't fairly say

157
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,440
without spending a lot of time looking

158
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,360
but i can say i'm confident that when i

159
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
use subfinder and i'm using it passively

160
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
that it is doing just that

161
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,400
um

162
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,160
and that's not to say one is better than

163
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,759
the other these days the distinction is

164
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,360
very narrow and it's very much down to

165
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
personal preference so i'm not casting

166
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
advice here i do believe that you should

167
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,479
be very familiar with both in the

168
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,479
current day

169
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
other tools that are a bit more active

170
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,639
and a bit more narrow in testing tend to

171
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,400
be when you're using a proxy such as

172
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,120
kaido or burp suite or zap proxy when

173
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,039
you're using those tools you're

174
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,680
typically narrowing on an in on a target

175
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
and you're doing active testing you're

176
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,240
testing for sql injection using you know

177
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,000
manual techniques or your brute force

178
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
testing you're doing things on a target

179
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
that are going to create log entries and

180
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,680
you're narrowly looking at a target

181
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,080
typically speaking you're not looking at

182
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,880
a range of targets from a wide stance

183
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
but then some other tools that do

184
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,039
similar behaviors such as f5 sit a bit

185
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,199
more in the middle a lot of people would

186
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,240
use f for narrow level testing so brute

187
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
forcing but you can use it for wide

188
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
active testing so you can pass it a

189
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
range of domains

190
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
do wide level testing with brute forcing

191
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
so you could take a directory and test

192
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
that directory over a thousand assets

193
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
that's wide testing

194
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,400
actively because it's creating logs and

195
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
you'll see there's this common theme and

196
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,880
behavior coming out typically speaking

197
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,319
active testing is something that's going

198
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,080
to create a log entry you're touching a

199
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
company's asset directly you're not

200
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,000
looking at github you're not just

201
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,080
looking at external loss in data sources

202
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,600
for sources you're doing something that

203
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,360
touches a web server

204
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,199
and the difference between narrow and

205
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
wide wide you're looking at a collection

206
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,280
you're looking at the range of the

207
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,479
organization

208
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,840
and you're identifying then where you

209
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,759
want to go narrow which is when you're

210
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,520
picking a target and you're really

211
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,639
diving into it so tools can do both and

212
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,479
it's important not to simply catalog

213
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,840
something but it is important to

214
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
understand the intent of what a tool is

215
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
doing so when you

216
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
get to engagements where you don't want

217
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,280
to create a lot of noise which can

218
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,599
happen in your career or if you want to

219
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,039
limit the number of requests you're

220
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,520
sending things like that you understand

221
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,800
is this

222
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
limiting to an awesome data source and

223
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
it's going outside of the defined scope

224
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,880
to collect me assets or is this

225
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,240
something i need to limit because it's

226
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
going directly to the target itself it's

227
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,319
one of the reasons it's important to

228
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,400
start thinking about this and how it

229
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,599
applies to the products that you're

230
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,120
using

231
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,000
all right so

232
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,759
i'm really rusty in front of this camera

233
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,199
it's so much easier

234
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,680
um when you're doing it regularly let's

235
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
try this again

236
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,680
i'd like to cover not just how to

237
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
catalog tools and techniques i think

238
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
that's a useful thing and part of why

239
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,280
i've front loaded this talk with hey

240
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,560
let's understand how to think about

241
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,720
what's touching an asset and what's not

242
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,400
we should also cover some of the

243
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,120
exciting new tooling that's coming up in

244
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,199
both an active and a passive lens and

245
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,080
how

246
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,879
that relates to current testing thinking

247
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
and why i'm kind of excited by it uh

248
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
truffle sex new truffle hog um

249
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,680
is amazing it's a gem it's got so many

250
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,919
checks and it has thought through the

251
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,840
active side of its checks

252
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
in a very safe manner so it does active

253
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,720
testing uh with what it finds passively

254
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
on github but it very safely verifies

255
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,879
that it won't cause risk to a customer

256
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,960
so you can think about that as a both

257
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
passive and active tool but safe to use

258
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,919
on environments

259
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,039
um

260
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,400
with consideration if you're on a red

261
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,559
team engagement you may not want to

262
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,839
have it checking things directly which

263
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
you can do in the tool

264
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,599
the next one that's really exciting me

265
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,640
is kaido it presents a whole new way of

266
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,559
thinking about proxy innovation that

267
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
we've sorely needed in this space for a

268
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
long time

269
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,839
allowing you to do your active testing

270
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,920
in a way that can easily be tracked if

271
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,720
you're a bug bounty hunter a pen tester

272
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,399
even you know doing some sort of blue

273
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,519
team and you're breaking things down

274
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
with the proxy you can run it now in a

275
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,080
remote red box you can log everything

276
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,160
there i can start my testing on this

277
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,120
machine

278
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,000
and i can go in through an ssh session

279
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,680
pick it up on my laptop go sit on the

280
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,440
deck and keep testing i've done that and

281
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,040
i love that flow so i really want to

282
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,920
cover why kaido excites me and lastly

283
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
with the one that we'll start with now

284
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,080
is security trials and the reason

285
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,920
security trials excites me is it's been

286
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
really well integrated now into

287
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,200
subfinder into a mass and hackling's

288
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
done a really good job with the tool

289
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
called hack trials

290
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
but i still believe this distinct

291
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
advantage that you get when you use it

292
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,240
directly and i'd like to provide you an

293
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
example of how i do that when i'm poking

294
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,680
at a target

295
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
to really give me deep insights into

296
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
something and it's almost like

297
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
manually testing the passive perimeter

298
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,560
in a way that allows me to get my

299
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,160
creative juices going and really hit

300
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
flow state on

301
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,200
recon

302
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
in a way that no other tools really done

303
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,160
for me on the command line when i'm

304
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
doing a recon phase from an external

305
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,680
perimeter so wide recon

306
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,839
um but in a way that you can be really

307
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,120
creative with it so i'd like to start

308
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
there and hopefully get others as

309
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,959
excited about it as i am

310
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,640
all right

311
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
this is a hard one to really talk about

312
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,680
because

313
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,360
i think it really comes down to the

314
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,480
creativity you want to bring to play

315
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
tooling consumes security trials data

316
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,519
really well and luke uh hack luke that

317
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,120
is has done a really good job in hack

318
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
trials of making that useful on the

319
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,480
command line

320
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
why i feel this is a useful accoutrement

321
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,519
to that i still use hack trails i use a

322
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,680
lot of licks tools i find them very good

323
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,240
um tom nom nom hackley they're very good

324
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,680
authors to just go and look at all the

325
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,720
things they're building lots of

326
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,079
utilities there

327
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,360
um

328
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,519
why i think this is good is because if

329
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,760
you're hunting and you're in a wide

330
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,880
recon phase the ability to get creative

331
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,519
and to start to think about your target

332
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,360
is often the defining difference between

333
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,519
feeling inspired to hack and feeling a

334
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,880
bit

335
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
not numb to the process but you don't

336
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,040
hit flow state as easily becomes more

337
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
routine and i find

338
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,079
using a tool like this lets me be

339
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,120
creative

340
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
so let's use an example

341
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,079
that i came across recently

342
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,079
bigcommerce.net

343
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,120
we're doing not everything completely

344
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
passive there's no findings here this is

345
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,200
all completely legal and fine

346
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,240
um

347
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,120
if i pop this into security trails as a

348
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
generic return

349
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,399
you can see look there's some reverse

350
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,720
dns here that's giving me domains

351
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
there's some sub domains but for the

352
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,160
most part the domains themselves

353
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,640
have email level protection

354
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,240
um

355
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,120
if we go into it on whois and i can

356
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,320
always do this on the command line too

357
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
usually i'll pair up the command line

358
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
with it so you can see look there's

359
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,279
email level protection

360
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
um and the organization is showing is

361
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,800
not available

362
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
as i explored i ended up thinking okay

363
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,560
well what happens if in the past there's

364
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,959
been other fields where it's been

365
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,959
exposed before it was

366
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,639
uh protected or anything like that and

367
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,959
what i stumbled across was that there

368
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,600
were a series of domains where there was

369
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,519
email level protection but the

370
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,279
organization for the provider they were

371
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,600
using for whois protection was still out

372
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,880
in the clear as

373
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
big commerce so by playing around in the

374
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
sql engine which you see here and this

375
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,440
is the part that i really feel that

376
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,079
creativity comes to play

377
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,079
you know you can see here i can look at

378
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,160
information about ssl certificates

379
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,680
current and historical the apex domains

380
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,320
the sub domains redirects that might be

381
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,560
in place name servers there's a whole

382
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
host of things relating to the apex

383
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,399
domain that i can start to tease out and

384
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,360
explore by doing that here i found a way

385
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
to retrieve a whole host of domains that

386
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,720
otherwise

387
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,959
wouldn't have come into

388
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,399
play so you can see you know it said it

389
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,399
had 33 domains

390
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,000
and i'm not sure if it tells me here the

391
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
results there's 90 results there

392
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,279
and i extended that work further i took

393
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,120
some of these domains i looked at other

394
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
elements of it so you can see there's

395
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,360
somewhere in here bigcommerce.com versus

396
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,839
bigcommerce.net so i started to explore

397
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,680
the extensions of bigcommerce.com and

398
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,839
things like that ultimately giving me a

399
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,959
pretty large result set that extended

400
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,600
well upon what a mass

401
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,959
subfinder and others were able to

402
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,360
provide me with and there's a reason for

403
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,680
that it's not that authors have made a

404
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,839
mistake nobody's actually

405
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,519
made a mistake they've really worked on

406
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,440
these tools hard to make them as

407
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
extensive as possible

408
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,440
whenever you write anything that has to

409
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,600
apply over a large range of assets you

410
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,079
can't possibly cater for every single

411
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,720
edge case and in doing so something

412
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
that's a little bit more niche that you

413
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
can find by doing manual exploration of

414
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,399
a database like this

415
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,240
isn't necessarily going to be catered

416
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,639
for in the tooling because it might in

417
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,360
you know 100 times be useful information

418
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,000
and 99 times out of 100 be junk and not

419
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
return anything so project discovery

420
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,880
with subfinder are going to focus on the

421
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,920
accuracy over you know what could be 99

422
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,880
noise

423
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,519
so it's for me at least been a really

424
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,639
valuable tool to start to dig into

425
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,120
um queries that i've crafted i've got a

426
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,880
number of things that i've come up with

427
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,600
that i use regularly to start on targets

428
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,760
um and then i'll you can download those

429
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,279
results i'll merge them and i'll start

430
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,760
putting them in my notes and i'll verify

431
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
whether there is an attribution there or

432
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
if i'm on a bit of a false herring

433
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
because there is that too you know some

434
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,399
of these could be junk

435
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,680
um

436
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,440
but equally you know the acquisition

437
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,399
information in there tends to be a bit

438
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,160
of an extension on crunch base i don't

439
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
know exactly how they've done it but

440
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,079
i'll usually put crunch base on this

441
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,519
together and i'll get more acquisition

442
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,560
information

443
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
take that to the sql engine and really

444
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
explore and expand on it further

445
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
i believe

446
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,480
patrick

447
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,240
has done a really good job of covering

448
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,079
this i'll try and find the video in post

449
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,160
in in the moment i can't recall if he's

450
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
ever published it but i i do believe

451
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,600
he's done a talk at prior na hong kong

452
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,360
potentially about security trials

453
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,560
specifically

454
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,720
um and i'm sure there's other works out

455
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
there that you could find but i really

456
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
wanted to touch on this is reasonably

457
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,720
new it's only the last year and the last

458
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,399
six months when the sequel engines come

459
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,440
in that it's shown its true strength and

460
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
security trials have really stepped up

461
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,920
um they are now quiet i'd like to see

462
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,760
where that goes and hope that that means

463
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
more powerful things but largely they

464
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,680
also engage heavily with the community

465
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
in their slack running events to build

466
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
out their data set bounty style

467
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,240
competitions for that um and they've

468
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,399
been very receptive to feedback around

469
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,600
this engine

470
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
um either for future improvements or

471
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,519
potential deficiencies things like that

472
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,320
there

473
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
any anyone that talks to community tends

474
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,839
to thrive in this space because the

475
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,360
community is very willing to bring

476
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,079
forward good ideas openly and they make

477
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,360
the most of that

478
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,839
so i'd encourage you take a shot at

479
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,199
playing around with security trials not

480
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,079
just in your tools but if you can't

481
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,759
afford it there is a cost associated

482
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,000
with that if you can afford it take a

483
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,600
poke around the sql engine this isn't

484
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
sponsored content for disclosure they

485
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,360
have given me codes to give away in my

486
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,759
videos before which i've been doing um

487
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,120
but this isn't

488
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,720
in any way a paid endorsement or

489
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
anything like that i just love the

490
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
product it's made me money in my

491
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,279
bounties and

492
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,480
i hope that's coming through in the

493
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,880
passion that i've got for it because

494
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,519
good work deserves good praise so next

495
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,199
let's talk about kaido

496
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,360
now it's still in beta and it's still a

497
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,800
private beta they're adding people

498
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,399
progressively and i really thank the

499
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,000
team for giving myself and others a

500
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,040
chance to start to use it and providing

501
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,800
input um

502
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,279
they're really really rapid to implement

503
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,279
and implement things and it feels like

504
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,519
the communities come back to the proxy

505
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,000
they talk with us they do releases and

506
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
they're really trying to make the

507
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,519
product that people want to use it's not

508
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,839
written in java it's lightweight and

509
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,040
it's portable

510
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
and the fantastic thing about that is as

511
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,360
a tester you really want your tools to

512
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
get out of the way throw them up on a

513
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,079
vps and it avoids you having to

514
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,600
deal with things like akamai bands on

515
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
the home network and getting everyone

516
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
booted from hebrew sites and things like

517
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,439
that and now i completely accept that

518
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,439
with burp sweet and zap that's solvable

519
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,000
with burp suite you can run a sox proxy

520
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,079
to a vps and turning your traffic out

521
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,959
that way

522
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,559
that doesn't solve the fact that i need

523
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,280
to sit on you know 64 gig of ram and a

524
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,039
really heavy instance i just want

525
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,640
something lightweight on the fly i want

526
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
my proxy to get out of the way and let

527
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,880
me focus on the core of what i'm doing

528
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,280
and kaido's come to the table with that

529
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,679
you run a binary you use your web

530
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
browser and you interact with the proxy

531
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
and why that's so cool

532
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,760
is they're supporting all manner of

533
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,320
systems and i can put that binary on my

534
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,080
vps and ssh tunnel back the web port and

535
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,120
use my proxy locally whilst exiting my

536
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,360
traffic out of the vps

537
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,280
so i can do some really exciting testing

538
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,240
that way

539
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,720
without having it locally even though

540
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,480
i'm interacting with it locally so i can

541
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,240
do things like uh test on my desktop

542
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,880
using the vps and then resume it later

543
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,280
and now that's great for my workflow

544
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
that suits me really well it's made it's

545
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,039
made everything quite portable i can put

546
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
my vps in location close to my target

547
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,440
i'm in australia so putting something a

548
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,360
vps in san francisco tends to get me

549
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,760
better returns to a target um or if i'm

550
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,200
testing something that's got localized

551
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,960
conditions like hey this is only

552
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,799
available with people in india i can

553
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,799
throw a vps there and i can i can do it

554
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,720
that way um admittedly i haven't dealt

555
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
with that use case yet i've not been

556
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,960
tested very long but that would satisfy

557
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
that condition versus using a vpn or

558
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
something like that

559
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,039
um shout out to protonmailvpn if you

560
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,400
ever need a lot of regions quickly

561
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,080
that's a really good way to get a ton of

562
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
regions very fast

563
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,440
um

564
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,679
back to where i was at so the reason i

565
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,280
find this quite

566
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,679
an exciting approach is for pen testing

567
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,720
firms

568
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
you can also now have your proxy

569
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,799
directly on the red box so in my time

570
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,160
with pen testing

571
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,919
the red box has always been the exit

572
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,600
point and you'd use burp suite with a

573
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,039
socks proxy there

574
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,720
and then at the end of the engagement

575
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
you would take your proxy logs and you

576
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
would upload it and that would be how

577
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,559
you'd retain engagement history for the

578
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,720
long term and that's important because

579
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
you know three six months from now a

580
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,000
client could come back they could have

581
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
an incident and the company needs to be

582
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,320
able to check the pen test companies got

583
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,240
to check what happened and why it

584
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,440
happened

585
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,160
the real benefit behind kaido is now

586
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
everything can be contained to your red

587
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,480
box for the engagement it stores project

588
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
files and you can have your project

589
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,760
files retained there in a means that it

590
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
doesn't touch the testers

591
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,679
local instance

592
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,600
everything's sitting in your remote red

593
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,520
box and everything's contained which

594
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,280
also solves the core problem that you

595
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
would have in pen testing if

596
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
everybody forgets to upload their burp

597
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,320
suite files and there's this constant

598
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,840
regular nagging to make sure that

599
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,360
project files are stored up it's this

600
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,200
whole ring roll and if someone's left

601
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,840
the company and a company comes back

602
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,200
after the pen test firm's not going to

603
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,799
have those files that's a pretty common

604
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,919
problem that happens so kaido taking

605
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,080
these new approaches not only makes it

606
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,919
so much more elegant for me as a bug

607
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,880
bounty tester but as a penetration

608
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,520
tester i now have more control over my

609
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,679
environment and

610
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,799
you know

611
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,440
a more clean way of structuring all of

612
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,120
my logging and testing around an asset

613
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,640
if you're a bug bounty hunter you could

614
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,840
even say

615
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
have your projects organized there pick

616
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,919
up a target resume and use that as a

617
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,520
long-term log storage instead of having

618
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
to copy everything around the place

619
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,039
this isn't an advertisement this isn't

620
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,919
paid

621
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,600
i just i'm really excited about this

622
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,559
product

623
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,039
and i struggle these days to get

624
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,640
that level of excitement about something

625
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,320
new it is it is

626
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
uh really groundbreaking and really

627
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,760
interesting to see

628
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
uh that not only has someone come into

629
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
the proxy space and disrupted it but

630
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,799
they've disrupted it by really solving

631
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,600
core problems um that have sat on the

632
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,360
table for years and no one's touched so

633
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
it's great to see

634
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,760
that kind of innovation moving forward

635
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
so i was originally going to round

636
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
things out covering truffle hog because

637
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,280
it really excites me i i was privileged

638
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,880
enough to get early access to that thank

639
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
you dylan and crew that's amazing um i

640
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,600
do have future content coming up on that

641
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
where i'll go deeper but

642
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
i didn't see the reason to do it here

643
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
mostly because dylan avery's doing a

644
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,600
talk at naham khan which is amazing um

645
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
and naam seki himself has also put out

646
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,679
really awesome content at that so i'd

647
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,120
really encourage you i don't know if

648
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
it's before this or and you've got to

649
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,799
catch some recordings after this catch

650
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,480
dylan's talk i've been chatting to him

651
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,880
this week and i know he's putting a lot

652
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
of effort in i've also heard from ben

653
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
like he's really excited about that talk

654
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,520
and um

655
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,280
what better way to learn about it than

656
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,159
from the creator themselves and uh for

657
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,120
ben he's done a really good video on

658
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
this where it goes deep already

659
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,960
the part i'll add the thing that excites

660
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,840
me

661
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,559
is

662
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,520
from a bug perspective

663
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
the things that cause incidents with

664
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,480
customers are things that

665
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,360
cause a negative disruption and

666
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,400
key hacks has been a great way of

667
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
cataloging keys and ways to test them

668
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,000
but sometimes people you know look for

669
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
ways to test them that cause incidents

670
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,280
and cause calls with customers and other

671
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
incidents that um

672
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
they add overhead and they can make it

673
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,799
you know people still get paid and it

674
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,720
just it makes it more elongated to get

675
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,840
to that point because we've now got to

676
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,360
talk to the customer and explain you

677
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,280
know how this process happened

678
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
truffle hog i think is going to solve a

679
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,039
lot of that it adds a lot of safe means

680
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,640
of testing keys they put a lot of

681
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,799
thought and a lot of effort for the

682
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,320
hundreds of keys that they're gathering

683
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,000
up to make sure they're testing them in

684
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,360
a way that won't cause a production

685
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,559
disruption

686
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,679
so the director in me is excited by that

687
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,679
and what that means it's innovation for

688
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,600
the bug bounty space that i think

689
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
normally would go unnoticed but i wanted

690
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
to kind of paint a target on it and say

691
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,960
look this is awesome

692
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,520
they've received funding they've put it

693
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,200
to the best benefit they could for the

694
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
community and create an awesome tool but

695
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,679
they've also designed it in a way that

696
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,760
works in a corporate environment

697
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
that's exciting for any tool that means

698
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,440
you can learn it and then take it into a

699
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,600
day job as a pen tester and not be

700
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,360
worried about a negative outcome so i

701
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,600
really encourage you to learn more about

702
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
truffle hog

703
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,559
it's new

704
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,760
but it is the best way now without

705
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,039
question to discover api keys and

706
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,880
credentials um that are sitting out

707
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,400
there in ascent when you're doing your

708
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
wide level recon

709
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,400
and uh

710
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,760
know whether you have a valid finding or

711
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,600
not because it will also help highlight

712
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,080
hey this is a test key that's no longer

713
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,640
in use and things like that so

714
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,240
catch that and

715
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,320
all of that said um this is the end of

716
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,880
