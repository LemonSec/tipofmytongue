1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,040
this is you send there and I'm going to

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,500
talk today about attacking white Targets

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,200
in big bouncy

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,540
so um who am I understand they are known

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,460
as USA 98g

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,099
I mean backbone cheese since 2014

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,520
approximately I'm also the CEO of Lobby

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,440
Minify which provides band testing

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,660
services to companies

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,400
so the subject of today is really

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,859
interesting because every time you might

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,279
get some white Targets in big monkey and

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,960
you're not sure where to start and how

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,200
to how to approach a Target and start um

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,480
hunting for breaks on it

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,880
so what are white scoop targets what

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,579
script targets refer to a system or

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,559
network that is being tested for

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,920
vulnerabilities over a large area

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,379
of range or components

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,960
so some examples of white sweep circuit

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,379
in background are obviously Yahoo Apple

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,579
FIS atlasan and you have other couple of

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,399
um really interesting targets and really

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,040
interesting by multiple

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,200
programs that I provide wild scoop

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
targets

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,760
so what's some interesting

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,180
in choosing white targets when doing

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,799
back bouncy

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,159
so because of the size of the of the

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,140
scoop

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,479
um there is like a bigger chance for you

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,340
to find vulnerabilities because the

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,080
scope is really

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,780
um large and so you might find some

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,939
assets that other hackers haven't hacked

38
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,240
on yet and that you might be lucky

39
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,720
finding those um

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,180
other people haven't found yet

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,880
so the main interesting part in this um

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
in this in this um whole thing is

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,799
finding the targets that others haven't

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,600
hacked on

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,640
so this increases your chance to find

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,159
liabilities as you have a bigger surface

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,820
to explore

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,700
what are the challenges that come into

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,799
place when hacking on this kind of

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,180
targets

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,520
so the scoop is too large and you don't

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,560
know where to start

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,540
it's easy to miss vulnerabilities

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,660
without using a systematic approach

55
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,599
because you're just like random opening

56
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,700
this link closing this lane and then you

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,680
you get lost you don't know where just

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,379
where you have

59
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,500
stopped your last um hiking session

60
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,200
and as it's a wise group targets it

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,060
means also that other hackers might be

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,300
hacking on it because they are also

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,280
um looking for the low-hanging fruits

64
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,200
so the strategies is start by doing your

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,840
casual subdomain enumeration

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,980
and then use a lot of

67
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,680
permutation based on the words found on

68
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,780
the target so that means that for

69
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,400
example if I find

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,860
um a sub domain list for this target.com

71
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,560
that I'm hacking on I'm going to try to

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,560
grab as much words as possible from this

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,200
list that I had and then try to do some

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,379
permutation based on these words

75
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,840
so for example here

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,040
um when we use Google DNS by ships then

77
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,860
you might find for example for firstly

78
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,379
you might have

79
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,560
125 sub domains after using dualgns and

80
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,540
doing some permutations and resolving

81
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,720
again now you have way more sub domains

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,019
you have 172 sub domains

83
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,720
but that's just like

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,819
um a really small amount of supplements

85
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,640
you can find because by doing more more

86
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,120
and more permutation you're likely to to

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
be going to find many interesting

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,280
many interesting sub domain that other

89
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,659
people have haven't seen yet

90
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,239
so we need more subdomains what do we do

91
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,459
there is this new tool called regulator

92
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,239
that's a really good by um trumpet that

93
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,819
I have seen recently and so basically

94
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,739
what it does is that it does like some

95
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,739
intelligent permutation on the list that

96
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:11,580
you have

97
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,620
and so by using these tools after

98
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,339
grudginess you might

99
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,839
really get way most of the means that

100
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,940
you had because it's going to be to make

101
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,320
it better

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,560
um permutation list and once you resolve

103
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,479
that I bet that you are going to find

104
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,540
way more some domains um to hack on

105
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,540
what I usually love doing is that after

106
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,540
doing these bus steps I'm going again to

107
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,580
repeat the same process two or three

108
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,740
times to make sure that I get way more

109
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,320
sub domain that I had in the first place

110
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,479
so keep going deeper and

111
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,580
um don't hesitate to do full power

112
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,759
scanning on the subtle means found GUI

113
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,460
Wayback machine our ship archive.org

114
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,340
just grew up on the the links that you

115
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,199
can because everything is going to be

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,100
really

117
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,280
um useful for the next steps

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,740
you can also use Katana Goose spider

119
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,919
hackroller to to grow the subdomains and

120
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,919
save all the output in one file sort

121
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,380
unique and then you have a really good

122
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,919
list of um of family or really good

123
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,800
links or from targets you can hack on on

124
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
point some maybe PHP file other

125
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,300
interesting files that you might find

126
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,000
and start gripping for addressing

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,180
strings in this list of um crowded files

128
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,500
so for example I'm going to search for

129
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,919
for admin because I know that I'm good

130
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,520
at finding authentication

131
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,500
bypasses in admin panels

132
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,180
or maybe

133
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,820
um I'm going to look for application

134
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,340
that type of registration and points so

135
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,979
that I can do some authenticated scan uh

136
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,900
to educated testing

137
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,660
and maybe I'm going to hack on API so

138
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,759
I'm just going to search for apis and

139
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,139
start hiking on that

140
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,960
so use also darking often people just do

141
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,020
Google working but they don't do being

142
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,979
working Dr good working

143
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:15,360
ask.fm.king and

144
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,900
um while doing hiking on backbone

145
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,020
targets and docking I have found some

146
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,740
many cases where Bing does find

147
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,500
endpoints or subdomains or pages that

148
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,720
Google haven't found when talking on

149
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,620
Google

150
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,639
so don't leverage this powerful tools

151
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,699
and don't hesitate to try to talk on

152
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,440
every

153
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,240
um search engine that you find

154
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,520
so here let's go and start with some

155
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,979
real world examples so

156
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,840
um I had this company I was hacking on

157
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,060
that had a huge School

158
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,800
and after going through the previous

159
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,620
steps I found the following subdomain

160
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,340
which says like API something.target.com

161
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,100
and browsing to it it says like API pre

162
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,580
version number blah blah blah download

163
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,840
and this is the APK apks that um

164
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,660
the company is using for this for

165
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,280
employees there

166
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,699
I download all the apis and started

167
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,620
looking for some interesting and print

168
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,780
some interesting secrets and I have

169
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,800
found

170
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,139
nothing

171
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,319
so I copied the title of the page I've

172
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,840
pasted it on Google and Bing and I'm

173
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,580
just like trying to share some other

174
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,639
Pages using the same title and they have

175
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,080
found the same

176
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,440
um page on another subdomain but now it

177
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,000
give this gave me

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,620
um

179
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,020
um this gave me another page using the

180
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,860
same

181
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,020
the same like um

182
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,500
uh sending me the same app AP guys but

183
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,080
now with retail modification little

184
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,560
thing so we can see on the seats this

185
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
says 10 January

186
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,180
2022 while the other one back there said

187
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,360
9th of May 2022

188
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,419
and so this said this was like oops this

189
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,680
is going

190
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,960
um good because this is something that

191
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
happened from before let me download

192
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,060
this and see because obviously most of

193
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,699
the time the earlier version of

194
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,560
application are the one that contains

195
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,960
the most vulnerabilities and maybe if

196
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,719
it's a Dev version so maybe it can

197
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,539
contain some credentials

198
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,120
and bingo while opening the application

199
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,899
I have found this bunch of leaks in it

200
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,560
dot properties file that give me like

201
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,839
um really good access to every aspect of

202
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,200
that company I was lacking on

203
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,120
so we had OCTA secrets we had some SMS

204
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,640
apis we had a lot of other

205
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,180
um

206
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,560
credentials to services

207
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,839
so um I also found remote command

208
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,180
execution on this company sub domains

209
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,839
after doing permutation and with them

210
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,000
regulator and I found this some sub

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,100
domain that I didn't have so this is

212
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,140
obviously not the real

213
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,980
um

214
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,880
not the real subliment PGI but um when

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,620
you find some weight scoop when you're

216
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,899
hiking on Race targets don't hesitate to

217
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,600
collaborate and ask other hackers if

218
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,700
they have credentials to some panels

219
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,660
because

220
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,120
so I have found this um endpoint that is

221
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,880
upload in my I'm calling results from

222
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,640
Katana and stuff and

223
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,740
um I opened the link and I've seen that

224
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,140
it needs authentication there was there

225
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,380
was no register on points so I just GM

226
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,480
at like a friend of migrizzle and I

227
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,980
asked man do you have some good answer

228
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,080
for this application I know that you're

229
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,480
hacking on this um company and he says

230
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,459
yeah and I said okay

231
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,959
um do you want to collaborate and then

232
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,060
that's how we started

233
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,700
and we got um these three launchers and

234
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,580
then we can we could um find remote

235
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,440
common execution because I know that

236
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,700
there was there was an upload on point

237
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,720
and um so this one point um needed a

238
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,240
valid XLS file

239
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,940
um triggered a bit to include some ASP

240
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,700
code and when opening the file then

241
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,580
there was that could be executed on the

242
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,760
target

243
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,320
so

244
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
um other things is that you can use

245
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,320
Axiom to leverage speed of from scanning

246
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,740
because for example if you get 3 000

247
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,240
subdomains you're not going to be able

248
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,260
to put for us or who's the host in one

249
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,260
hour or two but by using Axiom with for

250
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,540
example 50 or

251
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,200
um 60

252
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,560
instances DPS is you can firstly get to

253
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,640
that in a matter of hours so I sent I

254
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,339
started brute forcing the subdomains I

255
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,399
had with Axiom and foof and it found

256
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,360
some interesting file to set GP

257
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,160
error.php so I know that a lot of people

258
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,500
mind just like skip okay it says like

259
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,839
error it might sound like four or four

260
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,760
error and stuff so it's not interesting

261
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,040
but when opening it

262
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,560
I have found that it was leaking the

263
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,200
database credentials because it had like

264
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,240
an error in this in the script

265
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,100
um going forward you can also use

266
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,440
Showdown door game because

267
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,100
um you can do like SSL company or

268
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,440
organization or with the fertility

269
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,320
National Services and then you can find

270
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,019
some IPS which doesn't have

271
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,140
um which don't have um hostname assigned

272
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,199
to

273
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
so a real world example of that is that

274
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,339
I have found this IP from should I'm

275
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,120
talking I'm moving to the IP directly it

276
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,380
just says

277
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,140
um you've been redirected to octave for

278
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,339
Authentication

279
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,880
and but um don't um don't forget that

280
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,640
you you have always to try to find some

281
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,700
face on the targets that will direct you

282
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,420
to login or or Octan points because some

283
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,519
ACLS might might not be really well

284
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,440
configured

285
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,720
and by doing choosing on that um

286
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,540
subdomain I have found this um this

287
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,019
endpoint that says BPL WS login

288
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,139
and by sending a post request to this um

289
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,680
to this endpoint I have seen unsupported

290
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,160
media type and so I have also found out

291
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,820
that it uses it it accepts XML data

292
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,000
so the application expects XMS data

293
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,459
maybe we can find some xcc here

294
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,220
and so firstly I have started testing a

295
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,279
bit and it was finally vulnerable to out

296
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,260
of bond um

297
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,100
um xxc and so here we had the DDT file

298
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,800
on my server which contained this um

299
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,700
this entity which sends back a file to

300
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,519
my web collaborator

301
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,519
and after sending the blind xss payload

302
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,820
a blind ECC play payload and hosting the

303
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,000
DDT on my system then I could see that

304
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,279
the application was sending back the

305
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,440
data of the file I requested to my

306
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,820
collaborator on point

307
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,920
so another really good example of how to

308
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,320
approach good white scope targets is

309
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,019
doing more being talking because

310
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,540
everyone is talking on Google so maybe

311
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,260
you might have more more chances trying

312
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,399
to be on other search on Giants

313
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,440
so um Sandy copyright company 2022 being

314
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,980
Dorking it revealed a new domain that I

315
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,899
did not have in my data set

316
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,940
and it was time for me to find some

317
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,980
vulnerabilities and looking at the

318
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,839
application I have started testing

319
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,579
around and trying to find some

320
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,100
interesting things and here I have seen

321
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,139
that

322
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,720
the The Good the session cookie was

323
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,660
vulnerable to SQL injection and so by

324
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,820
sending this some sleep payload I can

325
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,660
see that the applications sleeping 20

326
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,360
um 20 000 milliseconds it's probably

327
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
that it's doing time tool on the back

328
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,899
end in some functions

329
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,260
um so the strategies mostly it's to use

330
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,180
tools such as

331
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,760
um monitoring your subdomains and try to

332
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,620
monitor keep up to date with some sub

333
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,959
domains to be able to hack on the

334
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,500
targets because before other hackers do

335
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,660
um focus on your strengths for example

336
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,779
if you see PHP or maybe if you say

337
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,120
aspects maybe this can turn you on and

338
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,100
start you know spending more more time

339
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,620
on the target

340
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,779
collaborate with other hackers because

341
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,519
obviously

342
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,860
um together we hit harder

343
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,560
and sharks of domains sharp credentials

344
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,720
show interesting on points maybe you

345
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,519
don't have the no Nations that someone

346
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,959
else's have

347
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,060
be some be consistent don't give up

348
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,440
easily it's not because you are not

349
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,180
finally get back today or tomorrow that

350
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,279
will never be finding a bug on this some

351
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,199
specific company

352
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,660
and the most important of all for me is

353
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,060
to stick to a target for at least two or

354
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,399
three months from myself I think that

355
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,339
this is a perfect time to know that um

356
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,519
okay I'm done hacking this target I want

357
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,760
to to switch but um hiking on my script

358
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,040
targets requires a lot of time to know

359
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,260
exactly how everything is built up from

360
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,040
the

361
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,699
Target side and know some tweaks that

362
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,620
might work on these targets

363
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,100
so um try to stick to a target for a

364
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,800
good reasonable amount of time to to to

365
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,320
hack on

366
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,519
also um while doing this um this um

367
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,180
talk I open I AIS out and now you can

368
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,899
use you can leverage chat open AI to try

369
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,360
to code some tools that you've always

370
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,839
dreamed of so for example here I ask um

371
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,399
chat that open AI to

372
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,079
read the golang tool that's going to

373
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,740
search for secrets in a list of your uh

374
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,399
all of links I will send it and then

375
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,920
directly it's really easy to to build

376
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,360
tools based on your creativity here

377
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,339
thank you for your time and thank you

378
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,980
for watching this um talk and listening

379
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,259
to me and I'll see you soon thank you
