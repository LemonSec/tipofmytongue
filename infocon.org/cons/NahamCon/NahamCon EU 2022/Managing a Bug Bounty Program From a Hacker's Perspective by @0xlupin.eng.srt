1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,159
hi everyone and welcome to my

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,500
presentation managing a burgundy program

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,080
from a hacker's perspective my name is

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,320
Ronnie uh you may also know me as Lupine

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,360
on the internet I'm a senior security

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,560
engineer at manomano uh since 2021 uh

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,420
basically manomano is the European

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,640
leader specializing in DIY Home

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,279
Improvement and Gathering online to sum

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,480
up we sell stuff on a European level

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,880
I've been co-leading manomano's

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,079
backbending program since my arrival and

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,840
uh I've been doing backpences on hack

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,260
one for three years and a half I think

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,800
uh basically my daily job is to try to

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,600
hack my Romano in order to find

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,700
vulnerabilities and then help the

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,760
technical teams to fix them before my

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,579
actors try to export them uh basically

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,460
doing backbending uh on my numbers

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,039
internally

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,739
uh to begin this presentation I need to

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,019
tell you a bit about Manu mano's

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,600
backbending history

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,200
uh basically uh in June 2019 manamana

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,140
created their own security team and

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,119
since the very beginning the mindset of

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,700
the security team was to have an

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,080
offensive mindset and we started to do

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,619
uh offensive security and red teaming

31
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,759
and very quickly we decided to create a

32
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,020
bug Bunty program in December 2019.

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,860
uh basically our belief is that hackers

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,439
are an extension of our security team

35
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,960
and that they can bring more diversity

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,020
and new methodologies uh when finding

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,780
vulnerabilities uh so we launch our

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,299
ability program on the yogusha which is

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,880
a French platform and at the time there

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,979
were mostly European hikers that were

41
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,040
hunting on our scope

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,860
and as I said the goal is to find more

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,860
creative vulnerabilities to have a more

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,259
thorough security tests and to cover a

45
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,739
larger scope that the small security the

46
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,420
small security team at the time called

47
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,940
the cover

48
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,140
and then in 2021 we decided uh to join

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,459
hack one

50
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,640
um a little bit after my arrival and the

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,220
mindset behind that was that we wanted

52
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,920
to have a bigger pool of talent uh that

53
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,620
could hack on our scope

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,379
um we set the goals to try to expand our

55
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,840
scope I think it was just an addicts

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,720
that said that uh bug bunches should not

57
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,180
have any scope because maisha's actors

58
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,780
do not actually have a scope and that's

59
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,819
something that I really like and so

60
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,920
that's why we are trying to expand our

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
scope more and also increase the 20

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
amount to keep being competitive on

63
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,879
haikon

64
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,459
so what was like to when I to manage a

65
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,239
Monumental program like what he's like

66
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,580
uh basically one day we were in the room

67
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,180
uh with Jill which is my manager uh

68
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,700
Fabian which is the VP platform and me

69
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,340
at the time absolutely not knowing how

70
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,159
to manage a program and they basically

71
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,319
told me okay now you're in charge of our

72
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,140
Ubuntu program uh be creative do

73
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,900
everything contrarian uh do stuff

74
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,620
differently and I'm like okay

75
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,319
um but I'm supposed to do now right that

76
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,920
there is not a book to be creative when

77
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,580
managing a vibrancy program and so very

78
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,459
quickly the ideas came to flourish and I

79
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,260
felt like a challenge in candy store

80
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,120
because they told me you can do whatever

81
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,260
you want and uh I took this opportunity

82
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,739
to actually try to create the best

83
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,940
printing program uh that are called

84
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,959
uh so what is my recipe uh to cook the

85
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,860
best Bunty program uh first ingredient

86
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,939
is to have a great policy uh basically a

87
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,100
great policy is to have a good

88
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,660
explanation of the scope of your

89
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,478
Technologies and your assets so for

90
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,000
instance there is the main marketplace

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
and there is different tlds it's always

92
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,940
great to explain that all the tlds have

93
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,220
the same underlying Technologies and

94
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,800
that finding one vulnerability on the

95
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,919
one TLD

96
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,660
is like a duplicate of finding the same

97
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,460
on a node TLD

98
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,139
uh for instance that's a great

99
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,180
explanation and to be transparent and

100
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,699
clear with the hunters and also as I

101
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,400
said uh we wanted to expand our scope

102
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,120
right and so I added uh this uh little

103
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,900
item to the scope which says that any uh

104
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,740
personal uh identifiable information of

105
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,080
our customers and employees or sellers

106
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,320
are in scope basically the philosophy

107
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,340
behind that is that we do not want to

108
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,620
care about the entry point but more

109
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,100
about the results of the vulnerability

110
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,880
of the impact really and so that's

111
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,060
actually a mindset that comes from gdpr

112
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,600
because as a European company we are

113
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,620
bounded to gdpr and a leak of data on

114
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,440
any of our assets on even our third

115
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,639
parties where our responsibility is

116
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,860
engaged uh that's like some kind of

117
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,919
legal PR staff

118
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,500
this is like our responsibility and so I

119
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,800
feel that we're also responsible to add

120
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,840
that to our Bunty program and to be

121
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,600
transparent that we want to receive any

122
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,979
kind of report where there is

123
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,440
information leakage because that's our

124
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,100
responsibility

125
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,259
um then also we try to be as clear as

126
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,479
possible on the reward table and that's

127
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
why uh we added a hard-coded bug printy

128
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,039
table basically if you get one of the

129
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,720
vulnerabilities that is written on this

130
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,340
table for instance a remote car

131
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,139
execution on the marketplace this is

132
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,419
automatically a ten thousand dollar real

133
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,580
world there is no discussion about that

134
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,680
right so we are coded some kind of

135
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,740
rewards uh for instance as I say the

136
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,780
remote execution ten thousand dollars

137
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,960
Mass customers data ex situation the

138
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,080
same ten thousand dollars uh if you can

139
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,080
get a cash poisoning denial of service

140
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,139
it will be for instance 5000 uh five

141
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,240
thousand dollars so if you manage to

142
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,819
cash poison or JavaScript our CSS page

143
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,060
that's super impactful for us

144
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,860
um I don't know one click base I can

145
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,500
take over uh will be also five thousand

146
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,419
dollars etc etc

147
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,720
and every vulnerability uh that do not

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,500
fall on the table from another table

149
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,560
also I want to be clear that I do not

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,860
want clay jacking basically you will

151
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,319
miss one dollar on the next report if

152
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,240
you bring me a clickjacking on the table

153
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,580
so please don't

154
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,000
uh and as I said every uh booties that

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,220
do not fall on the first table falls on

156
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,460
the second table which is a way more

157
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,160
classical table a sliding table where

158
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,220
for our web application the low uh

159
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,520
between 200 to 250 and the critical are

160
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,620
between

161
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,160
2500 and 3000 and for mobile application

162
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,380
there is small bonuses because we are

163
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,479
rich said in finding for abilities on

164
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,919
our mobile application in general

165
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,020
um and then for me in a good policy we

166
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,419
need to try to help the hunters as I

167
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,259
said we are not trying to you know have

168
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,360
this philosophy of blackberry tea when

169
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,900
we say okay uh there are external actors

170
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,539
as maitius actors they do not have any

171
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,720
information so we give them a complete

172
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,120
Black Box and they need like to find

173
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,860
more abilities just like that and I'm

174
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,020
like that's not how we are supposed to

175
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,440
do our job right and so that's why uh

176
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,379
I've been trying to help the hunters

177
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,560
finding vulnerabilities uh to and just

178
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,580
writing some advices in the policy uh so

179
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,680
first of all there is the general rules

180
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,740
that add like usual we are hack one

181
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,599
email uh try to not did us with your

182
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,000
scanning because you know uh we all know

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,279
how to run new clay in the team so

184
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,220
that's not useful for us and if you can

185
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,740
try to hide the exact one header it's

186
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,680
always great for us to analyze uh the

187
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,420
logs down

188
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,660
um we added a captured bug uh basically

189
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,899
if you think that you compromised the

190
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,380
the data of other customers instead of

191
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,100
accessing that uh uh not consenting

192
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,040
customers you can just access an ID that

193
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,100
we provide to you and you'll find a flag

194
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,519
in a certain part of the account

195
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,560
and so if you retrieve the flag we

196
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,080
automatically giving you a Bounty again

197
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,459
no discussion about that

198
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,980
because that our Tech teams wrote were

199
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,660
really transparent about the

200
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Technologies we use uh the the softwares

201
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,660
were running etc etc and so uh I've been

202
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,300
trying to add some articles to

203
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,000
understand more our ecosystem and how

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,800
the marketplace is running

205
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,080
I about at this one how to get a lead

206
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,519
booty

207
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,459
in my opinion if you get an exercise

208
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,880
with just an alert box

209
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
I do not see any impact because

210
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,860
sometimes there is a different

211
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,300
components like I don't know maybe there

212
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,480
is a CSP that you didn't know maybe it's

213
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,120
hard to get an extra share correctly

214
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,760
because there is a lot of complex adders

215
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,640
to add in the request etc etc so if you

216
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,339
have an exercise show me the impact and

217
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,100
actually I'm going to reward more if you

218
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,420
show the the impact and so that that's

219
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,700
always great to try to chain your

220
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,980
vulnerabilities and always try to get

221
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,580
the best impact possible I know this is

222
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,560
not true for every blackbency program

223
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,899
but on our program we really want to see

224
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,100
that

225
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,440
and then we'll open

226
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,620
ports and other questions Etc if you

227
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,220
have a doubt always communicate with us

228
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,560
again we are not like going to tell you

229
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,720
we are in a black box and you cannot

230
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,300
communicate with us actually I've had

231
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,420
some Hunters that called me uh and told

232
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,920
me okay I have the beginning of a

233
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,660
vulnerability but I don't know how to

234
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,040
explode it I'm always like okay I'm

235
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,019
going to explode it with you and they

236
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,380
were like why I don't know I just want

237
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,079
it I I just want to help people yeah an

238
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,600
extension our security team again we are

239
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,360
not trying to slow you while trying to

240
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,959
have a value from the hunters so if we

241
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,339
can help to explore the vulnerability

242
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,660
let's go why not

243
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,880
and uh then yeah we're trolling a little

244
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,180
bit on the policy uh because again

245
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,860
even if you want to find vulnerabilities

246
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,459
uh on a Marketplace we are 100 secure so

247
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,820
why bothering right

248
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,220
uh actually this joke comes from a

249
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,519
conference that we did with uh Sean Alex

250
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,519
uh Alex Alex Chapman and Jonathan Bowman

251
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,120
uh where um I think it was Alex that

252
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,720
tells told some companies to add this uh

253
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,940
disclaimer because it will actually

254
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,380
trigger people to find more

255
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,940
vulnerabilities and I was like that's a

256
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,200
great idea I'm going to do that

257
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,620
um the second uh ingredient

258
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,480
um when you want to have a great

259
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,000
pregnancy program is to have clear

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,360
internal processes uh when coming to

261
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,399
handling reports

262
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,800
basically when we're receiving a report

263
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,980
on our program our goal is to answer as

264
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,740
fast as possible uh we do not want to

265
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,200
make the hunter wait and if we can enter

266
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,320
in in 10 minutes we will try to do it if

267
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,680
it takes more time it means that we are

268
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,779
actually trying to understand the report

269
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,760
or that

270
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,800
um I don't know where in the middle of a

271
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,459
proof of concept etc etc so we always

272
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,880
try to have a great slas and in the day

273
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,420
that the team actually handle the report

274
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,420
and so after handling the report like

275
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,040
the first response was trying to

276
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,079
understand the vulnerability uh this is

277
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,600
an example of an ID or uh that we had on

278
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,820
our program where basically there was a

279
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,600
post request on API V1 reviews uh where

280
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,480
in the Json you call the change the

281
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,420
pillow the article rating and the seller

282
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,980
rating uh of any reviews on the platform

283
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,980
so it was quite impactful and then we

284
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,740
denied availability uh we denied that we

285
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,459
didn't find the probability before them

286
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:34,740
that's just a joke but when we managed

287
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,560
to reproduce our ability well then going

288
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,160
to uh three age by asking why we invited

289
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,040
this Hunter on the program

290
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,220
um and once it's a trade we are going to

291
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,139
try to escalate availability for the

292
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,260
hunter uh basically

293
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,560
um as I said we are not here to slow the

294
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,459
hunters or being unfairful we want to

295
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,860
bring more impact to the vulnerability

296
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,300
and we want to reward the hunters

297
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,240
um com like according to the impact

298
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,639
right so for instance Luca will tell me

299
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,600
I bypassed the filter

300
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,519
uh kylian will tell me I chained the

301
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,680
verbility to get an account takeover and

302
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,279
I will be like

303
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,279
well amazing now we need to reward more

304
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,260
uh that that's great that's something

305
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,500
that we really like to do again uh we we

306
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,360
want to help the answers bring more

307
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,160
impact to the reports

308
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,060
and so uh to take take an example of a

309
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,519
kind of escalation that we did in April

310
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,399
4th 2022 uh We've rewarded the

311
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,540
availability as a low vulnerability with

312
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,880
a little bonus because we really liked

313
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,660
the report

314
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,860
um and then in October 5th uh we we said

315
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,100
uh okay maybe the probability is a bit

316
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,660
more impactful than we thought because

317
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,519
we managed to escalate the vulnerability

318
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,180
internally after a lot of testing a lot

319
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,180
of things so we escalated to to high and

320
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,600
then we rewarded uh the hunter for the

321
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,540
escalation that that we did with a one

322
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,699
thousand dollar bonus on the report so

323
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,100
that's the kind of spirit that we try to

324
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,519
have on the program if we can put

325
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,279
10 hours into escalating a report for a

326
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,320
hunter we will do it because first of

327
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,300
all it's really fun for us to get a

328
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,720
report uh to to exploit availability uh

329
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,839
too because we have access to a staging

330
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,000
environment and we can actually cause

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,760
damage to an environment

332
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,519
however we want at the security team and

333
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,620
so if we want like if someone is

334
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,500
reporting us a does we are going to try

335
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,839
to dust the staging environment until

336
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,600
it's completely down uh just to

337
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,459
understand if the reports actually work

338
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,279
in the real scenario

339
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,139
um so that's the kind of stuff that we

340
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,240
do at my mano

341
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,000
and then when we managed to escape the

342
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,940
zombie to uh here comes the rating of

343
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,079
the variability

344
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,720
so first of all we are going to use the

345
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,339
CVSs score and just to tell you I hate

346
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,579
the CVS score it actually doesn't work

347
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,320
for a lot of different vulnerabilities

348
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,620
for instance you get an idol leaking all

349
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,139
the data of our customers it will be

350
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,139
rated 7.5 on the CBS score which is

351
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,019
nonsense because actually as a European

352
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,300
platform we're about to gdpr and there

353
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,779
is way more impact to your confidential

354
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,240
data leaking so the CVS score is just to

355
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,779
give us an idea of the vulnerability and

356
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,240
then we are going to take in account

357
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,880
environmental impact depending on the

358
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,000
type of vulnerabilities on which hosts

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,880
the vulnerability is impacting etc etc

360
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,699
and we try to re-understand the logic

361
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,040
that was broken so that's like the

362
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,720
breakdown that we do for the technical

363
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,179
impact and then we move to the analysis

364
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,819
is there any proof of expectation in our

365
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,179
logs if yes it means that okay the the

366
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,740
impact will be higher because actually

367
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,240
someone managed to exploit the

368
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,540
vulnerability uh otherwise if we say the

369
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,520
impact is the is the same as the

370
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,140
technical impact

371
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,860
um from how much time uh there is a risk

372
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,660
um for how much time we have been

373
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,820
exposed to this vulability the longer

374
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,520
work where we've been exposed the more

375
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,539
probable someone could exploit it and so

376
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,660
um we think okay there is maybe a higher

377
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,140
risk with a formative a bit three years

378
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,780
then we try to contact uh the technical

379
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,900
teams responsible for the feature and uh

380
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,419
we try we're trying to understand uh

381
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,640
their scope uh technical teams know

382
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,980
their scope way better than us because

383
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,620
they literally developed the features

384
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,440
and so we're asking them if they can try

385
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,419
to describe the vulnerability why not

386
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,940
letting the developers try to exploit a

387
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,280
little bit it's always fun to have this

388
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,039
kind of conversation and then we are

389
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,840
trying to understand the difficulty of

390
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,419
fixing if it will take three quarters to

391
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,299
fix a vulnerability uh it means that we

392
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,059
need to add a logging and monitoring and

393
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,360
so it erase a little bit uh the the

394
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,299
impact in our assessment and then we are

395
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,480
trying to summing up everything and and

396
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,640
we are going to rate the vulnerability

397
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,360
in one of the critical high medium blog

398
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,460
category but even those kind of

399
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,340
segmentation when we are on the spectrum

400
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,760
of impacts it's super hard to put like

401
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,740
uh something is medium or something

402
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,960
inside so that's why we are trying to

403
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,860
award some bonuses when we think that

404
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,879
it's in the between

405
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,940
um and talking about bonuses uh we

406
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,500
actually have different kind of bonuses

407
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,280
there is one for uh uh creating a

408
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,740
nuclear template as I said we're running

409
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,160
sometime new clay uh ourselves uh so no

410
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,260
need to run but if you found the

411
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,900
vulnerability that nuclear didn't uh

412
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,120
well it's always great to to have the

413
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,179
template and so we are going to award a

414
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,000
100 bonus uh if you want to add the

415
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,760
template to your real report

416
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,539
uh and also we are awarding uh for uh

417
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,260
retesting uh because if I'm taking uh

418
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,679
time uh for how if I'm asking a hunter

419
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,620
to take time I need to pay that time for

420
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,860
me it's normal right and uh every

421
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,720
program that is not doing that I don't

422
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,059
understand why they are not doing that

423
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,059
but I'm actually paying the reticent

424
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,720
and then the last recipe is adding a lot

425
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,740
of memes uh actually we are adding so

426
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,280
much memes that it's a prerequisite in

427
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,640
our report template uh so you write the

428
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,340
report the way you like right uh we are

429
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,880
not going to judge uh if the report is

430
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,100
Well written uh we're again maybe so

431
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,740
what bonuses and everything but please

432
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,660
add meme

433
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,200
I really liked the memes of the

434
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,020
community and uh actually I'm going to

435
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,200
want a one dollar bonus uh for any memes

436
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,660
that we submitted

437
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,820
um this is just for the joke that I'm

438
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,400
doing that but actually a lot of people

439
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,320
like this joke

440
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,880
and

441
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,160
um it helped us actually to retain

442
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,400
Talent uh that way because we are trying

443
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,500
to be fun we are trying to be fair and

444
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,039
we want to show that we understand uh

445
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,600
the community and that we understand

446
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,419
this world and so if you send a meme we

447
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,340
are going to order one dollar and people

448
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,679
are going to be like oh this program is

449
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,360
cool this program is fun I'm going to

450
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,700
try to hunt more on this program so this

451
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,520
is also a way for us to retain uh Talent

452
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,900
on our program to find more

453
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,240
vulnerabilities uh so it's quite fun

454
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,760
and uh also a good ingredient for our

455
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,140
recipe is um to create uh a slack

456
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,500
Channel and having an invite management

457
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,940
of our Hunters uh basically we wanted to

458
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,220
create a slack so uh people called

459
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,760
Pingas really quickly DM us if they have

460
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,299
any question or if they need to uh

461
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,159
um they need help to exploit a certain

462
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,659
vulnerability

463
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,840
I think more programs uh should do that

464
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,120
there is a lot of

465
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,539
um of questions sometimes that that we

466
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,320
have as Hunters uh like is that in scope

467
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,419
can I do that do you give me permission

468
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,059
of doing that etc etc and so having a

469
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,419
slack is really great and as I said I've

470
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,520
been on a call with some Hunters

471
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,919
actually to exploit vulnerabilities with

472
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,200
them so it's always great to have that

473
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,720
kind of conversation and actually for

474
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,500
managing our invites uh we added a rule

475
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,440
that if you find a vulnerability medium

476
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,340
or higher you can invite two friends per

477
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,220
report so for instance if you report a

478
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,740
medium availability you can invite two

479
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,220
more people and then if um you find

480
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,559
another high report two weeks later you

481
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,440
can add two more people to our program

482
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,440
we we encourage a collaboration it's

483
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,020
always great to see a hunter's

484
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,260
collaborate together and that system

485
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,400
actually for us is really great because

486
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,059
instead of inviting automatically

487
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:55,980
hunters and letting hakawan invite the

488
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,700
hunters we can actually pick ourselves

489
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,919
the people that we want on our program

490
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,740
people that maybe we know of that we

491
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,480
think they are passionate they are

492
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,500
really good they are talented and

493
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,960
um and so we can invite them and then

494
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,539
they are going to invite people peers of

495
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,340
them and so people with the same

496
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,460
mentality in general and so we can grow

497
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,539
our program uh re-progressively but at

498
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:28,500
the same time retaining uh quality and I

499
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,620
think crowdsourcing is amazing when

500
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,500
Secrets who think that way instead of

501
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,720
you know opening to everyone you are

502
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,760
going to open to a small community and

503
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,039
this community will want to add more

504
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,880
people like them and you can retain a

505
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,380
great

506
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,780
um you know a great talent pool and at

507
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,200
the same time a great quality of reports

508
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,890
and

509
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,299
[Music]

510
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,500
um

511
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,820
and yeah

512
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,340
so

513
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,419
how how this recipe tastes is it working

514
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,840
so far uh yeah it's working great we

515
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,480
have great feedbacks from the

516
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,539
researchers so far a lot of people like

517
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,240
Ubuntu program I like our memes like the

518
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,799
fact that we put Emojis everywhere

519
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,220
um they they realize sometimes the the

520
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,600
time of response or how we are deciding

521
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,640
on ubunti because we are trying to

522
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,580
comment as as much as possible and be

523
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,760
100 transparent about what's happening

524
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,679
uh for instance I'm sometimes I'm

525
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,659
writing our internal processes to them

526
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,000
and I'm like okay that's what we have

527
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,100
been doing I'm going to update you in

528
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,059
two days

529
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,460
Etc so you know clear communication is

530
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,799
always great and

531
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:50,520
um

532
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,520
and and yeah like we have amazing

533
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,400
feedbacks and I'm really glad because we

534
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,220
have an amazing community of hunters and

535
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,820
it feels great uh to manage this uh

536
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,220
Bunty program because we have a strong

537
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,700
and but little community that is quite

538
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,820
active and always try to find more

539
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,700
vulnerabilities and so I hope that some

540
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,000
of you major a program uh in the future

541
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
and try uh to break us but not too hard

542
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,860
please

543
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,500
we have a wallet to respect

544
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,559
but um anyway uh that's it for my

545
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
presentation on what is like to managing

546
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,520
a black booty program from a hiker's

547
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,919
perspective as I said we're trying to be

548
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,200
as much contrarian as the standard in

549
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,860
the backbend industry so far and uh let

550
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,000
me know if you have any kind of

551
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
feedbacks any stuff that we can do

552
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,900
better and uh Jam me if you want to join

553
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,940
the program and maybe I will invite you

554
