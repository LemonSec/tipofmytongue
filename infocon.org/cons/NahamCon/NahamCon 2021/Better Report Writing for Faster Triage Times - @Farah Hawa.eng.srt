00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,280
hi everyone welcome to my talk so

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,120
as you can tell today i'm gonna talk

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,359
about better report writing for

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,160
faster triage times so let me first

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,240
introduce myself and then we can get

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,400
right into it

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
so my name is farah hawa and i work

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
as an application security engineer at

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,279
buck crowd

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,840
which means that i am a triager at

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,880
backroud

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,840
and i'm also a youtuber i have a youtube

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,400
channel called farah hawa where i post

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,719
bug bounty tutorials and technical

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,880
tutorials about web application testing

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,040
and i also interview some amazing people

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,320

so definitely check out my youtube

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,440
channel um shameless self promo

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
and i'm also a bug bounty hunter

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,160
whenever i get time from all of that

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,199
so let's uh so let me tell you uh what

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,039
we're gonna explore today

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,039
so first we're gonna answer the question

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,719
why do some reports take

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,359
so long to be triaged and once we're

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,160
done with that

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,920
i'm gonna move on to give you some tips

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,319
on how you can write better reproduction

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:04,879
steps

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,360
and how you can show impact in your

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
report

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
and these tips have come from my point

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,479
of view as a triager

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,040
so i'm just going to share that with you

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,560
so you can help whoever's

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
on the other side of the screen validate

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
your bug and triage it faster

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
so let's begin so

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,600
let let's answer the question why do

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,560
some reports

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,079
take so long to get triaged so the main

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,880
reason is

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
extended communication between triager

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,240
and researcher

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,960
this means that um probably the triager

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,240
asks too many questions

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,840
and the researcher gets back and then

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
there's a lot of back and forth which

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,720
sometimes take the

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,960
which sometimes takes days probably

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,759
weeks

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,720
um and the reason why all of this

54
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,479
communication comes up in the first

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:52,960
place

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
is because the original report does not

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,560
mention

58
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,280
clear reproduction steps or it does not

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,719
define the impact

60
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,799
of the bug clearly and that's why

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,000
there's a lot of sharing

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,119
and lots of delays basically

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,758
so let me give you some tips on how you

64
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,479
can write

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,360
better reproduction steps and remember

66
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,840
that the

67
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,640
end goal of your reproduction steps

68
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,440
should be

69
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
to allow the triager to follow those

70
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,280
step by step

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,720
and then avoid any mistakes

72
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
so this will also allow us to follow it

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,400
and then

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,319
like send it to the customer as fast as

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,560
possible so let me start with some

76
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,599
don'ts first

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,599
of what you should avoid when writing a

78
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,440
report so the first thing is

79
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,400
don't write long paragraphs uh they can

80
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
be really hard to scan and if you have

81
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,400
something important to mention

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
then try to make it in a point form or

83
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,400
make it really short and easily readable

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,840
paragraphs

85
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,560
the second thing is to not include any

86
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,480
kind of sensitive information in your

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,120
report

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
and sensitive information includes

89
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,159
cookies

90
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,519
credentials tokens so basically anything

91
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,879
that you're putting in your report which

92
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,560
includes any screenshots

93
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
um the steps all of that should not have

94
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,720
anything sensitive

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
and lastly do not use a report template

96
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,519
so try to write your original report

97
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
don't use a template and the reason for

98
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
that is because when

99
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,560
researchers use templates they end up

100
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,200
including

101
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,840
information that's way too much and

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
probably not even necessary

103
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
so now that we're done with the don'ts

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,040
let me tell you what you should do

105
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
so the first thing that you should do is

106
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,080
write short

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,879
and clear steps so as you can see in

108
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,080
this example

109
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,760
the steps on the left and the steps on

110
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,519
the right are communicating the same

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,319
thing

112
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,799
but just by looking at both of them you

113
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,440
can tell

114
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,760
that the steps on the left are much

115
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,799
easier to pass and much easier to read

116
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,959
and if a triager looks at the steps on

117
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,319
the right they will think that

118
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,280
it's an extremely complicated task when

119
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,040
it is actually not

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,920
right so triages will definitely be

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
thankful to you if they can scan

122
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,000
simpler steps rather than pass those

123
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,760
long paragraphs

124
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
and you should try to write short and

125
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,120
clear steps instead of writing

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
long paragraphs where too many actions

127
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,320
are clubbed into one step

128
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,040
so let's go on to the next point and

129
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,520
that is adding a proof of concept

130
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
so sometimes bug hunters don't include

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,320
proof of concepts and that means that

132
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,199
triages

133
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,960
have to spend that extra time to

134
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
reproduce the submission

135
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,960
and in some cases what happens is that

136
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,320
they do not succeed because

137
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,919
there's something missing or they make a

138
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,000
mistake and then again that leads to

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
asking questions and causes delays and

140
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,880
all of that

141
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,280
so if you include a poc it allows us to

142
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,440
do it faster and validate it send it to

143
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,720
the customer

144
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
so your proof of concept doesn't even

145
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
need to be anything that's

146
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,479
really complicated it can be quite

147
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,199
simple so let's look at these examples

148
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,120
um a reflected or stored xss poc

149
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,759
can simply be a link that once the

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,120
triager clicks on it

151
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,199
it shows that the javascript is being

152
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,960
run on the victim's browser

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
another example is using a link for

154
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,600
a get based open redirect poc where

155
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
again if the triager clicks on it they

156
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
just get redirected to the attacker

157
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
control domain

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,280
and lastly if you have a post-based csrf

159
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,160
all you can do is show an html file as a

160
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,039
poc

161
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
and uh when the triager opens that on

162
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
their browser and submits the request it

163
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,960
makes the changes on their account or

164
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,080
you know whatever the

165
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,039
impact of your csrf is in that case so

166
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,680
these are some examples of simpler pocs

167
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,400
uh but in case your proof of concept has

168
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,880
to be

169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,120
complicated for some reason or if it's

170
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
extremely complicated then try to leave

171
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,360
an

172
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
explanation about it so that uh the

173
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,160
customers and the engineers who are

174
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,080
responsible for fixing the code and

175
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,960
fixing the bug

176
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,039
they can at least understand what's

177
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,600
going on right

178
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,680
so net now let's talk about video pocs

179
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,000
so

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
first let me tell you that you should

181
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,479
try to avoid video pocs as much as

182
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,440
possible

183
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
um because videos can in some in some

184
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,639
cases

185
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,039
take longer to follow because triages

186
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:17,680
have to

187
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
continuously pause and then follow the

188
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
steps and while they are doing that it

189
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
becomes hard to get like an overview

190
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,639
of the bargain an overview of what's

191
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,759
happening right

192
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,280
so um try to avoid them but if you think

193
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,680
that

194
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
you have to put it and if it's extremely

195
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
necessary then you can do a lot to make

196
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
it very efficient

197
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
um and i'm gonna give you some tips on

198
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,199
how you can do that

199
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,080
so the first thing is do not write uh

200
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
steps on notepad on your screen

201
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,639
so try to include uh all the

202
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,479
reproduction steps in your original

203
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,199
report

204
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,400
uh so the video should not be

205
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,479
like we should not rely on the report to

206
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,479
uh follow your submission

207
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,759
um then make the video short and

208
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,639
to the point and you can also edit it in

209
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,199
if there's

210
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,000
too much unnecessary uh time recorded

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
for example sometimes

212
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
a page takes too long to load and when

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,039
you're intercepting

214
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,360
requests in burp you probably go through

215
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
10 requests before you reach the one

216
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
that you need to

217
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,479
so you can edit uh your video to remove

218
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,479
all of that and feel free to add music

219
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,120
as well

220
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,039
because when you add music it shows the

221
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,479
triager that you have taken that

222
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
bit of extra time to edit the video and

223
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,880
make it more efficient for us

224
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
another tip is uh make sure the video is

225
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,560
of good quality

226
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
uh it should have a good resolution it

227
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,400
should have a good bit rate so that any

228
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
text that's on the screen

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,199
is clearly visible to us and lastly the

230
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,240
best place to

231
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
upload your video is vimeo uh with a

232
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,800
password protection

233
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,879
so that the customers as well as the bug

234
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,960
bounty platforms have that assurance

235
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,440
that

236
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
no one has viewed the video because no

237
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,879
one can without knowing the password

238
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,199
and the smallest of details are very

239
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,560
important to mention

240
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,400
um and sometimes i have seen reports

241
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,720
being delayed uh for like one or two

242
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,280
days

243
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
because the researcher forgot to mention

244
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,520
a really tiny detail which was probably

245
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
insignificant

246
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,440
but which probably they thought it was

247
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,199
insignificant but it was actually quite

248
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,080
important

249
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,479
um and those details can be as small as

250
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,400
whether the user was authenticated or

251
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,599
not

252
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
and another thing uh you can do is put

253
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
in-line screenshots after each step and

254
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,879
this usually

255
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,599
uh happens when there's too much going

256
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,039
on on a single web page

257
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,360
and uh you put inline screenshots so we

258
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
can visualize it we can see it and then

259
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,440
we can easily just reproduce that

260
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,519
uh another thing you can do is provide

261
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,920
urls uh for direct navigation to the

262
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,480
endpoint

263
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,399
so again if we can't find something on

264
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,839
the ui um

265
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,240
or maybe if for some reason our layouts

266
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,080
are different if you provide a url we

267
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,680
can directly navigate to that endpoint

268
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,120
and reproduce the bug

269
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
right um another thing you can do is

270
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
mention the vulnerable http request

271
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,120
so usually if uh there is manipulation

272
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,279
of an http request involved in any

273
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,000
manner

274
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
then try to mention that http request

275
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
again for the same reason that if we

276
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,040
can't find something then we can

277
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,959
directly use that request and reproduce

278
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,360
the bug and there's no problem

279
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,000
and lastly be safe and don't forget to

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
redact any kind of sensitive information

281
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
in your report sensitive information as

282
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
i said before cookies

283
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,440
and um tokens or credentials

284
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,680
so all of that make sure it's redacted

285
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
and be safe

286
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,920
so let's go on to our next point and

287
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,839
this is a really interesting scenario as

288
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,399
well

289
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
um a lot of the times you'll probably

290
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
have more than

291
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,399
one user in your submission who's

292
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,760
involved in your submission

293
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
uh and this usually happens uh in the

294
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,440
case of access control bugs where you

295
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,000
have more than

296
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,800
two users involved so there are three

297
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
most important points that you should

298
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,519
always mention

299
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,440
uh in these kind of scenarios the first

300
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,640
thing you should mention is

301
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,320
what is the user's role in the

302
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
application so as you can see in this

303
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,959
example user a has an admin role and

304
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,360
user b has an analyst rule

305
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
the second point to mention is whether

306
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,399
uh

307
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,079
the second point to mention who is the

308
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,760
attacker and who is the victim

309
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,839
as you can see here user a is the victim

310
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,399
and user b is the attacker so

311
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,959
this again these two points make it

312
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,680
really

313
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,839
clear to us what is the impact and who

314
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,040
is attacking who and

315
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,560
how is it gonna work and lastly uh steps

316
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,040
for each of them should be separated

317
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
uh you can use markdown for that i know

318
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,959
most bug bounty platforms do support

319
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,839
markdown for

320
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,160
their reports so try to separate the

321
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
steps that user a needs to make from the

322
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,720
step

323
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
from the step that user b needs to do

324
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,320
because that will again reduce uh the

325
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
amount of confusion

326
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
and make it easy for us to reproduce

327
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,839
your bug

328
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
so now let's go on to the next section

329
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,519
which is

330
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,920
showing impact now once the triager

331
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,000
reproduces all your steps and ensures

332
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,320
that all the steps are valid and working

333
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,040
the next task is to actually demonstrate

334
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,800
an attack scenario

335
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,480
now the best way to uh

336
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
show the impact of your finding is to

337
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
write an attack scenario of how an

338
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
attacker could use the bug

339
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,040
to harm either the application or its

340
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,000
users

341
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
so the main question that you should

342
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,760
seek to answer while writing an attack

343
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,519
scenario is who would want to exploit

344
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,800
the bug and why

345
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,560
and another question is how does this

346
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,399
affect the app and its users

347
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,800
so an answer to that could be that if

348
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
the bug is exploited then it could lead

349
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
to a gdpr violation

350
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,760
so uh keep in mind that

351
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
an attack scenario is not always needed

352
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,880
uh for

353
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,600
especially for obviously valid bugs like

354
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
sql injection or xss

355
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,240
because after all uh triages are also

356
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
security engineers they do know

357
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
uh what impact these kind of bugs hold

358
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,279
but

359
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,440
uh writing an attack scenario helps you

360
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,560
think about the bug

361
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
that you're uh reporting in some cases

362
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,320
you might discover that

363
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
your bug is probably not that impactful

364
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,760
as you thought it was

365
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,519
or even the opposite that you discover

366
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,279
that it's more impactful

367
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,000
so let me give you some points that you

368
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,040
should think about

369
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,639
when you're writing an attack scenario

370
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,800
and the first is the starting position

371
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
of an attacker

372
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,360
so the starting position means what does

373
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,519
the attacker already have access to

374
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,920
and what will they get once they exploit

375
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120
the bug

376
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,480
so an example is a a user who has a

377
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,839
super admin role

378
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
will probably not be interested

379
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
in exploiting a user with a normal role

380
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,720
but vice versa

381
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
is more likely right so uh keep in mind

382
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
the starting position of the attacker

383
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
next is assumptions that you make about

384
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,800
the victim

385
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,959
so if you're assuming that the victim is

386
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,639
going to click on a link that's fine

387
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,480
but if you're assuming that the victim

388
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
is going to click on their link

389
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
enter their credentials download some

390
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,160
files execute that file on their system

391
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,000
that's a bit of a stretch

392
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,639
so you might want to look at that as

393
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,200
well

394
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,279
another thing is prerequisites for the

395
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,720
attacker

396
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,800
so does an attacker need physical access

397
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,839
to the device

398
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,720
uh what are the prerequisites that you

399
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
need over here

400
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,399
and another thing is prerequisites for

401
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,959
the application so does your bug depend

402
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,000
on some kind of

403
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,720
outdated browser version or a specific

404
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
version of the app does it require some

405
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,040
settings to be enabled or disabled

406
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
um so keep in mind that more assumptions

407
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
and more prerequisites means

408
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,440
lesser impact so

409
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,480
okay let's go on to an example attack

410
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
scenario so this is an example of what

411
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,639
an attack scenario could look like

412
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,120
so they are not exactly steps to

413
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,240
reproduce the bug

414
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,880
but it's rather just a quick overview of

415
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,639
how the bug can be exploited

416
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,199
uh in real life by an attacker so it

417
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,320
should

418
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,279
hope to include any challenges barriers

419
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,800
that an attacker will face while

420
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,040
exploiting it

421
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
so as you can see the first thing i've

422
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,560
mentioned is the admin of the workspace

423
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,240
invites a chat operator with a low

424
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
privileged role and a low privileged

425
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,839
role user is the attacker

426
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,519
so here it makes it very clear that the

427
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,880
starting position is

428
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,279
an uh the attacker is a low privileged

429
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,240
user and

430
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,240
they'll the attacker then gets access to

431
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
the uuids of all the other users of the

432
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,399
workspace so this immediately

433
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,279
shows me that this is going to be a

434
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,760
horizontal privilege escalation

435
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,279
and then since the attacker has all the

436
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,920
uuids he uses a crafted http request to

437
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,600
delete all of them from the workspace

438
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
right so it makes it very clear that the

439
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
attacker is a low privileged user he

440
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,040
gets a uu ids and deletes all of them

441
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,560
pretty clear right so that's all the

442
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,079
tips that i have for you

443
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,920
so let me give you a quick checklist

444
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,839
before we end this video and

445
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,440
you can use this checklist before you

446
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,959
sit down to write a report

447
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,639
so a checklist for writing good

448
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,240
reproduction steps the first thing you

449
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,199
should do is write

450
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,120
short and clear steps instead of long

451
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,560
paragraphs next

452
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,839
include a proof of concept really simple

453
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,560
uh next is uh video pocs which aren't

454
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,320
necessary but if you have to mention

455
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,040
them

456
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,800
but if you have to attach them then try

457
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,360
to make it as efficient as possible

458
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,160
mention any and all my new details

459
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,079
mention the steps and roles for all

460
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,600
users in case there are

461
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,720
two or three users involved and it goes

462
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
without saying that you should read your

463
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,480
finished

464
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,880
steps once again to ensure that there

465
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,320
are no errors

466
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
and this is a checklist for showing

467
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
impact so you can use this while writing

468
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
an attack scenario

469
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,839
first you should mention the starting

470
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,360
position of the attacker

471
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
then you should mention the assumptions

472
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
that you have made about the victim

473
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
and lastly mention any prerequisites

474
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,480
that are

475
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,560
required for an app or the attacker

476
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,839
so that was it i hope you found uh

477
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,519
i hope you found something useful from

478
