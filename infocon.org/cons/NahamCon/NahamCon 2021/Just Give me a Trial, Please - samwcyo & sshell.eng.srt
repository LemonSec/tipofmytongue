please where we discuss

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,920
hacking vendor applications and bug

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,759
bounty programs

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,599
i'm just going to give a brief

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,120
introduction to who we are

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,400
my handle is zlz also known as sam curry

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,600
and i'm kind of like a full-time bug

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,439
bounty hunter been doing it off and on

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,439
for probably like four years now

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,039
also running a security blog at

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,720
samegrade.net where i kind of talk about

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,039
like

16
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
bug bounty stories and applications

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
created research

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,760
uh yeah i'm justin reinhart or shell

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,239
i'm senior analyst at bishop fox i've

20
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:36,960
been

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,520
doing bug bunny off and on for uh for a

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,120
while now for a few years

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,960
and i do not run a security blog at

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,399
samquery.net

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,360
awesome so to kind of get right into it

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,079
um

27
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,199
in a lot of bug targets you run into a

28
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,640
really really awesome but a really

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,440
really overwhelming

30
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,640
asterisk.target.com and when you see

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,600
this it typically means

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,960
companies are like more willing to say

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,199
like hey whatever we have in scope you

34
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,160
know whatever we've made

35
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,720
like have at it you know try to break in

36
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,199
you know

37
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,560
we acknowledge that like we can get

38
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,760
hacked in like a billion different ways

39
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,560
so

40
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,720
you know have at it with the scope but a

41
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,159
lot of times what this actually looks

42
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,000
like when you start digging deeper is

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,880
a lot of vendor applications and scope

44
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,759
and you know you'll see

45
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,240
things like jira tableau xway and like a

46
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,159
billion different ones

47
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,840
yeah and it's just you know it's a

48
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,119
function of

49
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,280
you know apple specifically or yahoo or

50
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
any of these being some of the largest

51
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,159
companies in the world across multiple

52
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,720
continents multiple divisions

53
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
and all the different ways in which you

54
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,079
have to like organize and set up your

55
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,040
company

56
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,920
and all the tools you have to do that um

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,640
so

58
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,119
it's sometimes like if there's a vendor

59
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,399
application that exists

60
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,960
it's going to be on a yahoo or an apple

61
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,680
or a

62
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
thing right they have like a slash eight

63
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
so any any ip that starts with 17 dot

64
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,560
is it belongs to apple to give you an

65
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
idea of like the scope the massive scope

66
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,159
they have

67
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,520
yep and kind of like to go into like the

68
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,719
specifics of what like

69
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,479
looking at these uh application looks

70
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,759
from like a high level you know like

71
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,280
let's say you're doing like a sublister

72
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,639
like some

73
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,879
subfinder of like a particular you know

74
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,680
star dot

75
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
domain and you run into something which

76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,599
resolves to like a vendor

77
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
you know like hey am i allowed to hack

78
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,879
this a lot of times you know if it's

79
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,080
like a cloud hosted provider

80
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
the answer is no you know what i mean

81
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
but if the

82
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,959
domain resolves to like something that's

83
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,560
self-hosted you know for instance like

84
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,280
uh

85
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,920
companies like self-hosted like jira or

86
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,760
jam for jenkins or anything like that

87
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,120
it's you know a software that's running

88
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
on their network and they you have

89
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,120
permission

90
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
most of the time to like scan against it

91
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,920
but it does get pretty blurry which

92
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
we'll talk about

93
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,120
um and to kind of transition like those

94
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
particular technologies go go headshot

95
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
oh i was gonna say yeah it's uh it's one

96
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
of those things where

97
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,080
if you're if it's hosted on amazon it's

98
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,959
hard to

99
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,360
like that's kind of the gray area right

100
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,800
where it's

101
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
you know does the vendor you have to

102
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,920
look like does the vendor

103
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,440
like have other instances that are

104
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,599
hosted on like a similar

105
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,720
you know on similar ips also on amazon

106
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,120
or if you know if they don't use amazon

107
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,400
like defender it doesn't have it in

108
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
their instances hosted on amazon like

109
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,680
it's probably you know it doesn't belong

110
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
to them it probably comes to the belongs

111
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,560
to the company that you're

112
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
you're hacking on yep it's like super

113
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
weird as well because it's like you know

114
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
if uh if a company typically uses like

115
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
aws for all their deployments it's like

116
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,440
hey

117
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
you know this uh like vendor application

118
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,120
resolves like

119
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,360
a similar like aws ip it's like how do i

120
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
know you know what's what

121
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
and there's a lot of issues with those

122
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,840
like sort of communication channels and

123
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,519
trying to identify who owns what or you

124
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,720
know how to approach it

125
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,760
but most of the time it kind of looks

126
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,879
like this high level overview where it's

127
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,080
like you know you've got the vendor

128
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
product resolved to an ip

129
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,760
or at least for the ones that are like

130
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,120
in scope and you're able to hack you

131
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
know the ipo resolve to

132
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
some sort of ip that's owned by that

133
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,879
vendor via you know like you can confirm

134
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,599
be like asm lookups or whatever and

135
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,120
when that happens it typically means

136
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
that popping these applications would

137
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,360
like

138
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,879
give you full network access to these

139
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
vendors which is our

140
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
uh the target excuse me and uh therefore

141
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
it's like completely fair game if it's

142
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,920
in scope

143
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,519
and from here yeah you can pivot all you

144
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,280
know the kind of possibilities are

145
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,640
endless you know once you get inside a

146
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,319
network like that like pivoting and

147
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,519
moving around to wherever

148
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,358
of course at the discretion of the terms

149
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
of service for those programs but yeah

150
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,800
yeah and uh this meme right here is kind

151
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,080
of uh

152
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,960
i feel like explanatory of you know your

153
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,479
relationship with these vendors

154
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,440
um if you want to hack these vendors a

155
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,479
lot of times it's like

156
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,840
it's kind of where the trouble begins

157
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,199
it's like getting access to their

158
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,320
products right

159
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,479
if you see you know like hey you know

160
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,400
there's a solution for file service

161
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,520
management

162
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
and it's like something you pay like 30

163
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,680
000 a year for

164
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
ourselves as hackers like we're not

165
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,240
going to be able to like convince the

166
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,120
company to give us

167
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
trials unless they have like a pretty

168
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
serious security team or understand

169
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,919
at least like the basics of

170
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,400
vulnerabilities closure or bug bounty

171
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
and most of the time you get stonewalled

172
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
and it's like

173
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
you know i don't know what you mean by

174
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,600
do you want to try all the hack it

175
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
like do you have money probably not yeah

176
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,039
and

177
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,240
and in this end like you know we

178
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
like as hackers we don't we're not

179
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,160
making the company money and if anything

180
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
you know by like trying to get us set up

181
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
in an instance if they don't have

182
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,320
that sort of thing set up uh you know

183
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,520
we're taking away time that could be

184
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,440
used for actual sales or actual

185
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,520
you know development or any of that

186
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
stuff and if they don't

187
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,240
so like a lot of times when you'll see

188
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,680
something they'll be like oh like the

189
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
free trial requires you to talk to

190
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,360
someone for 30 minutes right it's like

191
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,199
you're you're essentially just taking up

192
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,400
their time with a sale that's never

193
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
going to convert they're not

194
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
going to want to talk to you you know

195
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,360
they're not going to be very helpful

196
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,280
yeah there's a reason uh a lot of these

197
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,400
contact forms have

198
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
at company.com for your registration you

199
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
can't use your gmail

200
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,199
which is really sad but at the same time

201
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,880
it makes sense right so i guess our job

202
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,639
as hackers is to kind of find a way

203
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,600
around that

204
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
and what most of the time it looks like

205
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,199
while hacking is

206
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
you know you do if do a sublist or

207
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,039
whatever and you see these like login

208
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,199
pages from the http screenshots

209
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,039
and it's just login pages like login

210
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,639
pages and login pages and login pages

211
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,160
it's like what do you do at that point

212
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,120
and how do you approach

213
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,600
it how do you fingerprint it it's weird

214
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
yeah yeah and i mean you only see these

215
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,600
if the company doesn't have like a

216
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,639
real strong sso or you know 2fa solution

217
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,080
if they have 2fa right like

218
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,280
a lot of this is it's kind of

219
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,440
meaningless if sso you won't even

220
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
you know make it to see most of these

221
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
applications

222
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,319
um but yeah that's but behind this is

223
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,800
where all the all the goodies lie

224
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
yep and that's kind of like our the

225
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
whole idea of a talk is the idea of like

226
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,319
how do you get past this point i mean

227
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,680
this is like the eternal problem or

228
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
if you're a problem like what what to do

229
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,840
as a buck bounty hunter when you see

230
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
these i think really there's only two

231
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,160
steps

232
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,680
um there's option a or option b and

233
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
option a for you know how to hack these

234
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,199
login pages is uh

235
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,360
you meditate for a thousand years in the

236
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
mountains and then you

237
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,720
come down as orange side and you're able

238
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,599
to

239
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,080
own static login pages with like crazy

240
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
exploits or there's option b

241
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
where we find a way to interface with

242
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,199
the company or

243
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,120
find a way to like view the source of

244
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
product and

245
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
kind of approach it in a more you know a

246
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
way in which as like an average hacker

247
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,080
would who's

248
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,440
probably not going to be able to pull

249
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,000
off crazy exploit change so

250
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,120
kind of transition to that what's what's

251
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,160
kind of annoying though is the idea like

252
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,319
if we do you know option b where we chat

253
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,759
up a company and be like hey you know

254
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,720
can i have a trial

255
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,759
you run into a sales guy who's like i

256
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,720
have no idea what you mean

257
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,039
nobody talking about but uh you're gonna

258
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,240
be receiving emails from them for the

259
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
next three years about like some

260
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,560
like talk seminar where they give you

261
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
like a live demo of a product on like

262
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,520
some screen sharing

263
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,639
320p resolution or whatever get like 50

264
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,440
emails a day

265
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,720
just from from this exact scenario where

266
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
i'm always you know invited to webinars

267
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,960
and

268
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
for a product that i would never use and

269
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
uh

270
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,840
you should make sure to use like a

271
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,400
throwaway email or at least uh

272
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,319
like a gmail alias so you can

273
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,120
automatically

274
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,599
it's it's wild the number of like the

275
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,639
amount of spam you get

276
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,240
but if we do want to take this approach

277
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
like kind of

278
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
the issues you run into right is we've

279
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
kind of talked about before and this is

280
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,479
more of a checklist it's like

281
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,840
hackers don't build other companies

282
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,599
we're not good sales targets um but the

283
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,120
second one is kind of interesting right

284
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
could you ask for permission to hack a

285
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
vendor right there's like a lot of

286
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,360
really interesting

287
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,200
you know like if i build a technology

288
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,559
which is a service for something like

289
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,200
let's say

290
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,000
uh something like http

291
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,360
like a load balancer solution for

292
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,479
instance right and i build this load

293
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
balancer and sense and it has like a

294
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,920
login to manage it

295
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,240
um but but what if that technology like

296
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,480
reaches back out to the vendor's

297
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,360
uh ipspace to like try to pull updates

298
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
right and let's say i spend all day you

299
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
know hacking this particular application

300
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,839
that's developed by company

301
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,200
but it's being ran on like the

302
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
bugbending network like

303
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
theoretically like i'm hacking upstream

304
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,880
to that vendor and that's just like

305
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
the that's probably most clear cut case

306
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,000
where it's like you have permission you

307
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,040
don't have permission but it can get

308
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
like really really blurry for like

309
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,760
who you're actually hacking right yeah

310
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,959
and a lot of the times

311
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,920
like establishing good like lines of

312
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,519
communications with these companies are

313
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,240
rough

314
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
either because they don't right if to

315
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,720
interface with the company you have to

316
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
first make it through like you know

317
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,279
sales

318
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,120
or um you know support or somewhere

319
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,360
like someone is it's kind of rare to be

320
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,399
able to just go to

321
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,720
like security at and get like a have a

322
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,839
good

323
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,120
kind of meaningful conversation right

324
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
off the bat um

325
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,600
and like there's not a lot of like

326
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
pipelines built out for how to do this

327
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,560
kind of thing so it's not it's not a

328
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
common occurrence for these companies

329
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,440
yep yeah it goes into the fact that a

330
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,000
lot of them

331
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,279
don't want to be you know they want to

332
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
be hacked right you don't want to have

333
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,640
to issue a cve

334
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,000
on your product you don't have to like

335
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,040
notify your your clients that you've

336
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,839
you know they need to update immediately

337
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,480
it's definitely like yeah super like as

338
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,160
hackers i feel like it's like oh

339
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
you know there's a company as a customer

340
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
it's like hey there's a company without

341
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,440
any cvs they must be really secure

342
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,120
but like as a hacker like oh there's a

343
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
company without any cbes

344
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
they must have like poor relationships

345
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,000
with the researchers right

346
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,279
like there being occurrences where it's

347
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,079
like i will like own an application

348
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,440
and i'll have to contact the vendor and

349
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,040
be like hey you know like i found the

350
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,000
vulnerability in this while

351
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
like hacking another company is there

352
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,519
any way i could have access like a demo

353
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,560
so i could like hack it a little bit

354
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,839
more as i feel like i could help the

355
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,560
vendor

356
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,920
and they're like yeah you know we'll see

357
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,480
about that and then they never do right

358
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,440
and they're it seems more often than not

359
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
they avoid cves more than anything

360
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
like they would rather you rather not

361
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,959
have to publish them

362
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,279
for obvious reasons right and it's kind

363
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,800
of like a weird relationship between

364
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,839
like you know

365
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,000
researcher vendor and also target right

366
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
there's like that weird triad where

367
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
you know typically the vendor only has a

368
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,279
communication channel

369
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,279
with the target and never really you

370
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,120
you're like the outside consultant party

371
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,399
and like they're

372
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,360
they don't want to have to deal with you

373
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,160
at all yeah we've been asked like

374
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
okay like thanks for reporting the

375
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,200
vulnerability but

376
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,079
like who like which client are you are

377
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:18,560
you

378
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,320
do you belong to like we don't we don't

379
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
speak with anyone but clients

380
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,760
so which client do you belong to yeah

381
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,040
and it's like i don't know but to get

382
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,160
into the particular case where we

383
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
explored for apple for instance um

384
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
we hacked this app called paga infinity

385
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,079
and uh

386
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,560
sadly we had planned to do this talk

387
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,519
where

388
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,040
we disclosed uh a bunch of

389
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,640
vulnerabilities we found on them but

390
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
they have a 90 days closure window so

391
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
we're able to give like a brief overview

392
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,839
of the methodology and how we approached

393
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,440
it and kind of let's get started there

394
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
where we'll discuss you know what

395
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,880
exactly went on

396
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,560
so to begin you know like the story is

397
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
like all of us are together hacking

398
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,959
apple

399
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,160
and we run into this like really

400
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,000
particular 403 page

401
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
and as shell said earlier um in a

402
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,519
conversation

403
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,519
the ugliest url i've ever seen um is

404
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,200
yeah it's uh it's all of the parameters

405
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
are encrypted

406
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,959
and which is something i've never seen

407
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,079
before in

408
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,160
in all my years of visiting websites uh

409
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,200
and yeah but luckily it had some of

410
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,959
these very easily

411
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,399
uh fingerprintable pieces and like

412
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,040
especially like this pr web slash app

413
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,320
and initially i thought this might have

414
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,880
been

415
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,639
something you know i didn't think it was

416
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,839
necessarily like a web technology

417
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,120
because when we first saw it we

418
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,240
saw this 403 error

419
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
and so with a little bit of digging i

420
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
found out that it belongs to

421
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
pagan infinity which if you

422
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,200
if we go and we look at like their

423
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
marketing information

424
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,480
uh there's a lot of words here yeah

425
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,839
uh i'm i'm not even

426
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,959
even after uh spending you know

427
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,000
like a week like thoroughly digging

428
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,320
through all different parts of you know

429
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,760
this application and

430
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,360
applications uh i don't think any of us

431
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,240
actually know what they do uh no still

432
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
no idea yeah i mean

433
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,360
this is like one of the technologies

434
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
where it's like uh not you know it's

435
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,959
just on salesforce whatsoever but it's

436
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,720
the most massive application you've ever

437
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,240
seen it's like an application for

438
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
applications it's like layers right but

439
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,000
pig infiniti was like somehow

440
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
more complicated right all of their

441
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,600
marketing was like you know machine

442
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,079
learning

443
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,680
like this this image right here if you

444
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,399
look a situational layer cake

445
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
like i don't we have no idea you know

446
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,519
when we when we think about it kind of

447
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,639
looks like this right

448
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,240
you've got the cake you've got the robot

449
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
you've got like the ai it's like what is

450
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
going on you really don't have any idea

451
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,279
and

452
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,079
luckily though we ran into you know with

453
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,639
actual

454
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,320
uh the way to actually figure out you

455
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
know like what a company does is like

456
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,519
find their developer documentation just

457
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,959
what we did

458
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,399
and we ran into this in this endpoint

459
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,399
which listed uh you know just feel like

460
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,680
google dorking and whatnot and looking

461
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,199
for particular things

462
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,760
it lists all these particular servlets

463
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,880
where

464
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,240
if you hit you know that url we

465
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,079
originally had four three and you append

466
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,360
them to them you can like browse the

467
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,839
different stuff and shelded a lot of

468
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,560
this

469
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
there was a lot of this uh shout out to

470
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,399
to corbin for get all the urls which

471
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,680
really helped

472
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,839
you find the uh right there

473
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,920
like the where peg is hosting their like

474
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,120
demo instances

475
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,480
or like hosting instances for customers

476
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,120
uh and you're able to look through urls

477
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,079
for

478
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,199
for that domain and find a lot of

479
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,320
different

480
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
uh very interesting looking urls and we

481
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,079
were able to kind of

482
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,320
piece together bits and pieces here and

483
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,279
there and

484
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,560
uh take paths you know from other

485
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,880
that belong to other sites and tack them

486
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,839
on the end and see okay this works this

487
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,000
doesn't

488
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
um until finally we you know

489
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
we defeated apple's laugh by using this

490
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,199
alias endpoint

491
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,800
yep and the way the way the aliasing

492
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,639
point kind of worked was like

493
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,639
before a particular pega version you

494
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,760
used to always have to have this like

495
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,279
slash pr servlet right and that would

496
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,959
let you access like the login page and

497
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,320
the index and stuff

498
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,680
but they said you know this is kind of

499
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,600
excessive so they removed it right

500
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
but what's interesting is that like

501
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,399
retroactively if you appended that it

502
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,000
would say oh you know this user is

503
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,839
trying to access it using pr servlet

504
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,199
let's just serve the

505
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,320
um old like index file and that's

506
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,839
exactly what happened and we're able to

507
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,759
defeat like apple's very explicit like

508
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,399
path waff

509
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,320
and then to this one uh we include this

510
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,160
this long slide with notes for testing

511
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,639
methodology on authenticated apps to

512
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
kind of like serve in the slide deck as

513
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,240
like here's like a list of you know kind

514
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,360
of a methodology follow

515
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,720
but i think for the actual talk we could

516
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,480
probably talk a lot um

517
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,639
about like the actual methodology we

518
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,399
followed for paga and to kind of start

519
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
um shell was kind of the initial finder

520
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,920
this he found like the initial recon the

521
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,560
domain

522
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,320
and how that works so it's kind of

523
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,680
transitioned into like how

524
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,959
how well we've been about figuring that

525
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,440
out yeah it was funny because

526
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
as soon as i found uh all right this

527
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,839
endpoint that we could hit

528
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,079
uh i threw it over to sam and i said hey

529
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,440
look this looks interesting

530
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
and uh you know before i did anything

531
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
else and as i was trying to

532
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
dig for endpoints he goes oh hey look

533
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,600
here's a here's an exercise here

534
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,800
[Music]

535
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,920
it's just one of those things where it's

536
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,160
just immediately after after finding it

537
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,639
just

538
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,399
kind of went to work right trying to

539
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,800
poke around at all the different places

540
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,519
um got to find out like what what can

541
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,000
you do

542
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
pre-auth like what does it look like um

543
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,880
and just kind of yeah figure out how

544
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
exactly it works is like the big first

545
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,120
thing and then

546
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,240
find out what functionality you

547
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,519
have pre-os yep and it's really it's

548
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,720
really weird cause like a lot of times i

549
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,079
feel like you know when people like kind

550
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,600
of assess web apps they're like

551
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,680
okay you know like here's this page and

552
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,040
here's like this input box where like

553
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
you can log in right and it's like okay

554
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,120
i have

555
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,759
this form and this form it's login you

556
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,359
know maybe throw in sql injection like

557
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
blind xss or whatever and it's like well

558
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,359
that's kind of all i can do but the

559
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,799
reality is like a lot of these apps like

560
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,160
their authentication models are like

561
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,799
really

562
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,720
wild sometimes like we've seen like a

563
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
lot of past research you know

564
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,799
um where you have like path issues where

565
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,400
it's like semicolon slash lets you

566
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,199
access like

567
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,919
the index or log in or bypass it and

568
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,599
it's like these custom web servers like

569
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,799
these custom like

570
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,760
huge apps where like you know there is

571
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,960
uh

572
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,480
on authenticated functionality but maybe

573
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
it's just not super clear at first right

574
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,679
and a great example of that would be

575
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,600
like um

576
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,120
applications where you can like log in

577
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
and generate like signed preview urls

578
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,160
right

579
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,360
so that way you can like share it

580
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,400
outside the organization without

581
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,360
authenticating

582
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,559
but what's interesting is like how do

583
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
you get that right like if i want to

584
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
find that as a hacker

585
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,480
it's like how do i go about doing that

586
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
like you're going to need

587
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
to pretty much like find a way to get

588
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
into that application

589
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,960
so we kind of like took a step back we

590
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
said well

591
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,400
in order to like pick infinity we're

592
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,320
going to need like either to find like a

593
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,880
like an apple employees login or like b

594
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,480
get a trial from the organization

595
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,600
or see what ended up actually working um

596
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,679
finding credentials to like another

597
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,280
instance of it that we could report

598
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,640
and you know kind of like log in and

599
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,320
passively check the urls

600
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,880
yeah yeah and from here i was saying

601
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,240
before where you take

602
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
uh like you try to like test

603
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
whatever endpoints you can find for

604
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,559
pre-auth

605
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,080
this really helps you take that to the

606
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
next level once you can actually log

607
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,919
in right and then you have you go from

608
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,440
having a very small list of just what

609
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
you can discover

610
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
kind of using ocean to now you have the

611
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,679
all or at least most of the application

612
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,160
uh

613
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,559
to sort of sift through and right click

614
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,760
on all the things go back and look at

615
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
your burp history

616
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,360
yep and it was kind of interesting like

617
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,799
almost immediately we searched you know

618
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,480
like i think the search we did was like

619
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,320
pr web slash app and then also like

620
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
authorization basic

621
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
and like immediately there was like a

622
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,440
you know for an

623
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
actual company that was affected by like

624
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,559
you know lead credentials

625
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,080
there's administrator login to their

626
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
page incense and like this is really

627
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,760
cool you know as you can see like we've

628
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,039
gone ahead and we've been able to access

629
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,720
like post off what this looks like

630
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,400
but of course like this isn't our system

631
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,480
so what we did was like we immediately

632
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,360
reached out to them

633
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,799
contact them and said hey you know we

634
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,240
were able to access this this can be

635
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,919
accessible by anybody you know send like

636
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,559
the

637
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,440
typical email and but also b you know

638
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,039
our goal obviously was to

639
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,559
hack apple but there's like a certain

640
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,080
kind of restriction on what we like can

641
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
and can't do here

642
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,400
as we're you know and someone else's

643
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
organization so to kind of transition to

644
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
that

645
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,559
we i guess before that actually what's

646
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,480
interesting is that

647
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,240
this is at the point where we pulled

648
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,320
endpoint and we're able to find a bunch

649
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
of really cool bugs

650
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,440
but sadly there's that 90 days closure

651
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,919
window and i think in the future if you

652
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,480
stay

653
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
tuned we'll be releasing some really

654
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
really cool bugs that you can definitely

655
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,679
add to your

656
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,039
automation process for pig infinity

657
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,679
but to kind of talk more about like the

658
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,280
ethics of like

659
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
where you are in that flow um i'll

660
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,640
transition to shell where you can kind

661
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
of give like an overview of

662
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,520
how about how to go about that yeah yeah

663
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,080
uh it's nice in this you know in this

664
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,360
instance that we were dropped into a

665
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
staging environment so we didn't

666
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,880
you know have to worry about anything

667
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,080
being you know

668
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,039
tested in prod uh you know like

669
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,159
massively tearing up

670
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,360
anyone's stuff uh

671
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,000
but basically the gist of this slide is

672
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,520
don't be a dick and keep track of what

673
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
you're doing

674
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,840
um right so like keeping track of what

675
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,039
you're doing is great

676
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,159
uh for both you and for the vendor and

677
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:46,640
for

678
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,919
you know the target um

679
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,360
because there's there's been times uh

680
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,159
in the past where i've hit an end point

681
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,919
and i have like also spring

682
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,960
and i have no idea what i hit

683
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,600
and i have no id but it somehow gave me

684
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,480
some other

685
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,919
functionality like enable some other

686
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,840
functionality and

687
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,400
uh i was like well i don't know what i

688
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,880
did

689
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,720
i just know that i did this series of

690
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,880
things and then i came back

691
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,600
so uh yeah being able to know what does

692
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,320
what really

693
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,360
really helps and uh

694
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,080
yeah you can clearly communicate to to

695
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,840
everyone what did it what exactly

696
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,039
where exactly the bug lies yep 100

697
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,360
it's like super like working with these

698
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,720
teams it's like very clear like a lot of

699
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,080
times like hey you know here's my ip

700
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
address here's what i did

701
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,000
um and most of the time like they're

702
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,120
very very understanding

703
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
like if you report like credentials and

704
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,240
you're not doing any like state changing

705
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,640
stuff

706
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,000
and all you're doing is like passively

707
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,840
logging urls in burp suite i feel like

708
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
that's totally acceptable you know

709
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,480
uh you could say you could argue like

710
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,080
perhaps like the idea that like using

711
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,280
the credentials in the first place to

712
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
like try to authenticate would be bad

713
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,840
you should report immediately but

714
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,200
i don't really agree with that as you

715
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,960
need the proof of concept but it gets

716
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,039
kind of complicated i guess but it's up

717
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,240
to you at the end of the day like what

718
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,200
lines you want to cross

719
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,400
if you feel like you've violated

720
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,240
something or company will be upset

721
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,360
then you know no like no thumbs up or

722
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,240
thumbs down it's

723
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,080
kind of like uh obviously don't do bad

724
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,000
things but it's your decision at the end

725
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,480
of the day

726
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,640
if you're acting in good faith uh

727
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
companies will generally

728
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,000
be okay with it and you know just don't

729
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,280
like that it comes back to like i said

730
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,240
at the end of the day just don't be a

731
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,120
dick

732
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,440
just you know right like realize that

733
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,720
anytime

734
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
you know a company receives an email

735
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,159
saying hey security thing like it's

736
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,679
stressful for

737
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,080
for everyone involved on the other end

738
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,960
uh yeah

739
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,039
and so yeah just you have to be like you

740
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,400
know aware that

741
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,039
not everyone's stoked to hear from you

742
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,960
yep 100

743
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,320
and kind of more information on like

744
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,000
notes for post off hacking on a pre-off

745
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,280
target which is really interesting like

746
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,880
the idea of you know

747
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
you have a target which has like post

748
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,400
off functionality

749
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,559
but you're not off yet like you kind of

750
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,240
have to like retroactively like put the

751
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
bits and pieces together to try to find

752
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,320
a way to you know like potentially

753
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,840
authenticate or like access

754
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,960
functionality that you're not supposed

755
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,080
to have access to

756
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,440
so like a lot a lot of what that looks

757
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,039
like is like hey you know like you

758
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,480
scrape out the urls that have cool

759
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,080
functionality and then you try to find

760
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,520
some way to hit them right

761
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,720
there's like a lot of like you know that

762
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,320
preview functionality uh how does

763
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
authentication work post off

764
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,159
is there any like can you generate

765
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,720
password reset you know links can you

766
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,120
try to add like guest users or enable

767
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
things and like what does that all look

768
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,480
like how does that all work

769
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,159
and lastly of course like oh go ahead

770
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,440
sorry i was going to say like

771
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,720
understanding all the pieces of the

772
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
system and how they fit together

773
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,480
like building a working mental model of

774
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,360
the application

775
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,919
and all the application different flows

776
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,400
in your

777
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,960
in your head uh really helps you get a

778
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
better picture of a target

779
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,120
yep 100 like there's been so many apps

780
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,799
where it's like uh

781
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,919
for instance like you're you're never

782
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,919
gonna find like any bugs like pre-auth

783
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,279
and you're kind of stressed out about it

784
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,559
but then you log in like post off and

785
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,159
it's like oh you know

786
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,919
here's like this directory that exists

787
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,000
and oh i can access this pre-auth

788
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
how does that work and maybe it's like

789
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,039
an xml api or something and all of a

790
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,799
sudden you have xxe pre-off then it's

791
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,760
just like boom

792
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,279
the app is gone um

793
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,440
and i think you know we may add more to

794
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,880
this slide deck a little bit but for the

795
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,320
talk today it's kind of just like that

796
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,760
general stuff i think we were running a

797
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,120
little bit low on time but

798
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,400
to kind of transition into the like

799
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,919
the end review here uh this

800
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,679
i think just overall the idea of like

801
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,919
hacking vendors is like very

802
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,640
it's interesting in a way of like you're

803
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,600
looking at an app which

804
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,880
probably affects like thousands of

805
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,400
people so it's like a really complicated

806
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,520
question of like

807
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,279
you know like a like who owns this

808
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
application and do i have permission to

809
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,320
test it and then like

810
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,679
if you do have permission to test it

811
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,360
like how do you go about reporting it

812
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,559
if you find a vulnerability and let's

813
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,159
say like something like atlassian uh

814
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,039
jira

815
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,039
you know the obvious answer would be hey

816
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,240
you know at leicester has a bug bounty

817
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,679
program report to them

818
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,120
but what happens if you're hacking like

819
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,679
apple and apple uses atlassian like

820
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,120
and obviously you know you're like a bug

821
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,880
hunter you're incentivized to

822
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,480
cash in your bug for the most money like

823
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,880
ethically obviously but uh

824
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
the idea is like it's it's very

825
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,480
complicated and in kind of our

826
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,600
experience it's just like a very

827
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,960
interesting problem

828
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,320
so to see kind of how to go about this

829
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
is just interesting to me and then

830
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,799
she'll leave any closing thoughts yeah

831
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,600
yeah i think it's

832
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
it's always neat when you have these

833
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,799
these bugs that

834
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,880
affect you know thousands and thousands

835
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
of different customers you know

836
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,840
from you know large software vendors

837
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,480
took

838
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,760
you know entire branches of multiple

839
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,600
different governments

840
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,880
um and yeah and like the flow like

841
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
there's a whole different topic you'd

842
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
writ that could be written on

843
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
trying to go about and find all of the

844
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,600
places where

845
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,240
these things are that you know have

846
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
disclosure

847
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,120
and you know have bug bunny programs

848
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,679
um and the best way to go about that

849
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,120
like sam said

850
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,000
but at the end of the day yeah just uh

851
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,840
it's all about having fun

852
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,799
yeah definitely uh definitely a really

853
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,919
interesting problem to see and i

854
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,440
i think like one big last thing is just

855
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,360
the idea of like if you see a vendor

856
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,320
application

857
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,720
i mean it's no different than a regular

858
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,320
application if it is like

859
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,480
in scope for testing right like never be

860
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,640
afraid of like oh you know like

861
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,480
cvs exist for this application it's like

862
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
a known you know thing

863
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
people try to hack this i'll avoid it

864
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,120
you know because it's just at the end of

865
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,400
the day as vulnerable as these other

866
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,919
applications so like why would you not

867
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,320
you know

868
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,559
