00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,000
uh thanks everyone for uh attending my

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,440
talk

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,760
thanks to nahamsec for putting on this

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,120
conference and inviting me to present

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,920
here

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,840
uh the title of my talk is bug bounty

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,759
platforms not just for bug hunting

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,160
anymore

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
so a little about myself i'm philip

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,560
wiley i'm an offensive cyber security

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,240
instructor at ine

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,080
i'm a pen tester and red team operator

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,160
with nine years of experience

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,880
i got my start as a sys admin moved into

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
network security application security

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,920
and then

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,120
into uh pen testing and i've been

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,399
in it and security for

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,640
a little over 23 years i'm an adjunct

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,719
instructor at dallas college

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,640
teaching ethical hacking this is where i

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
got my

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
teaching start i've been teaching there

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,000
for a little over three years

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
i started the phone school project which

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,600
is an education based

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
meetup started out teaching offensive

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,920
security techniques and moved into other

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,720
areas since there is the need for

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,479
that education for people trying to get

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,320
started into the field

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,760
i am a co-author of the book the

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,920
pentester blueprint and this is a book

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,640
on

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
starting as a career as an ethical

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,960
hacker and this is based on my classroom

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
room lecture that became a conference

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,600
talk that eventually became a book

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
i'm an advocate for hacking is not a

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
crime our mission there is we're trying

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,119
to get

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,720
the negative connotation away from

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
hacker that skill set is not only used

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
for bad it's used for a lot of good

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
i'm also an ambassador for an innocent

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
lives foundation

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,119
and kind of how i got involved in in bug

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,960
bounty

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,799
and got interested in the subject it was

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,799
just from you know

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,479
being a pen tester i followed people

53
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,240
like jason haddocks and

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,000
and he had some really good uh

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,159
techniques and things that that he uses

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,640
that

57
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,479
that i learned from so i became a fan of

58
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,840
his and just kind of started following

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,880
bug bounty

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,159
following bug crowd hacker one and then

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
uh bug bug crowd back in 2018 started

62
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,239
their ambassador

63
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,720
program and i've been telling my

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,160
students you know one of the ways to get

65
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,280
experience

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
as a pen tester is to do bug bounties

67
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
because you're getting to do

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,800
pen tests or you know vulnerability

69
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,080
assessments against production

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
environment so you'll be able to get the

71
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
experience

72
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
you know that you would in pen testing

73
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,800
that's very helpful in getting a job as

74
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,239
a pen tester

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,319
so i became an ambassador so i could

76
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,519
learn more about

77
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,080
bug bounty it was a way for me to mentor

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,040
and teach

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,599
help others get started in bug bounties

80
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,800
so that's kind of where

81
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
where i got started and actually was the

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
the first ever ambassador of the year

83
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,480
which was awarded in 2019

84
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,319
for my efforts at bug crowd

85
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,519
so that's what really got me interested

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,160
in space and i went on to learn

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,440
about you know some other really cool

88
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,080
people like nahom sec stoke

89
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,480
uh and some other really cool uh bug

90
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
hunters out there

91
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,159
so what is pen testing pen testing is

92
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,599
assessing security

93
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,120
from an adversarial perspective

94
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,080
so you're going in attacking like a like

95
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
a cyber criminal would do

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,360
because this is the one of the better

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
ways to test security if you're just

98
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,080
running a vulnerability scanner

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,159
there's things that you can miss so

100
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,360
there's a good chance that you're

101
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
going to miss some some vulnerabilities

102
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,640
there

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
and and things that are exploitable or

104
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
high risk you know if you're able to

105
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,599
exploit

106
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,400
a certain level of access to a system

107
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
you know if you're on

108
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,159
as a low-level user can you elevate your

109
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,760
privileges can you do lateral movement

110
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,959
so you really don't know that

111
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,080
unless you test it the same way a

112
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,360
malicious hacker

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,480
or cyber criminal would do

114
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,159
and so this is assessing security from

115
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,920
the adversarial perspective

116
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,879
and you're paid per project so emphasize

117
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,560
that because we're going to talk about

118
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
the differences between

119
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,840
the two of pentesting and bug bounding

120
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,000
so these pen testing skills or offensive

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
security skills are helpful in other

122
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,560
areas

123
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,400
like application security this is what

124
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,640
got me interested in pen testing

125
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,560
sock analysts so sock analysts are

126
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
monitoring for malicious traffic so be

127
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
able to detect

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
malicious traffic understanding the

129
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,279
different type of attacks will make you

130
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
better as a sock analyst

131
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,040
digital forensics and instant response

132
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
investigating breaches

133
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
investigating malicious traffic or

134
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
activity is going to make you a better

135
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,000
investigator

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,240
and security operations so your firewall

137
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,759
administrators

138
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,880
uh your seam administrators

139
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
ips all those you know be able to

140
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,440
understand that malicious traffic

141
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,120
that that hacker mindset is going to

142
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
make you a better

143
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,360
better defender so what is bug bounty

144
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,479
you know there is there are some

145
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,880
similarities and that's really why

146
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,400
i did this talk today to kind of show

147
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
you how you could use these skills

148
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
to become a pen tester if that's where

149
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,440
you decide to go with your career

150
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,880
so same as pen testing this is assessing

151
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,520
security from an adversarial perspective

152
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,759
this time you're paid per vulnerability

153
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,160
instead of per project

154
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,960
and this is also recur referred to as

155
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,880
crowd source so sometimes you hear

156
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,039
bug crowds or bug bounties referred to

157
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,759
as crowd source pen testing

158
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,120
so this means you've got like a number

159
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
of people not just one person performing

160
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,759
a test

161
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,199
so this could be you know just

162
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,560
theoretically this could be anywhere

163
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
from in the tens to the hundreds of

164
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,000
people

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,280
testing an app and so the strength of

166
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,919
that

167
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,759
is that you're getting you know a lot

168
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,280
more opinions a lot more

169
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,800
hours when you figure out the amount of

170
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
hours of work that someone's putting in

171
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,199
the test

172
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,800
compared to an individual that's a lot

173
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,479
more a lot more

174
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,120
human hours put in and so a lot more

175
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,039
chance to find vulnerabilities

176
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,720
and sometimes you know this is a good

177
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,960
add-on along with a pen test too

178
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,520
and we'll describe something here in

179
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
these next few slides on how

180
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,720
how that's kind of done by some of these

181
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,400
bug bounty companies

182
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
so there are some similarities and

183
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,880
differences between these two

184
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,039
so uh pen testing compared to bug bounty

185
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,400
so as we mentioned before pen testing is

186
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
paid per project

187
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
while bug bounties are paid per bug or

188
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,240
vulnerability

189
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
so you have individual pen testers

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,080
sometimes a team could be

191
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
typically a small team if there is a

192
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,000
team compared to crowdsource security

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
assessments using multiple uh bug

194
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,759
hunters also known as security

195
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
researchers so this could be any number

196
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
of people this could be

197
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,199
a small group to you know just having

198
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,720
some experience with some live hacking

199
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
events that bug crowd puts on their bug

200
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,680
bashes

201
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,880
you know man they probably had i've

202
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,479
close to maybe 100 people show up for

203
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,560
these bug bounties and you know normally

204
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,720
a bug bounty could have you know

205
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,639
possibly a thousand people working on it

206
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,360
so

207
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,039
the opportunity to find bugs or more and

208
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,280
plus if you get to work in one's

209
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
live hacking events like hackerone does

210
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,479
or bug crowd

211
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,759
you're able to work with other people

212
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,360
and learn so there's good opportunities

213
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,479
there

214
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,840
and i think a lot you know it gives you

215
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
the opportunity to you know some people

216
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,599
you know that are experienced out there

217
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,919
are willing to help with help and uh

218
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,160
and teach you along the way so these are

219
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,440
these are good opportunities

220
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
and so pin testing experience from bug

221
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
bounty and so one of the things i want

222
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
to share here too as far as getting this

223
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,680
experience how helpful this is you know

224
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
one of the things i share with my

225
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,639
students people i mentor

226
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,120
people asking for advice you know they

227
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,080
ask how

228
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
you know you know to get experience in

229
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,639
bug bounties i mean get experience in

230
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,520
pen testing

231
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,879
and the thing i share is uh you know

232
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
how you can use this this this bug

233
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,319
bounty experience

234
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,560
and that is helpful because i was

235
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
talking to a hiring manager

236
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,720
of a pen testing firm over the summer

237
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,759
last year

238
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,360
and he was telling me how it was easier

239
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,120
to find web app pen testers

240
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,440
because the bug bounty there's you know

241
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
there's bug bounties that

242
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
that are iot related could be hardware

243
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
related

244
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
car hacking type of bug bounties but

245
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,199
more commonly there's a lot of web app

246
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,400
pen testing

247
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
or web application bug bounties so this

248
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,759
gives you experience

249
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,440
so the kind of was really good to hear

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
it validated what i believe said you

251
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,680
know

252
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,120
give me a little bit of evidence that

253
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
this is actually the case you know you

254
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,640
in theory it makes sense that you're

255
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,919
going you're getting experience would be

256
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,839
helpful but when you hear from someone

257
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,839
that's hiring pen testers that's really

258
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,679
really good to hear

259
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,599
especially you know to be able to share

260
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,039
with people trying to get into it to let

261
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,000
them know this is the

262
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,640
this is what you do so pen testing

263
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,480
through bug bounty platforms

264
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
so this is an option here uh like bug

265
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
crowd and hacker one

266
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
they also perform pen tests and so

267
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
while i was an ambassador for for bug

268
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
crowd i actually did one of their next

269
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,360
gen pen test one their very first ones

270
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
and their next gen pen test was

271
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,480
basically a pen test

272
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,200
along with a bug bounty going along

273
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,279
simultaneously

274
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,760
so you know you have a researcher would

275
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
go through perform a pen test while

276
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,160
you have other people participating in

277
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,000
that bug bounty

278
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
and so to get invited to these you know

279
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,640
like a bug crowd you would sign up let

280
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
them see your skills

281
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
and you get the opportunity to do that

282
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,320
but a lot of this is going to take you

283
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
know as you get experience so if you're

284
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,880
someone coming in

285
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,640
to one of these bug bounty platforms you

286
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,160
don't have the pentax pen testing

287
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
experience yet

288
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
as you get experience you're finding

289
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
bugs showing success

290
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
and putting time on the platform then

291
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,480
you'll get invited to do things like

292
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,200
these

293
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,000
these penetration tests and so there's

294
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
you know that's a good way

295
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
to learn and you and with the doing the

296
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,480
way i know

297
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,959
the way bug crowd does it you're you're

298
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,720
getting paid for bugs as well

299
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
as for the pen test so it's not only

300
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,399
getting paid per vulnerability it's also

301
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,120
getting

302
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,399
paid to perform the pen test

303
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,640
and so there's some other companies that

304
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,440
that they're

305
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
crowdsourced pen testing similar to bug

306
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,720
bounty

307
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,959
and uh like synac they still have the

308
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,760
bug bounty

309
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
piece to it where people are looking for

310
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,279
individual bug bug bounties

311
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,440
but there's also two people are

312
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
performing pentest then cobalt

313
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
they started out as a pentest company

314
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,200
but they went to pen testing as a

315
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,160
service

316
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,839
model so this means that you know

317
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,680
companies are paying them to do pen

318
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,959
tests and what happens is the

319
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,160
researchers or their

320
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
their penetration testers perform a pen

321
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,440
test so you're getting paid for an

322
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
individual pen test

323
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,360
and then in synack you know you're

324
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,560
performing pen tests

325
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,120
with them but you know the interesting

326
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
thing between like bug bounty starting

327
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,399
out with bug bounty it's a little bit

328
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,200
easier to get in

329
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,240
you apply you start participating

330
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,880
but with these platforms like cobalt and

331
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,000
synac

332
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
you have to go through an interview

333
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
process there's some technical

334
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
challenges that

335
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
there may be like a vulnerable vm or a

336
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
ctf type challenge that you have to be

337
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,279
successful in

338
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,600
and and get past the interview to to be

339
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,760
able to join

340
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,880
so those are some options there

341
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,560
to kind of expand past bug bounty or if

342
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,600
you have a little bit of bug guy

343
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,320
experience and

344
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
that's a way to pivot more into the pen

345
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,360
testing side of things

346
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,440
and so one thing is you know if you get

347
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,120
in and you don't make it first try on

348
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,000
these interviews with that

349
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,440
keep practicing and you'll get that

350
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
experience and you'll get to move on

351
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,720
and as you get that experience on those

352
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,399
other platforms you can

353
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,320
have the opportunity to do pen tests

354
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720
with them

355
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,240
and so how does the bug bounty

356
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,000
experience help so

357
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,720
how the bug bounty experience helps out

358
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
is when you're performing a pen test

359
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
you're learning

360
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,760
you know how to do the steps of a pen

361
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,959
test you're learning how to test for

362
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,480
vulnerabilities and a really good place

363
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,959
to

364
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,160
to look for those is is the os top ten

365
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
learn the os top ten because this is

366
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
going to help you during interviews

367
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,200
if you're interviewing for a pen test

368
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
job whether it's web application

369
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,200
pen testing or not those are the

370
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,639
vulnerabilities you typically get asked

371
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,440
questions about

372
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,519
so know the different types of sql

373
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,959
injection the different types of

374
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,800
cross-site scripting

375
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,839
how to remediate those vulnerabilities

376
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
and so as you read the wasp top 10 you

377
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,279
understand those vulnerabilities a

378
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,720
little bit more and really

379
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,040
learn to realize the risk so not only

380
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,399
you find these vulnerabilities

381
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,959
it's important to understand the risks

382
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,800
and so that way you can explain

383
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,880
how to remediate and understand the

384
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,160
severity so when you're working with

385
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,519
someone on a pen test or you're doing a

386
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,360
bug bounty you're able to share

387
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,959
you know this is why this is a risk and

388
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,519
bill explain that

389
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,760
so going through that process is gonna

390
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,200
help you on the interviews as well as

391
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,120
the technical skills that you're gaining

392
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,240
so when you go into you know to

393
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,160
interview for a pen testing job or if

394
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,600
you're trying to interview

395
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,959
to get on with synack or cobalt

396
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,480
you're able to perform these technical

397
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,120
challenges these ctf or vulnerable vm

398
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
vms they give you or vulnerable

399
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
environments that you perform pentest

400
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,639
against

401
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,160
you're able to perform those based on

402
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,519
what you've learned during your

403
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
technical interviews you're

404
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,360
able to describe how you use different

405
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,040
methodologies

406
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
and how you look for different types of

407
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,720
vulnerabilities

408
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,079
and explain how to use the different

409
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,519
tools so these are the same things

410
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,720
they're going to ask you on a technical

411
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,399
interview so you're getting

412
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,040
that experience and to go back to like

413
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,959
the bug bounty platforms

414
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,600
and like cobalt and synac you can get in

415
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,240
those platforms a little less experience

416
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,560
and so they're you know if you're going

417
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
to try for like

418
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,600
you know some of these really well-known

419
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,519
uh pen testing firms

420
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,639
you're going to need they're usually

421
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,560
going to require a certain amount of

422
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,360
experience

423
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,240
sometimes certifications and so it's a

424
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,560
little

425
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,839
easier to get into some of these

426
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,320
platforms not saying to do the work is

427
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,959
easy

428
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,160
but they're a little more friendlier

429
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,920
because they you know the crowdsource

430
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,040
model requires

431
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
a lot of researchers so they're going

432
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,839
they're constantly want to bring people

433
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,480
on

434
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,519
you know like uh hacker one has some

435
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:03,839
great

436
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,040
learning content they're hacker 101

437
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
also like bug crowd university they're

438
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
wanting to educate people to get them on

439
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,160
the platforms

440
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,959
so they're gonna be more friendly

441
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,639
towards bringing people on compared to

442
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,760
these other pin testing companies

443
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,839
they're going to be more particular and

444
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,880
it's going to be a little more difficult

445
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,240
to get in

446
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
so this is a good way to get experience

447
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
so you know getting the experience doing

448
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
the interview

449
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,720
learning the different tools to be able

450
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,560
to perform the pen test so this is

451
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,279
what what's needed to get in so this is

452
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,800
one of the reasons i recommend

453
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,040
doing bug bounties also things like hack

454
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,120
the box try hack me

455
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
are good ways to get experience doing

456
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,760
ctfs so all this stuff helps as you gain

457
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,120
the experience

458
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,320
through these different things is to

459
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,839
help you on your path to becoming a pen

460
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,120
tester

461
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,680
and if you enjoy you know doing uh bug

462
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,480
bounties

463
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,079
then you can still do both i know a lot

464
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,639
of people that are pen testers that

465
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,279
that do bug bounty part time and so

466
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,639
that's a possibility you can make some

467
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,000
extra money that and you're also

468
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,279
sharpening your skills

469
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,720
so if you're working somewhere as a pen

470
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,160
tester and you're not getting much web

471
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,760
app pen testing experience

472
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,959
then if you're doing bug bounty you're

473
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,480
going to get more experience maybe

474
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
you'll get some iot experience expanded

475
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,360
to some other areas

476
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
so one of the things about being a pen

477
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,880
tester and or

478
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
security researcher or bug hunter is

479
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
you're constantly having to learn

480
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,839
and so this gives you a way to try new

481
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,800
things

482
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,279
and get that experience so thank you for

483
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,120
attending my talk

484
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,000
