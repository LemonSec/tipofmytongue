00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,639
hi everyone um thanks for attending my

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,000
talk for naham khan

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,080
and putting your mind to it bug bounties

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,359
for 12 months with me

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,840
z shawnee i'm very honored to be able to

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
speak at this conference and i'm also

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,880
honored to be able to sponsor it

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,120
as bugbountyhunter.com if you haven't

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,840
heard of it definitely check us out at

10
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,880
bugbountyhunter.com

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,359
so what is my talk gonna be about well

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,880
i'm a strong believer that if you put

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,560
your mind to something amazing things

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,000
can happen

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so this talk will be aimed at

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,439
experienced and in

17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,880
inexperienced people because i'm

18
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,479
basically going to set you a task at the

19
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,239
end of this for the next 12 months for

20
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,280
you to go out

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,200
and hopefully you'll find some cool bugs

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,160
and earn some bounties potentially

23
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,320
because i'm hopefully going to ease some

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
of your concerns and show you that with

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,280
time effort

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,000
and patience the sky really is the limit

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,840
especially with bug mountain is because

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,440
you can sit at the comfort of your own

29
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,840
home and hack on so many

30
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
massive companies with so much in scope

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
and it honestly will keep you busy for a

32
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,000
long

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,440
time so for those of you who do not know

34
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,079
who i am

35
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,040
my name is z shawno my real name is sean

36
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
i'm a self-taught developer

37
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,520
web application hacker and mentor i

38
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,760
first started out developing websites

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,960
aged 11 12 13 etc

40
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
and eventually learned how to hack and

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,000
yeah

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
now i do mentoring on

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,439
bugbountyhunter.com which i mentioned

44
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,400
earlier

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
but the site is aimed at teaching people

46
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
how to identify vulnerabilities and web

47
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,159
applications but also applying this

48
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,920
knowledge on bug mountain programs

49
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,799
so in the membership section once users

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,079
find enough bugs

51
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,680
on the vulnerable web application that i

52
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,600
set up they can join what is called hack

53
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,320
events

54
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,040
and i will basically hold their hand and

55
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,479
show them how to

56
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,880
apply my methodology and identify

57
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,759
vulnerabilities

58
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,280
on public bug bounty programs

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,119
i'm a big fan of just targeting one

60
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,280
program and literally just going as deep

61
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
as possible finding out what what works

62
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,600
how it works etc and i actually managed

63
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,439
to achieve rank two on bug crowd when i

64
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
first started out in bug mounties

65
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,680
um i targeted literally one program it

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
took me eight nine months literally just

67
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,920
focusing

68
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,318
understanding how things work and yeah

69
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,119
my profile

70
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,680
is now deleted on bug crowd but we won't

71
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,879
get into that

72
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,879
so bug money for 12 months

73
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,040
think about it and i will get into

74
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
that bug bounties isn't all plain

75
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,160
sailing it's not

76
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,440
all dominant fun and games amazing there

77
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
are

78
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
some whole loop not loop sorry there are

79
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
some like holes as such and

80
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
concerns and problems but we'll get into

81
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
this so

82
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
for the moment though just sit back and

83
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
think about this right companies around

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,920
the globe will invite hackers like me

85
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,560
and you to legally poke at their systems

86
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,400
legally you cannot get in trouble they

87
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,319
have most of them have safe harbors and

88
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,200
they will say hey

89
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,000
you can hack and if you find anything

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
tell us and we'll pay you

91
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
literally you sit at the comfort of your

92
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,680
own home hacking at your own pace

93
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,080
and you can get paid big money for it so

94
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,120
as a hacker

95
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
bog bounties has enabled the internet to

96
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
become your oyster

97
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,760
so literally as it says there let's hack

98
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,319
the planet

99
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
so my first tip for people wanting to

100
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
succeed in bug mounties now like i say

101
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,920
this is aimed at experience and

102
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,040
inexperienced people

103
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,480
um if you don't understand like too much

104
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,840
about web application hacking and

105
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,280
vulnerabilities then of course

106
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,000
this talk might not be obvious used to

107
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,400
just

108
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,000
at the moment go away and learn from how

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,480
to find

110
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,000
web application vulnerabilities practice

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
against some challenges

112
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,440
um and things like that and understand

113
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
what xss is crosstalk quest forgery open

114
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,319
uri

115
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,519
open url redirects idols and things like

116
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,640
that because

117
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,360
you need to understand the common

118
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,120
vulnerabilities and what they are

119
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,879
why they actually exist so for example

120
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,680
with xss you chuck it some input and it

121
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
reflects it back as html you have your

122
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,560
xss

123
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
whereas with idol you're looking for

124
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,959
integer values or some sort of identify

125
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,239
in the request

126
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,159
um and if you change it to something

127
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,840
else you're able to either view or

128
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
modify or do something to someone else's

129
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,480
data

130
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,080
right so a lot of people will think

131
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,560
or they're told sorry or they advised

132
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
look for just one bug type

133
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,798
learn all about xss and just go look for

134
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
xss

135
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,320
i don't believe in my opinion that's a

136
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,520
good approach because you're going to

137
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,000
miss

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,960
so many bugs and healthy features and

139
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,120
things like that so understanding how it

140
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,960
works and then you know what to look for

141
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
so example a login flow when you're

142
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
logging into a website or you're

143
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,240
registering

144
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,960
look for o wolf sso login tokens and

145
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
things like that look for

146
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
look for what happens but not only that

147
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,240
once you're signed in let's say for

148
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
example you sign into google.com

149
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
go find a subdomain that you can sign in

150
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,919
and see when you press sign in well

151
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,360
first of all are you already signed in

152
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
if you're not if there is there a sign

153
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,320
in button that when you press sign

154
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,479
in maybe it doesn't really ask you for

155
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,080
your username and password and there's

156
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,880
some sort of

157
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,360
token exchange happen and it just logs

158
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,880
you in based on this a token do i mean

159
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,520
that token

160
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
identifies who you are that's for user

161
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
experience they don't want you to have

162
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
to re-log into every single website

163
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,759
owned by google

164
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,120
they want you to be able to visit their

165
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,960
website and you're in your account

166
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,160
you're if you're logged into google

167
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
you'd want to be able to log

168
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,000
in all their services right that's then

169
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
when you can use a harmless

170
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
open url redirect um to potentially leak

171
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,479
that for example

172
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,199
edit in your profile why would you think

173
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,720
to look for an idol and edit your

174
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,600
profile well

175
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
think go look at it in your profile on

176
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
some websites you'll see

177
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
your account id sent in the request

178
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,639
maybe it's sent in the url

179
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
maybe you a center some post data

180
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,560
pretentious actually sent us a header

181
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,039
if it's a mobile app sometimes and

182
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,240
believe it or not there was a bug

183
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
disclosed on a heavily tested website on

184
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
yahoo believe it or not

185
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
where they it was naffy where they found

186
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
an idol simply via the cookie value i

187
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,199
mean it's on one of their slides from

188
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,199
years and years ago

189
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,520
crosstalk forgery it's an easy account

190
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,120
takeover and not only that but i always

191
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
recommend people

192
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
go test features that should be the most

193
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,840
secure so

194
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
updating your account information on for

195
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
example google

196
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,960
should be secure right there should be

197
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,240
crosstalk request 4g token they

198
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,199
shouldn't be allowing

199
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,360
anyone to update anyone's information

200
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,639
when they visit the tag

201
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,639
the attackers website and things like

202
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,400
that so

203
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
see how how does it work what how are

204
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,840
they validating

205
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
and where their requests came from and

206
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
things like that and stored xss because

207
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,440
i mentioned earlier anytime you can

208
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
input information and it's reflected

209
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,680
back

210
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,280
you want to be testing for xss and

211
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
server side template injection and

212
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,319
things like that anytime it's reflected

213
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,280
back

214
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,400
you chuck that at it and see what

215
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
happens developer tools

216
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,720
now go on to google right now during the

217
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,759
talk and type in

218
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
hackerone webhook ssrf

219
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,199
you'll find some disclosed reports

220
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,560
you'll find some blog posts and things

221
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,599
like that

222
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,319
now again understand the features and

223
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,840
what to look for so when you visit for

224
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
example developer.paypal.com

225
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,840
and you can see that you can test

226
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,599
instant payment notifications and web

227
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,400
hooks

228
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
you then have to think from a hacker

229
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
perspective and

230
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
add in a bit of a developer thought

231
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
right okay

232
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
so we've got a feature here that is

233
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,039
intended to send a request to the

234
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,080
website that i

235
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,960
input and it's going to query it and

236
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,440
pull

237
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,560
the metadata and display it to me

238
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
so you then as a hacker need to think

239
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
well okay what's this developer done to

240
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,479
stop me from querying for

241
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,479
um internal services some metadata

242
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,240
things and etc i mean

243
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
and then down the rabbit hole you go

244
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,160
maybe they've just simply blacklisted

245
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
saying no you're not allowed to look for

246
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,400
localhost if localhost is inputted here

247
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,599
block it

248
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,280
but maybe some different encoding will

249
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,120
bypass it maybe that literally is just a

250
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,319
hard coded fish

251
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,960
i mean string to look for redirects and

252
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
things like that

253
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
and that's because these developer tools

254
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,240
which are made for developers for

255
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,639
me for users to use they're purposely

256
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
coded

257
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,360
with like the intention of like it's a

258
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,639
server-side request

259
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,160
because they're sending the intention of

260
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,759
that feature is to send a request to

261
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,479
this website

262
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,160
pull the information but then you add

263
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
the hacker mindset and you start poking

264
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
around

265
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
um and the same with mobile apps go

266
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,120
check and see updating your information

267
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,440
like literally run burp now on your

268
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
phone open a few apps that you've got

269
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
installed obviously you have the https

270
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,000
cert installed etc of ssl pinion

271
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,599
and just update your information you'll

272
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,520
see your id

273
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,599
like using a lot of apps to identify

274
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,520
which account to update

275
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,879
now with that in mind most features

276
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
on websites work the same they take user

277
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,880
input they handle it like they do

278
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,599
something with it

279
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,320
and then they maybe reflect it now

280
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,839
that's why you'll look at some hunters

281
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,760
and say how can you just find so many

282
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,599
bugs on this website it's quite tough

283
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,800
and that's because with years of

284
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
experience and something that hopefully

285
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,920
you over the next 12 months you're going

286
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,720
to pick up

287
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,320
you'll discover that like i say websites

288
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
work the same and you'll be able to

289
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,240
look at our website and you just know

290
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
you just see it they see a certain

291
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,800
request you

292
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
see a certain parameter you see

293
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,320
something certain reflected et cetera

294
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
and you just know

295
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,160
because pretty much things work the same

296
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,640
obviously

297
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
i mean his variety of how requests are

298
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,920
sent json requests

299
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,240
etc but again that then opens up even

300
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,000
more things to test for because if

301
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,560
every single request is sending json

302
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,279
data

303
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,440
we'll change the content type to

304
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,200
application xml and see if they're

305
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,160
passing xml

306
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,839
because maybe they are and you can get

307
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,440
xxe whereas

308
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
if you didn't see that you potentially

309
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,880
wouldn't think to try that would you

310
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
join me if it was just sending it as a

311
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,319
normal post um i seen a drink

312
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,880
so yeah hopefully people understand that

313
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,519
so

314
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,120
it's not a case of right i'm just gonna

315
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
look for xss all over google

316
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,480
it's a case of right i'm gonna

317
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,160
understand what this

318
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,720
feature is in front of me what can i do

319
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,360
with it

320
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,399
um but yeah

321
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,440
second tip don't spray and pray

322
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,959
find the right way now i'm not a fan

323
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,519
of just spraying payloads everywhere and

324
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,640
hoping for the best

325
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,880
using the same payloads i'm not even a

326
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,959
fan really of polygots because

327
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,880
when you're chucking quite a lot at it

328
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
and a certain part of that payload

329
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
might trigger some sort of waffle filter

330
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,760
and then it all might not go through and

331
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,600
yeah so like this is actually a bug on

332
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
parker believe it or not and if you

333
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,959
visit bugbountyhunter.com

334
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,680
there is actually a tutorial um like my

335
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,279
flow of looking for xss

336
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,079
on there and it says there start

337
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,040
harmless first

338
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
now like i say this bug is on barca

339
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,959
where if you chuck script alert

340
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,480
it doesn't work whereas if you give it a

341
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,360
h2

342
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,160
or some harmless html you'll see it's

343
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,959
reflected

344
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,079
so then then you start going down the

345
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,519
rabbit hole okay well how can i make

346
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,600
this malicious what is actually going on

347
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,000
and

348
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,680
down the rabbit hole of testing you go

349
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,440
but you've started harmless first

350
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,800
you've started off with something that's

351
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
probably more likely gonna reflect back

352
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,360
to you

353
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,959
and you can confirm is this vulnerable

354
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,200
to xss what are they actually reflecting

355
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,079
and very easily you can quickly test for

356
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,079
xss on the fly

357
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,720
um an example of this is a heavily

358
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
tested website i was literally just

359
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,399
giving it image source equals x on error

360
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,279
alert

361
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,920
didn't work anywhere um and then i was

362
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,959
trying

363
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,519
to bypass a random filter on there like

364
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,040
with xss where it was reflected and i

365
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,959
needed a single apostrophe

366
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,360
um and then i re when i tried it i saw

367
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,519
that it actually reflected my html like

368
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,079
it's valid html and i was like huh

369
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,720
so i went and revisited a bunch of xss

370
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
and discovered that

371
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
anytime i added a single apostrophe to

372
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,480
any of the xss payloads it worked

373
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
this is what i can assume is some

374
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
anti-sql

375
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
injection code one on their website or

376
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,680
whatever but yeah

377
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,360
that was a a weird bypass in my opinion

378
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,279
but don't just chuck the script alert

379
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,200
check various payloads at it chug verse

380
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,399
characters out to see

381
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,320
how things are being handled and what is

382
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,600
being reflected

383
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,880
and then you can work your way from

384
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,920
there the same applies for everything in

385
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,880
my opinion

386
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
um so if sql injection don't just chuck

387
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,959
it a random like a payload that you

388
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,720
found on the internet to

389
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
get the database table versions or

390
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,639
anything like that

391
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,240
because they might be filtering this

392
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
waff etc

393
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,519
chuck just like a single apostrophe or

394
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,120
some random characters that are gonna

395
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,279
break the sql if it's vulnerable to sql

396
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,720
injection if you're giving it a single

397
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,160
apostrophe and some other random

398
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,800
characters

399
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,839
like read up on sql injection um with

400
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,240
what you can test it with

401
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,760
if you can get it to give you the error

402
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,959
then you can work your way from there if

403
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,839
xxa

404
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,920
for example don't just go ahead and try

405
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,600
read some internal files

406
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,560
try just a basic doctype replace see if

407
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,680
it's actually gonna

408
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,079
execute that see what isn't working what

409
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,800
is

410
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,760
um and it says there start harmless and

411
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
then go malicious now by malicious i

412
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,600
don't mean become a criminal

413
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,680
and exploit their system and be a bad

414
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,120
person no

415
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
what this means is and i'll give you an

416
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,079
example so if you watched my stream with

417
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,399
ben

418
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,240
at ben's stream sign i joined the stream

419
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,000
and chat picked a target and they picked

420
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
rockstar games

421
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,360
now starting harmless means you give

422
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,839
the website what they're expecting to

423
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,279
make the feature work

424
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,600
so in this case there was a return url

425
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,800
on rockstar games

426
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,360
um so we give it rockstar games that's a

427
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,240
harmless payload

428
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,839
they're expecting that that's what they

429
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,240
want but then we want to start making it

430
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
malicious okay let's work out what

431
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
they're looking for here so if i tried

432
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
shawn dot rockstar games do they still

433
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,480
trust it okay

434
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,639
and you work your way through there are

435
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,720
they got the trailing slash for example

436
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,399
because if not i could try rockstar

437
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,000
games dot computer

438
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,959
um what about local relative redirects

439
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
so just forward slash test

440
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,040
do they instead they automatically input

441
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,959
for me the rockstargames.com forward

442
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,160
slash test

443
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,639
or does it just redirect to forward test

444
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,240
and they're trusting the browser

445
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
to handle all of that for me is there

446
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,079
some sort of logic going on there where

447
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,399
they're

448
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,040
forcing it to be rockstar games how does

449
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,880
it handle different characters

450
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,360
so you're starting off harmless and

451
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
you're working your way to malicious

452
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
and then you're being the best person in

453
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,199
the world by reporting it and hopefully

454
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,399
getting a bounty if you find a bug

455
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
so understanding your features and then

456
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,519
understanding the payloads that you're

457
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,120
chucking at it and what's working what's

458
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,880
reflected and how it's handling it

459
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,959
because sometimes some bugs are

460
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,639
vulnerable to more than one thing

461
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,920
you might find stored xss or some xss

462
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,839
but maybe it's also vulnerable to

463
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,760
sql injection you don't know you know

464
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,600
what i mean you test some things see how

465
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,160
things work

466
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,560
now this some is some advice now

467
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,079
this isn't a tip such as this advice

468
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,920
finding a program to hack on

469
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,160
so we've learned to not spray and pray

470
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,959
we've learned to

471
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,800
work out how features work etcetera

472
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
etcetera

473
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,800
now finding a program to hack on this is

474
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
something a lot of people struggle with

475
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
um newcomers they join

476
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,399
um they're recommended to do i mean find

477
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,880
some flags or be active etc and prove

478
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,920
you can hack and you'll

479
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,279
receive some invites most people tell me

480
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,360
that the invites they receive

481
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
aren't that good they're not that

482
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,720
interested not that active

483
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,440
like etcetera and yeah that's fair play

484
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,360
and that's why with bug bounties

485
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,040
ultimately you can take the success into

486
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,079
your own hands

487
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,079
now there is no special source

488
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,000
and there is no way for me to tell you

489
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,720
go hack here you will find bugs because

490
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,800
a program that i might succeed in you

491
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,079
might not succeed and you might find

492
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,680
frustrating you hate it and you're like

493
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,600
how do sean find bugs here

494
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,759
it's about what works for you what do

495
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,639
you enjoy on

496
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,880
um if you can enjoy hacking on the site

497
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,079
that you're hacking on

498
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,519
you're gonna have so much more of a good

499
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,199
time because when you're digging deeper

500
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,639
and finer things you get that

501
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,519
hacker dopamine rush you get that this

502
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,160
the

503
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,079
tingling senses see feelings you know

504
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,279
what i mean anyway it's like oh

505
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
what's going on i want to find out and

506
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,639
then when you actually get the bug it's

507
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,839
like whoa

508
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,959
you feel proud of it you know what i

509
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,800
mean whereas i have looked at some

510
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,160
targets where it's like

511
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,600
i really don't just don't enjoy the

512
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,079
sight

513
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,519
like there's not a lot to play with

514
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,440
there's not a lot to do as such

515
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
um that's not necessarily saying you

516
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,880
should walk away from that program

517
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,800
because there might be some bugs but

518
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
enjoying the site you're hacking on will

519
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,880
help you be a lot more successful in my

520
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,240
opinion because you're going to enjoy it

521
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,959
aren't you

522
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,680
now i've also put there do not rely on

523
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,199
bug mounting platforms to send you

524
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:31,839
invites

525
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,600
in order for you to be successful at bug

526
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,680
money um bug bounties

527
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,040
because in my opinion that's step one to

528
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
burn out now

529
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,320
what you define a success is up to you

530
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,000
um i know there's probably some people

531
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,519
at bug banking platform shaking their

532
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,880
head at that right now

533
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,560
but this is coming from somebody that's

534
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,160
had years of experience with

535
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,240
bug platforms and hacking and i've heard

536
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,600
from lots of people and things like that

537
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
again what you define as successful

538
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,959
is up to you that might be one bug a

539
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,519
month that might be just your first ever

540
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,359
bug that might just be your first ever

541
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,400
critical bug

542
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,919
that might be you quitting your

543
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,760
full-time job to become a full-time bug

544
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,359
bounty hunter

545
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,720
the reason i say don't rely on bug

546
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,640
making platforms to send you invites

547
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,919
is because well you ta

548
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,839
you put in your success kind of in

549
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,520
someone else's hand and let's say into

550
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,039
them like well hey come on

551
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
send me some invites do whatever whereas

552
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,799
you'll discover

553
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,080
majority of companies welcome hackers um

554
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,640
and you shouldn't rely on invites it's

555
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,679
just

556
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,919
i could sit here for ages talking about

557
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,600
this but

558
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,520
it's probably for another video but yeah

559
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,360
that's not to say by the way i'll just

560
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
go back on that

561
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,600
you should 100 join every single bug

562
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,120
making platform don't mean join every

563
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,240
single one

564
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,919
definitely and if they send you invites

565
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,840
check it out on whatever but don't rely

566
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,280
on them that's that's what i'm trying to

567
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,240
get across don't

568
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,080
think oh i'm going to join a bug money

569
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
platform get really high up in the

570
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,960
rankings

571
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,559
prove whatever and hope they send me

572
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,880
invites because

573
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,799
potentially yeah might work in some

574
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,000
people's cases but

575
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,880
ultimately no and yeah it's a lot better

576
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
to kind of take the success

577
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,200
in your own hands and we i will explain

578
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,000
a little bit more

579
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,280
in a bit now when you're picking a

580
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,000
program

581
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,679
and i'm going to give you some help and

582
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,960
let's say i'm going to do some homework

583
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,480
at the end of this believe it or not to

584
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,840
get you going so and you're not going to

585
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,120
have to get invited to nothing for this

586
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,320
don't worry

587
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,440
so aim to at least spend at least six

588
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
months poking at your target

589
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,120
bigger the scope the better um because

590
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,160
bigger the scope

591
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,360
think about different teams different

592
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,080
code bases perhaps a different um

593
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,400
language site like for example i know a

594
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,840
bug bounty program where

595
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,679
their dot com and their cn are

596
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,200
completely different code bases

597
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
different teams whatever

598
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,600
um there you go so the bugs you're

599
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
finding on.com

600
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,000
there's gonna be completely different

601
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,840
things on cn and i wonder how many

602
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,440
people actually go visit other different

603
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,160
websites

604
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
um i'm thinking not many if i'm honest

605
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,240
um

606
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,600
the reason i say bigger the scope the

607
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
better because well

608
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
percy for me i like to really dig deep

609
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
into a program lots to play with

610
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
and the bigger the scope and the more to

611
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
play with the more mistakes the more

612
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,320
mistakes more bounty's coming your way

613
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,000
now if you're not prepared to put the

614
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
time in in my opinion don't be expect to

615
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,000
find much don't expect to find much

616
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
sorry um or if you are just going to put

617
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,520
like let's say

618
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,840
just whatever not a lot of time run some

619
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,200
tools then you're probably just going to

620
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,559
find some dupes

621
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,400
now i'm not saying you need to sit there

622
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,039
and put

623
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,520
me in a full eight-hour day learning to

624
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,760
hack or hacking or whatever

625
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,600
but don't just look at a target and skip

626
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,640
through it so quickly

627
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,200
actually feel confident that the site is

628
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,760
secure

629
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
feel confident that you could at the end

630
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,679
of this test that you were giving them

631
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,799
say you should be proud of how secure

632
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,520
your website

633
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,080
is um and this is where your notes will

634
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
come into play because you'll be writing

635
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
lots of notes as you're going along

636
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,799
but yeah

637
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,240
like i say while everyone's waiting for

638
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,320
private invites

639
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,799
naffy just goes in the hacks on google

640
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,080
for a couple of months right

641
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,000
and fair play he has so much experience

642
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
of hacking

643
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,000
but there's nothing nothing stopping any

644
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,240
of you viewers right now watching this

645
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,480
to learn google for the next 12 months

646
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,360
and crush it

647
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,880
you don't need to prove that you can

648
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
hack to anyone you don't need

649
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,000
to hack for free on vdps to get private

650
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
invites and all this and that this

651
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,919
in my opinion is what a bug bounty

652
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,679
program vulnerability disclosure program

653
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,000
is

654
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,799
it's a company who believes they have

655
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,760
their defenses

656
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,679
in place and they are saying to the

657
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,799
world hey

658
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,360
if you can find ways around our defenses

659
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,000
we will pay

660
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
for vulnerabilities they've not had to

661
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
make you jump through hoops because

662
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,840
that's in my opinion not what a bug

663
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,919
bounty program and crowd source security

664
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,880
is it's not really

665
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,360
crowd source security if it's cherry

666
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,799
picked security is it

667
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,480
in my opinion so that's why i say

668
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,000
take the success into your own hand

669
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,080
because there's nothing stopping any of

670
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,400
you

671
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,919
from looking on google and other bug

672
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,520

673
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,600
apple etc so

674
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
third tip sharing is caring and how you

675
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
can create a lead for yourself i

676
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,240
actually give this as a training session

677
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,640
for

678
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
um bug by hunting members um we

679
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,919
dissected some

680
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,840
um write-ups and we went against the

681
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,000
program and had some fun

682
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,760
now i'm big believe in shows caring i

683
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,679
try share i've shared lots of rights up

684
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,320
over the years uh tutorials and things

685
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,799
now

686
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,799
one big problem i ran into is companies

687
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,120
don't want me to disclose bugs no no no

688
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,960
sean sign an nda

689
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,919
or if i ask to disclose a bug they don't

690
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,640
tell me no

691
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,640
instead they ban me um so in all honesty

692
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,520
i give up asking to disclose my my

693
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,760
research and my findings because it's

694
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,480
just

695
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
a ball lake right now so this is why

696
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,919
it's massive motivation for me actually

697
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,760
making barker and bug bounty hunter

698
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,320
because

699
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,559
no one can stop me from recreating the

700
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,440
bugs i've found

701
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,039
and making a web application full of

702
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,039
these actual bugs john i mean

703
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,760
um so that is a big part of actually bob

704
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,120
barker and bug money hunter and the

705
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,720
challenges and fast food hackings it's

706
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
all the bugs i found just recreated for

707
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,720
you to find because

708
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,240
well i can't get in trouble for that can

709
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,760
i because i haven't named names and i

710
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,039
haven't disclosed stuff

711
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,760
and you can then also get the benefit of

712
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,440
learning how to find it yourself

713
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
by understanding how the web application

714
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,360
works

715
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,559
so with that said though lots of people

716
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:36,880
share

717
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
lots of epic write-ups and these

718
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,400
write-ups

719
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
not all write-ups have good information

720
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,520
because some write-ups

721
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,039
are just a basic summary and don't have

722
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,760
a lot but some write-ups are gold

723
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
so much information and they can help

724
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,880
you find bugs

725
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,000
so you just digest disclosed issues and

726
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
you can create us lead and like a

727
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,039
starting point for yourself you

728
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,919
literally can go

729
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,240
test to disclose bugs and place yourself

730
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
in the same place as the other hacker

731
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,720
find that request that they've talked

732
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,320
about or potentially i haven't spoke

733
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,760
about but they've spoke about a certain

734
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
feature go find that request

735
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,840
go find how it's been fixed because

736
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,720
potentially

737
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,240
you might find a way around it you might

738
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,400
find a bypass every hacker approaches

739
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
things differently

740
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,240
or it might lead on to more bugs

741
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,760
potentially this hacker because it

742
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,480
happens

743
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
it happens you get a hack a dopamine

744
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,200
rush you find a bug you're so excited

745
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,480
maybe you've been looking at it for two

746
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,280
hours

747
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,919
you feel complete so you submit it and

748
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,520
then you go away

749
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,280
potentially there are similar bugs

750
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,600
related to what's been disclosed

751
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,400
more than likely yes because developers

752
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,159
reuse code

753
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,919
and depend on what the bug is maybe it's

754
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,640
a site-wide issue

755
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,440
i'll give you an example sam curry and

756
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,120
everyone else who contributes that their

757
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,240
post on apple

758
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,840
is gold there are so many key areas in

759
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,360
that post right if you seriously read

760
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,960
his post in detail and understand

761
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
where they looked for those bugs right

762
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,400
follow their footsteps literally go

763
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
follow their footsteps

764
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,720
you will see yeah like i says there i'll

765
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,159
let you work it out

766
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,360
i'm not gonna yeah go have a look at

767
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,960
sam's post

768
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,400
read what they did follow their

769
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
footsteps log the request

770
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,640
you'll be going down the rabbit hole and

771
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,880
again you don't need an invite to this

772
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,440
program

773
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
there is so much and yeah i personally

774
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,320
know that people are killing it on apple

775
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,360
so like i say

776
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,840
digesting the information read it

777
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,720
finding the

778
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,039
parameters that were used endpoints used

779
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,120
the bug type where it was found etc etc

780
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,360
um so with that said everyone

781
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,200
your target for the next 12 months

782
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,799
is going to be google vrp

783
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,360
and so if you all want to check out

784
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,080
david

785
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,120
who's ex david who's post

786
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,760
on github there huge shout out to him

787
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,400
for contributing this and creating this

788
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,520
um and i want everyone to tweet over

789
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,600
over the next 12 months and let me know

790
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,200
how you're getting on i'm gonna run

791
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,120
through what your tasks are do not worry

792
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,600
so before i go through those i just

793
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,200
wanna real quickly

794
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,640
just run through very very quickly

795
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,320
first tip understand the features and

796
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,080
what you're looking for so

797
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,480
logins updating your information and

798
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,840
whatever features they offer you

799
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,799
developer tools

800
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,520
mobile apps etc second tip don't just

801
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,559
spray and pray

802
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,720
understand what it is you are testing

803
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
and what you expect it to be vulnerable

804
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:40,799
to

805
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,039
try various payloads try harmless

806
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,720
payloads that they're expecting and work

807
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,919
your way to malicious

808
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,159
and how you can create impact second of

809
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,120
all

810
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,279
yes sign up to every bug bounty program

811
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,039
a platform out there sorry

812
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,559
but don't rely on them to send you

813
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,720
invites in order to be successful

814
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,039
um again or successful is up to you

815
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,360
and if you're watching this thinking

816
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,039
well i'm probably not gonna have a lot

817
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,480
of time to get in the bug boundaries and

818
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,080
you're not actually up for spending the

819
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,720
good six

820
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,520
twelve months of this then this probably

821
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,480
isn't for you

822
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,400
um then yeah there's enough for you and

823
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,679
the money

824
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,200
and lastly the last tip let's say

825
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,240
creating the lead which is what we're

826
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,919
going to go through now with your task

827
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:20,480
everyone

828
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,279
so if everyone is ready let's do this so

829
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,640
if you can see here

830
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
i literally opened this github didn't

831
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
open any posts just had a little look at

832
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,039
what they were called and this what the

833
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,159
idol one i

834
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,559
i know i idols in my opinion are just as

835
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,600
common as xss

836
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,080
so i clicked onto it i read through it

837
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,760
and i've highlighted here in my opinion

838
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,000
what i think is interesting

839
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,240
guessing the idea here is not possible

840
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,960
but if the victim shared his file the id

841
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
will be visible in the path he got five

842
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,159
thousand dollars

843
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,200
um and it was vulnerable to idle

844
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,000
so say to me any other time you see a

845
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
similar id like this

846
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
you should try for idol because maybe

847
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
the developers had the same for

848
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,679
no one like maybe google developers or

849
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,440
whoever coded this as such didn't think

850
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
this but potentially they thought

851
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,120
no one's probably going to try another

852
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,640
value here because they're not going to

853
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,559
be able to work out how to get this

854
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,200
and do you know what i mean um how do we

855
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,960
also know if you try just an integer

856
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,559
value there what about if you try the

857
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,080
value just one or

858
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,279
100 whatever maybe it'll respond um

859
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,080
you never know so that was literally

860
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,720
from me

861
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,480
that that's me just looking at that post

862
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,320
instantly and i'll be i'd go test that

863
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,520
now data studio

864
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,240
and i'd also consider is there any of

865
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,080
that same code in date studio

866
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,600
potentially other people have found this

867
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,919
because it was a 2019 post admittedly

868
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,000
but potentially throughout data studio

869
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
there were similar bugs

870
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
the code was reused do i say developers

871
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,960
reuse code

872
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,720
trend is your friend yeah so everyone

873
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,240
your task

874
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,039
first of all digest all google vrp

875
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,399
write-ups that you can find

876
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,000
whether that's on github whether there's

877
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,840
this other blog posts

878
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,039
whether you know some friends

879
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,520
obviously shouldn't just don't just um

880
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,880
share private information and search

881
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,159
between me if i can give you some hints

882
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,600
or anything like that but yeah

883
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
so write endpoints directories and

884
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,720
parameters used

885
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,520
so where was this bug found so let's say

886
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,320
for example it was example.google.com

887
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,039
forward slash friend service forward

888
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,559
slash

889
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,440
whatever whatever go google doc for the

890
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,760
friend

891
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,240
service maybe that leads on to more api

892
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,320
calls and things like that

893
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,760
same with the parameters are these

894
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,840
parameters used everywhere anywhere else

895
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,120
what's going on

896
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,919
um what was the bug found was it a

897
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,120
simple idol

898
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,799
in front of literally everyone did the

899
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,279
xss require a special bypass

900
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,240
um was it a really cool chain where they

901
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,880
needed to

902
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
use an open redirect with the server

903
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,559
side request forgery to get this

904
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,120
and pull this do that what was required

905
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,399
here

906
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,240
and then not only that but think about

907
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,760
how has the developer fixed it

908
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
because not only when you're going to go

909
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,520
test it but how have they fixed it so

910
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,120
obviously with xss you can fix them

911
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,960
relatively easy but if it's a

912
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
complicated bug where you're sending

913
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
some sort of server aside request

914
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,039
forgery

915
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,279
server side request but that's what the

916
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,720
features intended to do how did the

917
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,480
developer stop it from being malicious

918
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
and broken what did they do

919
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,320
and where was it found basically um

920
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,000
like i said i put this test various ways

921
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,919
to buy test various ways to um

922
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,159
to bypass it and there's actually a

923
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,440
bypass i actually found there on a

924
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,279
heavily tested website recently

925
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,960
where they wanted it to end in jpeg.png

926
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,080
and if i put dot html.jpg

927
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,559
it and it actually saved it as just

928
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,600
file.html

929
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,159
and again write lots and lots of notes

930
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,679
trust me because

931
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,919
when you look through google you're

932
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,840
gonna find things that look so similar

933
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,919
and you're gonna be able to like say

934
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,120
pick up the trend as your friend and be

935
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,559
able to know i know what this is used

936
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,640
for i know where this is blah blah blah

937
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,360
and you'll pick it up trust me you need

938
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,799
to trust the process

939
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,320
and that's why hopefully a lot of you

940
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,279
are gonna follow these tasks i've said

941
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,480
a second task everyone

942
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,480
now so you're digesting all this

943
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
information as to where these bugs were

944
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,080
found

945
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,279
xss idols what was going on now your

946
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,279
task is to continue hunting for the next

947
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,399
12 months but not just go overline on

948
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,520
recon

949
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,200
just don't go just run your recon

950
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,480
scanners and i've got a lot of sub

951
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,799
domains and i'm just going to do this

952
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,600
um rather we're going to be focused on

953
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,480
web apps

954
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,840
ones you can interact with log upload

955
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,320
stuff

956
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,159
post stuff and things like that you want

957
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,760
things that has lots to play with

958
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,600
because there's lots of new code shipped

959
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,799
regularly because

960
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,960
even though there's posts um were

961
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,559
disclosed a while ago and they weren't

962
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,279
fixed

963
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,840
how did you know old code wasn't

964
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
reintroduced

965
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,520
so find yes we've got to do recon on

966
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,039
google because there's lots out there

967
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,000
john i mean

968
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
and there's not just one single hub

969
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,679
point you log into google drive

970
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,200
the main idea of google is the search

971
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,960
engine but they've got google mail

972
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,279
google ads etc etc

973
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,159
so find all google sub domains and

974
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,159
domains because i believe

975
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,039
without looking um a lot of stuff of

976
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,720
google is in scope

977
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,200
i have to check this but check their

978
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
policy of what's in scope but find all

979
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,440
google

980
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,200
sub domains that everything that's in

981
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,760
scope you can log in and interact with

982
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,880
because that's the thing you want to

983
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,799
understand how these things work and

984
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,120
break these features

985
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,480
and not only that but when you're doing

986
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,320
your recon you'll make sense of what the

987
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,600
recon means

988
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
you understand what this subdomain does

989
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,519
what you can do of it

990
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,679
so make sure you can edit your profile

991
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,679
post some content upload some stuff

992
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,399
etc but check is the login flowy the

993
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,240
same each time every single time

994
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,960
you're logging into the subdomain so

995
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,720
mail.google.com

996
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,720
ads.google.com etc is it the same is it

997
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,159
the same on mobile device

998
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,640
is it the same on android and iphone you

999
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,320
can actually get

1000
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,480
iphone and android user agent in your

1001
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,080
browser from an extension on either

1002
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,440
firefox or google

1003
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
uh chrome um so you don't actually need

1004
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,279
the device to test it how does each

1005
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,000
thing work

1006
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,120
did they all work the same um and

1007
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,159
another common thing

1008
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,840
is google don't really care because it's

1009
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,279
actually in their policy they don't care

1010
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,200
about open redirects right

1011
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
so with that in mind you're going to

1012
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
probably find a lot of them out there

1013
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,120
so what can they be used for leaking

1014
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
tokens service request 4g and things

1015
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,679
like that

1016
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,200
um so yeah

1017
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,559
but not only that but test and

1018
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,799
understand how each feature

1019
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,519
works so and this goes back to not just

1020
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,279
trying one bug type everywhere

1021
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,399
so for example on google ads you can

1022
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,399
invite other users so

1023
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,840
let's say for example you invited

1024
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,080
another user can you set

1025
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,559
permission and roles to this user and

1026
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,320
are these permissions and roles working

1027
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,200
correctly

1028
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,360
do they work correctly is there a google

1029
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
ads mobile app

1030
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,279
has it might not be vulnerable on the on

1031
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,320
the desktop version

1032
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,919
what about the mobile app what about if

1033
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,200
it's a completely different team what

1034
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
about if they outsourced it a while ago

1035
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
to get something developed

1036
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,320
just to get it off the ground and

1037
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,480
they've never really got it changed

1038
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,120
you don't know go test and see how it's

1039
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,840
working

1040
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,919
and again this is why it can take a long

1041
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,320
time to really dive deep into programs

1042
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
and web applications and understand

1043
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,360
how they work but honestly if you follow

1044
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,120
the advice from here for the next 12

1045
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,000
months please do

1046
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,799
keep me if you do um try this out please

1047
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,159
do keep me updated with how you're

1048
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,200
getting on and

1049
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,000
i'd love to know because i'm honestly

1050
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,279
going to do it as well with you

1051
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,039
um just not probably as long not as like

1052
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,320
i said not as long but probably not as

1053
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,679
much as you like because i don't have

1054
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,200
the time really

1055
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,880
um but yeah so it may be daunting at

1056
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,919
first everyone

1057
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,840
what do these parameters do what does

1058
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,000
this mean what what happens

1059
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,200
if you're completely brand new and you

1060
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,960
don't understand anything about hacking

1061
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,880
one hundred percent you need to go away

1062
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,360
and unders like learn learn hacking

1063
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,159
basically

1064
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,320
check out pentester lab bug bank hunter

1065
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,200
the hacking 101 and things like that and

1066
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,600
understand learn check out videos on

1067
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,200
youtube tutorials and understand what

1068
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,280
hacking is etc

1069
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,800
um but unders once you've been looking

1070
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,599
on google

1071
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,040
and you understand what the parameters

1072
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,639
do and things like that

1073
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,239
then it will kind of over time make

1074
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,800
sense to you um

1075
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,359
we've all been there i've been there all

1076
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,440
the top hackers have been there

1077
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,879
think about it it's fresh to you you're

1078
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,719
attacking it blindly aren't you

1079
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,440
um but like i say the more you focus on

1080
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,879
the target everyone the more you

1081
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,800
understand i've seen this parameter

1082
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,399
being used i've seen this i know this is

1083
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:36,800
the

1084
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,679
crosstalk crest 4g token the more you

1085
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,119
test it and the more you click around

1086
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:41,679
and use

1087
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,399
and make sure to write notes the more

1088
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,359
you will begin

1089
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,199
to see the more you'll be able again to

1090
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,800
say oh well i actually can

1091
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,839
do this and this happens um let's say

1092
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,239
rather than just focus on one bug type

1093
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,719
i believe in you all though trust me

1094
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,480
there are bugs out there

1095
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,920
like i say i've hacked with members on

1096
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
bug bounty hunter of hack events on

1097
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,160
a public program which people thought i

1098
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
mean i'm not going to find anything on

1099
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,079
here

1100
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,079
and i literally showed them how step by

1101
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,000
step we digest the information and what

1102
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,680
to do with this and talking and leading

1103
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,320
on to things

1104
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,079
and they're all now finding bugs by

1105
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,839
themselves on this program without me

1106
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,079
you can do the same you just got to put

1107
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,599
the time and the effort and actually

1108
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,240
want it

1109
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
and actually be like okay i want to make

1110
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,760
a complete mind map of how

1111
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,000
everything on google works what ones can

1112
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,480
i log in what functionality do they have

1113
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,920
have any old bugs been found in these

1114
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,480
sub domains and you'll get it

1115
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,720
good luck everyone and happy hacking i

1116
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,480
hope you've enjoyed my talk

1117
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,960
i hope i haven't rambled and bored you

1122
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,599
some bounties because trust me

1123
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,760
they are out there pete
