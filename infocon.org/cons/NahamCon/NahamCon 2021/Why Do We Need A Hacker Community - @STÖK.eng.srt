very happy that you guys are here

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,680
so look i'm just gonna start this whole

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,120
conversation because it's not an

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
interview it's a conversation

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,719
with asking you what does the word

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,760
community

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
mean to you that's it i think setting

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
your terms is so important in this right

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,119
because it does mean a lot of different

34
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:07,520
things

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,159
to a lot of different people and um you

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,760
know i'll just speak from my perspective

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,479
and one of the

38
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,360
one of the resources that um i keep

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,080
coming back to

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,200
is a book written by um kyle mursotto

41
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,119
bailey richardson and kevin huen called

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:21,840
get together

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,520
and these are three people that built

44
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
instagram facebook ebay communities

45
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
something called creative mornings and

46
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,119
and their simple definition is a group

47
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,079
of people

48
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,000
that get together consistently for a

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
common cause

50
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
and so when i think of that um it

51
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,560
obviously means different things in an

52
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,759
online format

53
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,320
so you look at you could probably like

54
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,759
raise your hand and think what is a

55
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,759
a weekly group you get together whether

56
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,439
it's like michael like a poker group you

57
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,200
you consistently play poker with or

58
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,560
whatever you're like

59
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,399
like it's not a work related things like

60
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,759
these are communities that i keep

61
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,439
investing in and i will come back to

62
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,360
i play baseball every tuesday night or i

63
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,040
go swimming or i go jogging with these

64
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,240
people doesn't have to be athletic

65
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,119
oriented

66
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,040
or hobby oriented but that's typically

67
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
when we think of communities it's like

68
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
i enjoy this and a common cause and you

69
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,119
consistently get together

70
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,440
so that's like my kind of like simple

71
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,160
definition

72
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,760
it can you know you can go off on

73
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,599
different paths from there but i always

74
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,120
love that because it does simplify

75
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
at least if they're not getting together

76
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
consistently

77
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,640
and or there's not leaders that like if

78
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,080
that leader wasn't there running that

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,599
particular meetup or doing that

80
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,160
particular thing

81
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,280
what do you do you have something that

82
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
has longevity do you have something that

83
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,599
has value

84
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,280
and so i think that about that a lot

85
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,440
from the hacker one perspective like

86
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,599
we have a five to six person team on the

87
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,560
community team at

88
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,360
hackerone and how do you like actually

89
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,120
impact and influence a broader audience

90
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
and that's where i think developing

91
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
leaders and having community people

92
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
content creators like yourself and and

93
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,280
having

94
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,519
more than just luke tucker like you've

95
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,800
heard of the dunbar rule you can only

96
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
really reach about 150 people in any

97
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,160
meaningful way he basically is like you

98
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,440
can really only have meaningful

99
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
relationships with about 150 people

100
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
in your life that's that's kind of the

101
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,720
like the max cap

102
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
of what you can typically have a

103
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
meaningful relationship with

104
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,080
and usually it's much smaller like you

105
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
think of someone like uh

106
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,920
you know jesus had lots of disciples but

107
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
he chose 12 that he invested a lot of

108
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,879
time into

109
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,120
and then that was really the core so you

110
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,640
think of like that element of like to

111
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,239
really reach the masses and to go out

112
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
you have to really kind of focus on

113
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,360
a smaller number of people that are

114
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,120
going to drive an outsize impact because

115
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,640
you naturally can't

116
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,680
really pour yourself into

117
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,239
150 people even you can know in 150

118
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,360
people but

119
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
there's no way you're gonna really be

120
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
able to intimately

121
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,640
stay accountable accountability to me is

122
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
an important part of community

123
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
if you don't have accountability within

124
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,720
the people if someone's not gonna ask

125
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,000
hey where's luke this week

126
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
hey where's michael this week what's

127
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,519
what's stoke up to then i think

128
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,720
there's a missing element and then

129
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
that's part of like doing life together

130
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,879
community is doing life together or

131
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,239
achieving a goal together you've heard

132
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,000
of mastermind groups like championed by

133
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,040
napoleon hill

134
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,239
a century ago but people are craving

135
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
the authenticity and the originality and

136
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
the voices

137
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
from people in the community like

138
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,879
yourself that are okay and being

139
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,519
vulnerable

140
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,799
and i think there's just so much hunger

141
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,560
for it and that's you know excited to

142
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
talk more about vibe squad and what what

143
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
you're doing and homies we're here at

144
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,640
namco

145
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,200
and things like that that's really cool

146
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,079
so michael

147
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,399
do you have 150 people that you're close

148
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,638
with

149
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,479
yeah i guess i mean for

150
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,160
or you or do you have 151 you maybe have

151
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,639
200.

152
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,919
that'll be the dick thing right i'd be

153
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
like no no i have 150 what no um

154
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,400
yeah yeah no i i'd agree with that i'd

155
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,520
say there's definitely

156
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,240
the the people that you have that you're

157
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,800
driving

158
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
focus in it and i think for those of us

159
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
that do community it's because we also

160
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
understand that

161
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
there is a finite number of people you

162
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,720
can have that direct connection with and

163
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,199
making youtube content or a blog article

164
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,080
or you know

165
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,639
running a live event brings more people

166
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
together and you get to touch more lives

167
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,440
than if you're

168
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
you know just having those individual

169
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
interactions i think that is definitely

170
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
for all of us in our own understanding

171
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
how we've seen communities

172
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and being able to reach more people and

173
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
have others

174
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,880
you know create more of an evergreen

175
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,960
experience instead of these you know

176
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
ephemeral ones that constantly happen

177
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
throughout the day there's a big

178
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,759
difference between having

179
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,240
a community and an audience an audience

180
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,440
is somebody that

181
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
i don't mean like let's say newsletter

182
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
or something or if you're

183
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
just if you're tweeting on twitter

184
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,199
but you're not um you know have your

185
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
comments enabled or it's just one-way

186
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,479
communication

187
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,600
then it's an audience but if your

188
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
audience is starting to talk to each

189
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
other and helping each other out now you

190
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,039
have a community because

191
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,039
then there's going to be interactions

192
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,199
and they they foster each other and that

193
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,680
kind of

194
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,880
way and how do you guys think about

195
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
the idea of of discord as a

196
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
communication channel

197
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,479
versus let's say a newsletter yeah

198
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,240
i can start off on that too because i

199
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
think you you touched on the interesting

200
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,080
point of like audience versus community

201
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
and i think it's a both and not an

202
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,240
either or and what i mean by that

203
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,759
is you know like when you think of the

204
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,199
typical media it's like usually

205
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,840
broadcast

206
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919
right like you said like a one-way i'm

207
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,680
here on stage presenting and speaking

208
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,199
and there's no interaction there's no

209
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,160
dynamic

210
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,919
uh when you when you add a live element

211
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,039
live tv is always kind of like

212
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,080
interesting is what's going to happen

213
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,199
something could break something you'd

214
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,639
have like especially in the field right

215
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,520
leaving today

216
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,039
how many youtube videos of like crazy

217
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,560
things happening right someone running

218
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
in the background or like live sports

219
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,440
there's there's an attraction to it

220
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,479
there's just like this what's going to

221
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,520
happen next

222
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
um and so i think where where media has

223
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
evolved obviously with social and and

224
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,479
now

225
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,039
creative economy those people you need

226
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,479
to build an audience to be able to at

227
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,080
least have your kind of like

228
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,520
when you want to be a distribution like

229
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
a monolithic i want to direct a channel

230
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,039
like this is what i'm going to own

231
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,240
so with like youtube discord

232
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,280
uh slack um other tools where you're

233
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,400
communicating the twitch the

234
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,479
proliferation of technology it's so easy

235
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,479
to spin it up it's hard to maintain

236
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,840
and you've got to find what's right for

237
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,759
you so like soak in your example right

238
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,160
like

239
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,599
we've tagged conversations around you

240
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,880
need to build a newsletter you need to

241
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
build a voice

242
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
and a list of people that that's going

243
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
to be a channel you own

244
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
and that's portable whether you use

245
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,479
convertkit whether you use mailchimp

246
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,599
whether you use

247
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,680
uh insert here send fox whatever tool

248
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,720
you're going to use

249
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
that email list is currency and that's a

250
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,400
relationship that you can directly

251
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,599
communicate to them

252
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,759
and then youtube you get you might have

253
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,120
like people can comment on it but it's

254
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,560
very rarely you like maybe comment they

255
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
feel special

256
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,759
and so i think audience is an important

257
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,440
aspect it gives you a platform and again

258
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
you're the only way you're going to get

259
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,520
that is consistency and personality

260
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
and all the things that you've brought

261
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,319
to the table in your your content

262
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,400
creation and the others out there

263
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
be able to have a community there

264
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
everyone craves that that

265
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
that ephemeral access but the best

266
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,039
result is when the community is helping

267
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,759
each other

268
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,120
like you mentioned like people that are

269
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
just passionate about like hand raisers

270
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
i have a quote i'd rather cool down a

271
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,800
fanatic than warm up a corpse

272
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
meaning those people that are just

273
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
fanatical about like getting involved

274
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
like they might be a little bit out

275
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,440
there

276
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
but yeah come one come on like be able

277
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,879
to drive something you want to own like

278
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,479
just be a senior moderator and you get

279
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,160
clout and you get special things within

280
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,960
discord

281
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
i think discord is probably the most

282
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,639
interesting tool i think they have

283
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,160
a really interesting founder story and

284
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
they're doing good things and it really

285
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
integrates well with the twitch

286
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,240
experience

287
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,919
but slack has its own benefits and

288
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,000
things that we've used you know

289
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
time and again for live hacking events

290
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,000
because uh there's just other

291
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,280
areas where we're more comfortable in

292
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
that tool it proliferates easier it's

293
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,159
easier for

294
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,958
sharing data whatever um you know rit

295
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,080
team is more comfortable with that than

296
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,958
discord but

297
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,799
we also build the hacka101 education

298
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,719
discord through

299
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,640
that place where it's centered on

300
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,399
education and here we're here to educate

301
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
we can't always provide support we just

302
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,399
don't use that for a support channel

303
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,320
but like michael's point is really great

304
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
as we scale as these communities scale

305
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,839
and i also expand the definition of it's

306
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,519
not just hacker one's community like

307
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,920
we're all here to drive forward that the

308
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,600
hackers are a force for good

309
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,519
that everybody any company any

310
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,720
organization should

311
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,839
be open to receive

312
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,320
help from hackers i i think i want to

313
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,200
talk about bug bounty

314
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,399
we're known as like bug bounty

315
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,320
communities right crowd source security

316
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,279
yeah we call it um where i'm saying i'd

317
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:15,760
like just

318
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
you would be curious within this

319
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,680
conversation like

320
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
a lot of the perception for like tried

321
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
and true security like

322
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,480
really like you know low-level stuff or

323
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,160
really in-depth research and their

324
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,800
perspective

325
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,240
when they look at like bug bounty

326
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
programs and it's predominantly seen

327
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
in my perspective it's like web app

328
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
hackers or script kitties being a

329
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
pejorative term that's thrown around

330
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,760
like

331
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
i i sense some of that similar kind of

332
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,279
like disdain

333
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,760
or just i don't i don't know maybe i'd

334
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,480
be curious

335
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,160
just stoke even your perception of what

336
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
you've seen or just even like at def con

337
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,360
in the halls that like drunk hacker

338
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,160
history and

339
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
there's elements of really respectful

340
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,200
incredibly brilliant people but

341
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,399
there's kind of like something looking

342
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,839
down on those that are like in bug

343
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
binding that's not true is it research

344
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
i don't want to get into a conversation

345
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
with is that true research or not but

346
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,720
i think we're all trying to move the

347
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,399
industry forward how do we how do we

348
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
help with a sea change of

349
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
the broader change in perception of like

350
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,279
there's actually really meaningful

351
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,560
work that's being done intelligent

352
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
people and exciting opportunity for

353
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,959
anybody that self-identifies as a hacker

354
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,200
to continue to do work in this i believe

355
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,480
our platforms are the future

356
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,839
of where you can get even more and more

357
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,279
done i don't know what do you think

358
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,000
about that

359
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the way to succeed in this is to add

360
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,279
more transparency

361
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,320
and as soon as any kind of program at

362
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,800
this

363
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,440
uh it's in it's an nda or we we do not

364
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,519
disclose or blah blah

365
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,920
certain hackers might just want to hack

366
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,279
on those programs but

367
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,079
none of those bugs would ever won't

368
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,200
won't see the day

369
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
uh there won't be any cvs there won't be

370
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,480
certain stuff but

371
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,240
because they're kind of like buying the

372
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,079
silence by

373
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,880
by having an invite-only very exclusive

374
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,839
program and

375
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,200
that's where some of the most

376
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
interesting research happens

377
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
yes there is a whole lot of noise and

378
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,880
you guys know that

379
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
there's a lot of people submitting a lot

380
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,720
of reports that are crap

381
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,200
but there then there's ten percent maybe

382
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
two percent maybe one percent

383
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,000
of really innovative out-of-the-box

384
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,360
thinking next kind of

385
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,640
brain mind-blowing research and that

386
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,680
research like

387
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
today alex version dropped his report

388
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,279
like

389
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,320
in in that's cool stuff when

390
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
when sam and it all released their stuff

391
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:25,920
they

392
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,959
they where they're hacked over at apple

393
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,399
that was so cool too

394
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,320
and there's been continuously over the

395
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,680
year certain stuff that's been released

396
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,160
but it's not to the pace where it needs

397
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,959
needs to be

398
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,120
because it's also competitive so if you

399
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
have something that's a really cool

400
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,600
research

401
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,240
that you kind of want to get out before

402
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
monetization was a part of it

403
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
you can just ah i got all these amazing

404
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,279
payloads

405
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,680
it's all cool i'm just gonna do it for

406
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,519
the clout or you will get some

407
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,440
some cred because you were a cool hacker

408
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,839
and now money is involved so everybody's

409
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
running their own small tiny businesses

410
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,240
and

411
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,480
like do i really want to share my secret

412
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,519
sauce

413
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,959
because everybody thinks i have the

414
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,639
secret sauce otherwise we wouldn't have

415
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,160
the conversation that

416
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
was a couple years back we're saying

417
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,240
triagers is stealing all my bugs

418
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,519
like oh yeah right but to go back to

419
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,600
your original question

420
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,680
does the rest of the community look at

421
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,519
bug hunters in a certain way yeah

422
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,399
probably

423
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
but then again they only see the noise

424
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,519
they don't see

425
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
what the one percenters create they miss

426
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,440
a tribute too

427
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
the interesting thing in pen testing

428
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,120
these days is that

429
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
a lot of innovation spins out of bug

430
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
bounty that they assume was a pentester

431
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,639
alex bernstein is a great example of

432
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,200
that

433
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,519
i saw yesterday on one of the slacks i

434
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,680
mean that's predominantly pen testers

435
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
and talk about it and then someone's

436
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,279
like oh they went for bounties for it

437
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,760
you know

438
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
and they were surprised it's like no

439
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
like you don't understand like bounties

440
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,040
was the driver to this

441
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,720
and there's so many you know i mean f

442
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
like we that's a great example of

443
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,079
something that's

444
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,480
coming out of this community and yes

445
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,160
it's it's cross-applicable

446
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
and you can use those i mean i was a pen

447
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
tester before this role and you use

448
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,120
those in both

449
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,959
but it was my bug bounty experience that

450
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,800
drove me to be a better pen tester not

451
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,160
my pen test experience

452
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
because i would get that salary either

453
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,519
way um

454
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,120
and there's a lot of people in that boat

455
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,279
i mean hat crawler exists because of bug

456
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,399
bounties even though

457
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,720
hack luke was working for fantastic he's

458
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,240
built it for bug bounties

459
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,360
you know and it i think the

460
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,000
the part that we're probably not great

461
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,480
at is

462
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
is kind of pointing out the research

463
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,880
like because that in my eyes is research

464
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,839
and

465
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,680
totally yeah we're liquids with that

466
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,519
that arguments that argument comes

467
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:43,920
around

468
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,839
all the time if you know they're not

469
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,959
researchers well

470
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,320
yes they are because

471
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,880
those things in my eyes are research

472
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,399
that pushes us forward it doesn't have

473
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,360
to be

474
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
net new bug class it can be net new

475
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,519
approach to a workflow

476
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,560
that's optimizing how the broader

477
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,440
security

478
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,320
community operates i mean if you wanted

479
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,959
to go

480
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,000
in terms of bug class it's arguable that

481
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,839
franz rosen is the founding father of

482
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,839
subdomain takeovers that came from bug

483
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,800
bounties

484
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
the pentest world is still playing catch

485
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,839
up on that and it's

486
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,240
six seven years later and that's not to

487
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
say pen testing's bad

488
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,959
but i think it misattributes successes

489
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,800
in the bug bounding community

490
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,839
as if their broader ped test successes

491
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,240
and doesn't feed it back the other way

492
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,639
and the ironic thing about being a pen

493
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,880
tester and i hire a lot of pentesters

494
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,959
into bug bounties is that there's

495
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,240
actually

496
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,120
the most exciting and deepest thought

497
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,000
i've seen in pen

498
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
and sorry in bug bounties where pen

499
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
testing tend to be more of a tick and

500
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,279
flick type approach

501
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,000
and it's pretty rare to find pen testers

502
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,720
that don't

503
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,360
you know tick flick move to the next one

504
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,560
last we got

505
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,920
a few more minutes why should one

506
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,480
build a community to go back to the

507
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
beginning right you can either touch 150

508
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
lives you can touch multiple and i think

509
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
building a community like hakka one's

510
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,600
education discord right

511
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,920
there's there's a way there for more

512
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,839
people to support each other

513
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,199
than if it was just you know individuals

514
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:19,839
doing it

515
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,880
um you look at it like um

516
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,240
ben's discord like i'm a i'm not very

517
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,560
active there but i've i've

518
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,639
watched and read and learnt from there

519
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,240
and you see you know people like donut

520
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,519
in there curating and helping that

521
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,199
community there's a number of people

522
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:35,920
that

523
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,839
allow that to grow and foster knowledge

524
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,680
in a broader spectrum than if ben was to

525
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,279
do it independently

526
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,320
and so i think the primary driver is you

527
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,800
know

528
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
we get to expand our knowledge base as a

529
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,560
whole and as a collective

530
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,279
you know wither community versus just

531
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,720
what could be done through direct

532
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
mentorship or direct training and that's

533
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,680
not to say that

534
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,120
that's not valuable but there's just so

535
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
much more information transfer that can

536
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,639
happen as a collective

537
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,839
luke final words final words yeah

538
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,480
i plus one to all that and i i'd answer

539
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,040
this in

540
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,680
i guess one with two ways one when you

541
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,959
look at startups and

542
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,040
companies and and you know building a

543
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,639
moat around your business

544
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,720
community is a defensible differentiator

545
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,399
you cannot no one can come in

546
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,120
and recreate overnight the communities

547
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
and the brand and the

548
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,399
the investment that people have in the

549
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,920
proof of work in the platforms that's a

550
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,959
big element right

551
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,399
where you started a lot of times you'll

552
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,480
continue because there's an element of i

553
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:32,880
have

554
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,720
clout here i have opportunity as a

555
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,079
result of my

556
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,360
proof-of-work investment so like the

557
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,839
building a startup it's the the word du

558
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,839
jour is building community and like

559
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,120
first round capital coming out and

560
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,600
saying like 80 of xyz want to build a

561
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
community there's

562
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,079
there's so much there like i think just

563
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,519
where our world is and what people are

564
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,720
hungry for that

565
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,279
community that connection that that um

566
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,560
that dynamic nature

567
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,040
and i the words from our investor bill

568
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,639
gurley ring in my ear and he's like luke

569
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,240
distributed and emergent

570
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,319
is what we're going for so crowdsourcing

571
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
by that nature is just a model where you

572
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,919
are actually taking in same as open

573
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,559
source

574
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,240
you're allowing and empowering through a

575
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,480
platform hundreds thousands of people to

576
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
be able to contribute where

577
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,720
i luke tucker michael stoke you we're

578
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,079
all one person and you

579
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,760
really have a finite limit of what you

580
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,599
can impact and so when you create that

581
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,400
platform

582
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
you provide a crowdsourced access and

583
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
you provide incentive to the right

584
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,439
things where you want attention

585
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,799
good things will happen that's that's

586
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,559
proof that's been proven from even

587
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,240
before our platforms were created

588
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
and the mozilla's and the googles and

589
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
even the facebooks that created their

590
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,280
own bug bounty and census before

591
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,960
now it's like this is a no-brainer

592
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,559
everybody should be doing these things

593
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,000
and so that's in our industry

594
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,039
but i think in general if you're

595
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,679
building community that is portable that

596
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,000
is

597
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,640
ownership that is value and you're going

598
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,760
to just see more and more from the

599
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,679
creator economy to startups to brands

600
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,880
that want to create that

601
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,679
and it's people i would just last notes

602
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,679
look at what clubhouse is doing with

603
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,280
um with a16z investing like building

604
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
their own century like brand

605
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,799
media channel and distribution with sub

606
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,400
sac and now like clubhouse and the good

607
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
times show

608
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
having musk on and zuckerberg and beat

609
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
mr beast yesterday

610
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,200
it's incredible to look at where some of

611
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,559
this trajectory can go in there's a sea

612
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,280
change going on

613
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,240
i think you're going to see more and

614
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,720
more interest in the expertise of

615
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,840
community building

616
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,679
and and the strategic importance at the

617
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,679
sea level which i think is necessary

618
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,640
awesome amazing uh that was a pretty

619
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,840
sweet summary here

620
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,360
and it gave me a lot of new ideas but

621
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,520
that actually is all the time we have

622
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,720
gentlemen uh

623
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,559
thank you so much for having a

624
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
conversation

625
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,280
around community and i

626
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,600
hope to see you guys around soon and

627
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,199
stay curious
