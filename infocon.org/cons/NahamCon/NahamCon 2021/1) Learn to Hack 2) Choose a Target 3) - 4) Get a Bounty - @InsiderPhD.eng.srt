00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,960
hello everyone my name is katie also

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,960
known as insider phd

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,320
um welcome to naham con uh

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,440
my presentation today is learn to hack

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,559
choose a target something

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,680
hack i guess get a bounty and this is

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,039
really gonna be a

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,520
whirlwind tour around a bunch of issues

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,439
in bug bounties or what i think are

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,480
issues

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
um and how i think that you can learn

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,320
how to do bug bounties like right now

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
no special requirements at all in case

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,120
you don't know who i am my name is katie

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,800
i'm also known as insider phd i run a

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,840
youtube channel

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
where i teach people just like you how

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,440
to learn how to get into bug bounties

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,840
and web applications hacking more

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,039
generally so

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,879
the basic recipe and this is what i tell

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,480
people um

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
to learn how to hack is to learn to hack

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,440
to then choose your program to hack i

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
guess however you do that

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,280
and then you get your bounty and it's

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
kind of presented in these steps

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,359
and we hack we find bugs we write report

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,799
we move on

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,080
but i don't really think it's that

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
simple and i don't think anybody else

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,680
thinks it's that simple either

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,760
bug bounty's changed adapt over time and

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
what even i may have learned last year

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,119
is not necessarily going to be relevant

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,000
for you

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
the people who learned five years ago

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,680
it's not necessarily relevant for you

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,200
and i think actually the landscape has

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,799
really changed um

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
because really we have all these other

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
questions we have mentorships

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
automation private versus public

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,079
um checklists methodologies are all the

45
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
bugs gone when do i give up how do i

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,960
take notes how to test the

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,000
vulnerabilities

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,159
how people can even find bugs when pros

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,360
find so many

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,799
and this is kind of what i'm going to

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,960
address today it's like these three

52
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,560
issues

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
and really how i think you can learn how

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,799
to do bug mounties

55
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,000
um this year so let's look at the first

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,320
one

57
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,240
learn to hack this is the fundamentals

58
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,399
to consider when you're learning to hack

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,640
um where should i learn from so the

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
first advice i always give is whatever

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,680
works best for you there is absolutely

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,280
no right answer there is no

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,719
magic spell there's no pill there's no

64
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,399
like course there's no money you can pay

65
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,520
to just become good at bug bounties um

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
and there is just no right answer what

67
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,120
will work for me won't necessarily work

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,319
for you it won't necessarily work for

69
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,520
your friends

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
but i like this idea of this learning

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
pyramid it's completely debunked

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,280
no scientific evidence behind it before

73
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
the idea is

74
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,160
to have this kind of variation you know

75
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
if you just watch something you don't

76
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,920
really retain a lot of the information

77
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,640
but if you see a demonstration if you

78
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,560
practice it if you teach others you then

79
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
retain more

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
um answering that works for me really

81
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,360
well is write-ups so i really like

82
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
reading write-ups i really like

83
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,000
digesting them

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
um and i really like to present them on

85
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
my videos and that's really useful for

86
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,560
me

87
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,800
because um i learn a lot by practicing

88
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
and then by teaching others

89
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,680
so what i think is the best thing to do

90
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120
is really to get some variety like

91
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
choose a bunch of different ones

92
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
immerse yourself in hacking and that can

93
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
really be a huge

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,080
advantage keep up with the news like on

95
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,400
twitter via newsletters

96
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,560
um you know just put yourself in a

97
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
position where

98
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
you don't necessarily have to eat sleep

99
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
breathe bug bounties

100
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,239
just make sure you are kind of exposed

101
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:18,879
to it

102
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
regularly um and the next piece of

103
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,200
advice i can really give is take

104
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
effective notes as you learn

105
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,560
effective is going to completely depend

106
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
on you like there is no

107
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,799
correct way for taking notes um but you

108
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,080
should take notes

109
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,159
because when you take notes you will

110
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
remember more a hundred percent

111
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,879
no really don't have to be detailed just

112
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,640
enough so you can remember them

113
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,080
so you might be thinking okay if they

114
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,239
don't have to be detailed

115
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,480
what should i actually capture and i

116
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,239
think what you should capture is signs

117
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,959
um and i say this a lot so what really

118
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,879
separates pro bug bounty hunters from

119
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,560
new bug bounty hunters is that new

120
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
hackers learn one bug

121
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
and then look for that everywhere and

122
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,400
that really gives you a disadvantage

123
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
because you can be looking at a bug

124
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
straight in your face and completely be

125
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
unaware of it

126
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,319
so what i think the best way to kind of

127
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,000
get around this is is to learn the signs

128
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
of more than one bug

129
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,360
even if it's just three or four you know

130
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,959
versus learning one bug and learning

131
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
like four well you've

132
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
you've got your chances up by four there

133
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
so whenever you read watch listen

134
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,440
however you absorb your information

135
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
ask yourself questions like how they not

136
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,560
to look for

137
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,520
why did they try that um one example is

138
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,919
you know

139
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,720
every idol usually revolves around id so

140
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
now as a hacker as soon as i see an id

141
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,440
i'm constantly checking for eye doors if

142
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,360
i see reflected input i'm thinking

143
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,720
cross-site scripting i'm terrible at

144
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
cross-site scripting

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
but i would be thinking it and that's i

146
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,080
think what you kind of need to get out

147
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,600
of your notes is getting those signs

148
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,520
really quickly

149
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,360
um but then you might be thinking but i

150
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,840
won't know how to exploit it

151
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
so really what your note should do is

152
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
help you become familiar with a few bugs

153
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
but you still need to be able to recall

154
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,720
it my advice is to go broad with your

155
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,199
knowledge

156
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,880
grow broad with your notes and go deep

157
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
when you need to exploit only when you

158
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,680
actually find yourself needing to

159
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,720
exploit

160
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,400
so always make sure to record where the

161
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
information came from right you know

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,840
even if it's just a link to a blog post

163
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,800
right

164
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,639
notes are good for simplifying helping

165
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,000
you remember

166
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
if you have loads of complex technical

167
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,199
information in your notes they're just

168
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,680
not going to work for you anyway

169
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
so what should i take my notes in so i

170
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,360
did a poll on twitter

171
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,919
um and i had people face off against

172
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,600
different note-taking apps

173
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,840
but honestly whatever you like it's

174
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,600
completely up to you if you like a

175
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
specific method a system piece of

176
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,400
software

177
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,240
just keep it there's no point changing

178
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,800
it um i really like notion and i also

179
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,639
have a lot of handwritten notes but you

180
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,240
might not like notion and you might not

181
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,680
like handwriting your notes

182
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
and that's fine um i did my poll and

183
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
obsidian was voted

184
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
as the one people most liked um

185
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,039
with notion as a second with vim as the

186
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,639
community choice which really shows you

187
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,440
know

188
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
there are very broad um like categories

189
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,840
here there's no like

190
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,720
one application and you can just write

191
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
notes in a text file it really doesn't

192
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,919
have to be complicated you just need a

193
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,319
way to recall them later

194
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
so what do i think the goal is i think

195
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,080
the goal is what you might think is a

196
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,880
knowledge map

197
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
and a knowledge base a way you can kind

198
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,600
of go

199
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,240
vulnerability i s i will look for xss

200
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,479
and in the xss category you have

201
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,199
a bunch of reports on xss maybe a bunch

202
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
of blog posts bunch of different types

203
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,199
maybe you have it split up into

204
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,960
dom and reflected and stored right

205
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,720
maybe you have it so it's completely

206
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
separate and you can kind of search what

207
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,360
you want then

208
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,039
you want to build up a knowledge base

209
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,400
you want to build up something that's

210
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,880
unique to you that you know how to use

211
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
um and then when you hack and when you

212
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
sort of see oh yeah that's the sign of

213
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,160
that one bug

214
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,759
you can just go into your knowledge base

215
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,280
scroll down find

216
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,720
the resources that you think will be

217
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,880
most appropriate and try and replicate

218
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,560
their exploits a lot of people ask when

219
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
are you done learning like when do you

220
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
when are you done and the answer is

221
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
never the best hackers are learning all

222
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,280
the time

223
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,080
nobody ever goes yes i am the ultimate

224
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,440
ruler of uh

225
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
bug bounties i now know everything um

226
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
literally no hacker will tell you that

227
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,319
because everyone is always trying to

228
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,400
like learn and improve they're always

229
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,599
reading they're always trying to improve

230
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,960
their practice they're working with

231
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,039
others trying to understand them

232
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,479
but then you might be thinking so when

233
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,080
am i ready to move on

234
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,840
and the answer is right now like there

235
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
is no critical mass of knowledge you

236
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,319
need

237
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,280
to get started in bug bounties i promise

238
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
you you're good enough there is no

239
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
like doing something else is not gonna

240
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
be the thing that lets you get uh

241
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,720
bounties right it is just you've got it

242
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
now just

243
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,800
roll with it so that was my kind of

244
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,919
learned hack section

245
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,840
it's all about choosing a program and

246
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
you know how do you choose a program

247
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
when you don't really know what you're

248
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,360
doing

249
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,039
um so let's talk about bug bounty

250
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,960
platforms so if you're not really sure

251
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,479
what a bug badge platform are they're

252
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,400
third parties which host bug bounty

253
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,520
programs

254
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,919
so programs are things you can hack a

255
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,919
platform hosts them

256
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,360
and they kind of let you hack a

257
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,199
different range of companies

258
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,039
they do things like coordinate payments

259
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,639
help manage programs they may also

260
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,120
provide triage services invite only

261
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
um it really doesn't matter which

262
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
blockbuster platform you go to

263
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,680
all of them are good um you might want

264
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,720
to pick one

265
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,919
based on what we'll talk about a bit

266
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,559
later but there's no wrong answer there

267
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,240
and you might be thinking from that well

268
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,839
don't all the pros have all the bugs

269
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,880
anyway

270
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
um and like you know you can never find

271
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,240
a bug

272
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,559
and i will promise you as a beginner you

273
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
will find bugs that pros don't

274
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,399
not every bug can be automated or will

275
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,480
be automated some bugs

276
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,120
pros don't exploit when they find it um

277
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
because they're focused on kind of more

278
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,240
critical issues and

279
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
fundamentally it doesn't matter what

280
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
program or platform we choose

281
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,440
we can always turn the tide in our favor

282
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,240
so a big platform or a small platform it

283
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
really doesn't matter

284
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
um we just need to be hacking on a

285
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,040
program um

286
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,240
which we can kind of see

287
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
people have um

288
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,480
seen so what we want to see sounds

289
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,200
really weird

290
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,279
um what we really want to do is look at

291
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,640
programs which people haven't had to

292
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,440
look at yet

293
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
and try and get as fresh as possible um

294
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
this could be a public program

295
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,440
it could be a smaller um like

296
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
platform it could be a nisha platform it

297
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,760
could be a private program and a large

298
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,040
platform or just a program that has

299
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,160
regular updates

300
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
we really want to see new stuff we want

301
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,080
to see new assets you want to see things

302
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,600
haven't been touched before

303
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
because that will improve our chances

304
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,279
and i say that but bounty

305
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
is like a mixture between luck and skill

306
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,480
and this is how we turn the tide of luck

307
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
in our favor so public versus private if

308
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,959
you're really worried go for a private

309
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,839
program

310
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,600
look for programs with a low total

311
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,519
bounties paid which suggests in your

312
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,320
program

313
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,079
but that have a good response time

314
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,440
especially time to bounty because that

315
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,000
means it's an

316
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
active program um what industry

317
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,160
specifically

318
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,480
i always say any if you have an option

319
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
to hack an app you already

320
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,720
kind of know definitely hack that

321
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,600
because

322
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
those tend to be things where you know

323
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,800
them quite well already you know what

324
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,560
some of the functionality is

325
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
so you'll be more more an advantage

326
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,760
basically

327
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
but there are certain programs that are

328
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,120
always going to be better for low

329
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,200
competition bug bounty hunting

330
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
like for example mobile apps trust me

331
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
nobody touches

332
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
mobile apps it's harder it's more of a

333
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,959
pain to get set up

334
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,200
and because of that less people do it

335
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,040
android is popular

336
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,640
and easy to set up you can entire an

337
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,279
emulator less people do ios

338
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,120
overall you need an ios device unless

339
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
you have one of the new macbooks

340
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
but fundamentally um mobile apps are the

341
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,240
place to go if you want to learn kind of

342
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,959
niche skills

343
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,240
okay so then we've kind of covered like

344
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,800
programs we've covered learning to hack

345
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,240
how do we actually hack anyway like how

346
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,440
how do you how do you hack like how do

347
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
you actually do that so let's have a

348
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,959
chat about actually hacking something

349
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,600
hacking is partly luck to find a bug you

350
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,560
need the combination of luck and skill

351
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
now when you first start out this might

352
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,920
be like 80

353
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,200
20 skill but as you improve your skill

354
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
luck is less of a factor and what the

355
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,600
pros have done to kind of tilt that even

356
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,880
more in their favor is they have

357
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,480
specialities

358
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,040
like that's how hackers get the

359
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,519
consistency

360
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
um they have the consistency the

361
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,640
knowledge and the experience to flip

362
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
that around and make it so

363
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
um skill is far more in their favor but

364
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,760
when you first start out luck will

365
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
definitely be

366
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,120
um an aspect of whether or not you find

367
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
a bug

368
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,519
and that's important to recognize um and

369
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,000
you shouldn't

370
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,959
feel bad if you can't find a bug because

371
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,279
it is challenging

372
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,279
and the most difficult part of hacking

373
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,639
is well

374
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,600
hacking stuff um packing is different

375
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
for different people like learning the

376
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,120
way people hack is differently

377
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,760
um there's tweet posts that get kind of

378
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,399
spread around

379
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,839
it's like how did you find your first

380
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,240
bug and you know i found my first bug

381
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
like kind of randomly i found it i was

382
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,279
very

383
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,480
very fortunate and this is

384
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
when we can use it to our advantage

385
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,920
because we have mentorship and

386
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,360
collaboration

387
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
it's challenging we have a large

388
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,360
community like there are so many other

389
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
people and you'll see them in the chat

390
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
now literally talking

391
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
we have such a large community that we

392
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,639
can make those connections with each

393
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,720
other we have the ability

394
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,399
to collaborate to listen to

395
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,480
join together and we can meet other

396
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,680
hackers

397
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,480
use this join communities like nahomi's

398
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,279
right

399
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,360
talk to people it's fantastic for

400
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
learning because not only will you see

401
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,120
how different people hack

402
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,440
you'll also see how different people

403
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,680
learn and what different resources get

404
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,360
shared

405
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,120
and being part of a community is such a

406
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
big advantage especially when it comes

407
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,760
to

408
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,839
um you as a more established hacker as

409
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,120
you improve

410
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
you'll see oh i already have a bunch of

411
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,399
hacking friends i can ask if they want

412
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,320
to collab with me right it's not a case

413
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,200
of

414
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
i'm completely on my own because you're

415
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,639
not

416
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,639
now a lot of people like to use other

417
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
people's methodologies

418
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,600
and i think this is a difficult subject

419
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,800
i don't think

420
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
other people's methodologies will work

421
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
for you unless you adapt to it

422
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,519
some people are very recon heavy like

423
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,079
nahamsek he is very recon heavy and he

424
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,920
finds bugs with his recon

425
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,160
and some people don't really like recon

426
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
and you know what you'll figure out what

427
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,519
works for you in time it takes

428
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,160
experience

429
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,680
it takes like um learning it takes like

430
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,519
actually hacking something and getting

431
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,720
that kind of

432
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
oh actually i don't really like doing

433
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
this this is kind of boring

434
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,519
and on the subject of recon i think this

435
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,279
is a difficult subject because i think a

436
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,000
lot of people

437
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,120
think oh recon is how i get bugs

438
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,959
when you do recon you really need to do

439
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,880
it thoughtfully you need to be thinking

440
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,120
you know what am i trying to accomplish

441
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
and from that are you trying to

442
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,639
understand the whole attack surface

443
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,320
are you looking for hidden endpoints on

444
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,079
functionality are you looking for like

445
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,680
pure information disclosure file

446
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,959
disclosure

447
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,120
and always think about that goal like

448
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
what you're going to do next a lot of

449
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,639
people will run recon and then they

450
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,320
don't necessarily know what the next

451
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,639
step

452
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
is for them so really think before you

453
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,279
do something like recon what you

454
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,639
actually need it for and what you're

455
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,399
actually going to do with it afterwards

456
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,399
and how are you going to use it

457
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,079
um and that will really help when it

458
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,760
comes to actually using it effectively

459
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,720
you know whether that's taking

460
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,920
screenshots

461
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,079
whether that is oh i want to look for

462
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,760
javascript files

463
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,000
all of that is best done by recon but

464
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,880
you have to know what you want first

465
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,959
and on the subject automation so

466
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,600
automation is really trendy right now

467
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
um and i'm sure you have all heard of

468
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,839
nuclear at this point

469
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,399
um i will say that relying on automation

470
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,160
alone is unlikely to get you a bounty

471
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,000
it's more likely to get you a dupe

472
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,440
a lot of these tools are available for

473
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,199
everybody now and

474
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,519
what i think is important is to learn

475
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,480
manual testing

476
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,199
first and then figure out how tools fit

477
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
with your methodology

478
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,000
so for an example as an example i hack a

479
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
lot of apis one of my major issues

480
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,279
i have when hacking apis is finding

481
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,639
additional endpoints

482
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,800
so one tool that kind of solves that

483
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
problem

484
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,959
is um ffuf so

485
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,639
i use that as a fuzzer so i haven't just

486
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,320
used that because it's on trend right

487
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
now i use it because i had a specific

488
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,519
problem i needed to solve

489
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,040
that couldn't be solved with manual

490
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,800
testing

491
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,519
and my kind of number one piece of

492
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,040
advice for all hacking

493
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,360
is to hack what you can see focus on

494
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,880
functionality first

495
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,040
if you see a log on screen you need to

496
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,720
be testing for like account takeovers

497
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
can you reset the password

498
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
if you see e-commerce you should be

499
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
thinking about pricing issues

500
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,600
if you see a comment system you should

501
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,360
be thinking about xss

502
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,680
any kind of like deleting permissions um

503
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,880
creating permissions you should be

504
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
thinking about idols

505
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,639
hack the functionality that you can see

506
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,800
don't get obsessed with like

507
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,199
where rce's are that will come in time

508
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,160
when you get

509
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,360
more experience and you kind of

510
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,920
understand better what you like to hack

511
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
for the moment focus on what you can see

512
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
and how you can break what you see

513
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
and that is the best way to actually get

514
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,399
started

515
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,320
and you're probably thinking from this

516
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,600
how do you actually know when you found

517
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,480
a bug

518
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
and that seems like a really simple

519
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,399
question but it's kind of a complex

520
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,079
answer right how do we actually know if

521
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,079
some things are vulnerable

522
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,680
well what we look for is bug bounty

523
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
hunters is impact and what is impact

524
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,759
impact has some kind of effect on the

525
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,680
security of an organization

526
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,160
even non-technical bugs can be impactful

527
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,079
and complex technical bugs not impactful

528
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:58,880
at all

529
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,079
um for example i i know that

530
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,160
um my mentee mentor uh sarah she

531
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,880
had found a vulnerability um and it was

532
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,599
like

533
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
rc so you're thinking top level apart

534
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,520
from was a sandboxed environment

535
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,280
which she'd gone like the difficult

536
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,959
route to find a bug on

537
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,119
and equally you know one of my best bugs

538
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,119
is not something that has like

539
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,799
really complicated it's a very simple

540
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,079
idol but with a really impactful effect

541
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,880
and that's what makes bugs like unique

542
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,559
so

543
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,160
so we found something how do we actually

544
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
get paid how do we do that get a bounty

545
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,039
part

546
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,280
so how do you know if you've got impact

547
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
um the easiest thing to do is to ask

548
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,480
yourself some questions

549
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
does this affect the organization's data

550
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,320
or intellectual property

551
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,720
does it affect the users of a product is

552
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,559
this likely to affect the reputation of

553
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,840
an organization

554
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,120
and kind of more generally would a

555
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,720
malicious actor be interested in what

556
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,440
you found

557
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,919
as bug bounty hunters we play malicious

558
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,960
actors right

559
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,960
we play the scary hacker in the basement

560
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,480
with all the lights turned off in a

561
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,200
black hoodie um and what we need to do

562
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,080
is scare

563
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,120
a business into paying us money um

564
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,559
not to like say oh look if you don't do

565
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
this i'll hack your systems

566
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,720
but to say hey look this is a really

567
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,320
serious issue that you need to address

568
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,919
right now

569
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,840
and with impact we need to constantly

570
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,360
link it back up to what the business

571
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,080
is and what it does we want to put like

572
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,440
our findings into

573
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,400
their language so what does this mean so

574
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
let's say you find an idol an e-commerce

575
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,039
platform

576
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,039
the idol allows you to cancel an order

577
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,400
without being logged in

578
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,919
what does this mean for the organization

579
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,440
that you're hacking well

580
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
we can go ahead and say a malicious

581
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
actor could go ahead and cancel

582
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
everyone's orders without them knowing

583
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,160
this links back to what the organization

584
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,679
does we're not using the term

585
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,000
idol while we might give technical

586
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,440
details when we talk about

587
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,039
impact we kind of want to talk more

588
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,960
generally

589
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,000
um it's kind of thinking about

590
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,840
how would you make that case to somebody

591
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,440
who maybe isn't technical

592
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,039
linking it back to what the business

593
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,840
does is really vital

594
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,559
so why does impact matter well impact

595
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,760
tells you you found something

596
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,400
interesting and a core idea you

597
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
structure a report around

598
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
bug bounty platforms aren't actually

599
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
there to throw money at you they want to

600
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,320
protect their

601
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
customers reputations organizations and

602
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
data from malicious

603
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,559
hackers now if we look at the photo the

604
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,640
issue there is a plane crash right

605
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,360
like that is not kind of that not that

606
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,320
obvious

607
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,080
but we need to be thinking what is the

608
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
impact that that could have so

609
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,240
somebody could die um there could be a

610
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,120
fire the home could be damaged

611
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,039
we might see something even kind of

612
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,960
greater you know what if

613
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,480
they can't control the blaze that could

614
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,080
cause a forest fire

615
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,160
and that's how we need to be thinking

616
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,320
about our vulnerabilities is like okay

617
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,880
what could this do if left unchecked why

618
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,360
do they need to care about this

619
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,080
and that's how you get bugs triaged well

620
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,440
and even if you know you're not that

621
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,000
great at english if you just have a go

622
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
most organizations will work with you to

623
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
kind of understand that impact not

624
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
against you

625
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,480
so what makes a good report this is i

626
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,120
think the

627
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,159
fifth the five most important ones first

628
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:14,559
is

629
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,799
clear concise writing if you're not a

630
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,840
native speaker

631
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
try your best and get a friend to give

632
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,600
your writing a second look

633
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
um it could be a really good advice

634
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000
because i'm dyslexic

635
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
is to to put your writing into google

636
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,039
translate

637
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,799
uh put it into english and then listen

638
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,600
to it and then say oh okay

639
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,799
um i can kind of see what sounds clunky

640
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,760
the other thing

641
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,280
is a lot of um bug bounty programs might

642
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,799
actually support your language

643
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
um i think microsoft has a really wide

644
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
range of languages it supports

645
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,720
and if it would be better to be in your

646
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,919
native language then

647
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,360
write it in that if you can write clear

648
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
and concisely that's the important part

649
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,159
uh second is you need to explain the

650
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,400
vulnerability on their terms not on your

651
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,880
terms how does it affect their users

652
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,240
and that's i think what a lot of people

653
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,559
get wrong is they kind of think about

654
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,440
vulnerabilities in a kind of a weird

655
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,840
kind of hacker way when actually we need

656
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,720
to put that into a business perspective

657
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,240
um three are clear pocs right making

658
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,159
sure those steps are really clear

659
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,640
making sure that you know people can

660
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,440
understand it follow those steps

661
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,240
um bonus points for things like videos

662
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
one click exploits those things that

663
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,120
just make a trial just

664
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,760
job just a little bit easier and talk

665
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
about triages

666
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,280
four is be polite being rude and yelling

667
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,720
at them won't help your bug be

668
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
triaged faster right just be

669
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,480
professional

670
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
um fifth is don't make assumptions like

671
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,039
don't make assumptions that your triager

672
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,880
kind of knows everything about an asset

673
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,799
or what it does or that they even know

674
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,559
every bug in existence what's great

675
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,080
about bug bounty hunting is actually we

676
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,360
can learn from each other

677
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,960
both triager to hacker and from hacker

678
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,919
to triager

679
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,760
and actually you might know more about

680
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,960
an asset than the triage

681
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,120
does initially um because you've been

682
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,799
