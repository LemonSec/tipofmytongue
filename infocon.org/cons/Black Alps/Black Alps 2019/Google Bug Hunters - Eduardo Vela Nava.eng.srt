1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:08,148
so hi my name is Eduardo Vela I am going

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,269
to be talking about Google book hunters

3
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:12,739
which is the way we call people that

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:14,150
find security vulnerabilities in Google

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,660
products

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,869
my nickname is heard are cut and I

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,270
before I joined Google I was doing the

8
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:25,160
same thing I was reporting box to Google

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,290
products mostly because I thought it was

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,630
a difficult challenge and because it was

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,598
fun and when I found one by accident I

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,640
got hooked and I kept on doing it at

13
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,860
that time Google was not paying for bugs

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,090
so I was just doing it for fun what I

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,080
got a t-shirt that looked very similar

16
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:45,680
to this one and it was cool since then

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,360
now now after I joined and one year

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,480
after more or less I joined there has

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,710
been we have had the VRP they would not

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,809
really reward program where we pay

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:58,610
people for it they this is our logo we

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:02,060
don't actually have a logo we just saw

23
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,440
this picture on the one app on one of

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,009
the internal slide decks and we thought

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,740
it was cool

26
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,930
so we appropriated it we added the three

27
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,740
things in the side like the colors over

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,830
there can I do that

29
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:17,149
yes and then we said it was ours but

30
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,340
yeah anyway so I've been in Google for

31
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,710
around 10 years but the VRP only has

32
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,720
been around for a long now nine we are

33
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,330
not the longest-running one Mozilla has

34
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,570
been running significantly faster than

35
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:32,240
us and in terms of you just generally

36
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,048
bug bounties there's another one which

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,429
is Knuth had a bounty of like very

38
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,350
little month money for everyone that

39
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,869
could find the problem in his books so

40
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,330
we are not the longest-running one but

41
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:45,080
we have been running for a long time and

42
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,509
one of the things that has happened

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,090
since then is that our program is one of

44
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,850
the ones that has been running for a

45
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,380
long time that hasn't changed that much

46
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:59,869
internally like compared to like

47
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:03,048
Microsoft or Facebook and so on we we've

48
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:08,299
been growing in the same I don't know

49
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:11,900
theme to say to say which we think it's

50
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:14,629
interesting mostly because we have been

51
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,260
lucky enough to make some choices that

52
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:19,200
have allowed us to grow

53
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,070
consistently for several years with

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,030
process 60,000 whenever it is since then

55
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,859
that doesn't mean that we've paid for

56
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,640
all of them many of them are very very

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,400
low risk so we just don't pay for them

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,730
we've paid for 10,000 of them which is

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,760
roughly around $1,000 per reward this is

60
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,709
not exactly this is not completely true

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,780
as I will explain in like a second but

62
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,190
this is roughly the case one thing that

63
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,560
is worth mentioning is that chrome and

64
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,100
Android also have a reward program which

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,560
we operate independently of them which

66
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,780
means that eight million dollars is what

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,760
our program has paid but chrome on

68
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,590
Android together with us have paid

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,720
fifteen million dollars and this year

70
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,340
we're going to pay - yes for Google and

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,210
probably another - for chrome on Android

72
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,240
together so like 50 percent increase in

73
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,010
the last year this presentation is

74
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,620
called Google bug hunters because I will

75
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,359
be talking about bug hunters there's

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,550
also going to be things talking about

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,320
our process and things like that but

78
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,740
mostly I want to talk about bucks that

79
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,870
auerbach hunters found and like kind of

80
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,520
introduce them to you his name is Thomas

81
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,350
with yarski he has been reporting back

82
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,380
to Google for around five years and he

83
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,390
is the top earner let's say for the

84
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,040
Google beer P he mostly report success s

85
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,899
but also called execution and so on

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,079
every once in a while and he's really

87
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,570
like for him everything is easy so we

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,800
just met him like last week and he was

89
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,930
just making a presentation about a

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,510
hundred xs/s he found which are worth

91
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,310
around half a million dollars and he was

92
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,049
just saying like this is so easy and he

93
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,280
was going through his lights easy right

94
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,870
easy easy

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,640
so he's right he's very funny and we

96
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,180
meet him every once in a while but every

97
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,089
time we do is very fun experience the

98
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,850
other one this is a implement his name

99
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:13,380
is secret so I will not take his actual

100
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:17,130
name but he is also very good for this

101
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,190
year he is the top Bach hunter and he

102
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,108
mostly finds logic out by past issues

103
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,660
like largest business logic problems

104
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,250
like we forget to do access control

105
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,320
checks properly somewhere and so on and

106
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,910
one of the things to note about these

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,280
tuba contours is that this is

108
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,310
like very very tedious repetitive work

109
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,890
and they they spend a lot of time doing

110
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,060
this and they find amazing things just

111
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,909
because of the amount of patience they

112
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,830
have we we try to do the same thing we

113
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,780
try to automate it but we are not able

114
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:52,380
to be as effective as there so those are

115
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,880
the bug hunters now this is this is not

116
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,140
these are not work hunters The

117
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,890
Raconteurs were the ones in the previous

118
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:02,010
lights this is a whale feces researcher

119
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,620
and those guys were there are elephants

120
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,830
vasectomies do you know what they have

121
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,830
in common

122
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:15,150
anyone has heard this reference before

123
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:20,990
so they called the third and fifth worst

124
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:24,390
jobs in science the third is the whale

125
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,060
feces researcher and the fifth are the

126
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,860
elephant's with Septimus --ts the fourth

127
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,850
according to the science magazine in

128
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:37,080
2007 was our job in our except from

129
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:39,240
Microsoft so this what is it called the

130
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,060
popular science magazine called the

131
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,730
Microsoft security grant or what we

132
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,790
equate to our team in my in Google as

133
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,290
the worst jobs in science and it was

134
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,810
kind of interesting when I saw this

135
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,950
light this is from Kate emissaries and I

136
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,110
thought it was hilarious

137
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,729
but also I kind of knew kind of why but

138
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,160
then I was like wow like it must be

139
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:04,470
worse for them so we we have also

140
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,900
full-time roles fulfilling this but we

141
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,580
actually don't have that that problem

142
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,310
like we don't consider our job that it

143
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,510
sucks and I was one of these present the

144
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,270
main purpose of this presentation is to

145
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:20,810
figure out what made it so that we don't

146
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:24,240
hate it and and the TLDR is here that we

147
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,800
well now you guys have to see the whole

148
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,500
thing

149
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,240
so we receive an 800 upon elite report

150
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,190
monthly that is valid to narrative

151
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,410
reports that doesn't mean that all of

152
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,969
owner abilities are serious but is yes

153
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,130
it does mean that there's something that

154
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:41,190
we investigate and something is working

155
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,140
from in some confusing way after three

156
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,469
as many of them are duplicates or not

157
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,190
zero

158
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,690
or whatever so we will pay for all of

159
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,840
them this essentially means that we have

160
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:56,790
35 vulnerability reports every day every

161
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,109
time every day we work which means it

162
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,840
will be interesting to see how many

163
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,540
people do you think it will take to to

164
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,780
manage this in practice up to very

165
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,860
recently it was one person so how to

166
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,809
avoid burnout so the way that we do it

167
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,010
for one person I'll explain what one

168
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,450
person means because now it's kind of

169
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:20,130
two but it's complicated so the first

170
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,190
thing we do to make this with one person

171
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,380
is we have a rotation and that's with

172
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,890
twelve people so there is 12 people in a

173
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,140
rotation going once each and the reason

174
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,270
that we need 12 people we have tried

175
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,760
with less and we have tried with more we

176
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,099
tried with 30 at some point and 30 is

177
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,400
terrible you shouldn't do 30 30 because

178
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,020
nobody nobody remembers how to do it and

179
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,929
everyone is super inconsistent and we

180
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,630
tried with ached and it's like the well

181
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,680
vasectomies guy so not don't do that

182
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,110
either

183
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,690
it is 2/12 time commitments which means

184
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,490
before it was 1:12 now we have to 12 so

185
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,770
that means before we only had one person

186
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,130
at any point in time now we have body

187
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:09,060
teams so yeah

188
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,980
the body team part so before the way we

189
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,530
handle this was when you were in your

190
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,240
week you own the whole queue but that

191
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,950
had some issues when we had an incident

192
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,210
or something like that because if we had

193
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,969
something very serious it has to be done

194
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,890
right now you kind of drop in the floor

195
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,890
everything else so we created this body

196
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:30,030
system where the secondary we just take

197
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:32,699
some important things and then it has it

198
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,199
has evolved into a situation where the

199
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,390
primary supposed to spend as much time

200
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,580
as possible and whatever the extra work

201
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:43,199
there is the secondary works but we as a

202
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,580
secondary to be there as a backup some

203
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,370
people use the secondary differently I

204
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,490
use I am still in the rotation so I used

205
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,170
my secondaries mostly as a whenever

206
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,300
there's a bug that is too complicated to

207
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,250
reproduce I asked them to help but other

208
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,260
than that they don't have much to do

209
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,150
so the other thing that is important is

210
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,380
that we have a helpline so one thing

211
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,209
that is interesting is we have very

212
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,610
senior people doing rotation as well and

213
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,290
that part is important for us because

214
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,870
the more senior the people doing the

215
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,510
rotation the more confident they are on

216
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,610
their responses and the more confident

217
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,920
they are the less time they spend on it

218
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,430
which means that a senior person kind of

219
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:25,270
spend one hour to 335 reports let's say

220
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:27,400
but senior person can take many days for

221
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,260
the same for the same amount of work and

222
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,990
they this is just a matter of confidence

223
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,730
and this is another reason why we have

224
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,140
the they work in pairs because then we

225
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,480
can pair up a very senior person with a

226
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,920
very junior one this is useful and this

227
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,980
will help a lot because whenever we try

228
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,900
to put a different role in front either

229
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,080
someone on technical or someone just

230
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:51,280
learning they just blow up and go back

231
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,170
to the well vasectomies thing so one

232
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,459
thing that like is it's not in

233
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,560
proportional is this prayer is not

234
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,600
proportional they the seniority with the

235
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,459
junior thing is like way signe senior

236
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,589
people are significantly better at it

237
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,210
and if they don't have to be senior at

238
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:07,060
doing this job they just have to be very

239
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,380
confident on the things that they are on

240
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,689
the technology I know what they are

241
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,450
doing anyway everything we have is a

242
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,730
helpline we have a chat or a rope chat

243
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,750
where everyone asks questions and one of

244
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,430
the most important things that we found

245
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,200
out is that people don't use it unless

246
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,089
the senior people use it all the time so

247
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,920
the more senior people have to be using

248
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,550
it every time so that the other everyone

249
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,719
feels comfortable asking questions and

250
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,420
whenever we forget to use it for a

251
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,730
couple months we notice that the channel

252
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,310
goes that because nobody else uses it so

253
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,630
that that was interesting not using the

254
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,699
channel has been has made us very very

255
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:45,400
has made it so that they get buried they

256
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,710
get stuck very early and having senior

257
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,930
people use it has helped a lot and

258
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,750
templates one of the things that happens

259
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,979
is that not everybody our team there's a

260
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,250
lot of things that are specific to

261
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,410
Google that even if you are an expert in

262
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,540
things you will not know what the answer

263
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,810
is and you can ask in the helpline if

264
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,949
you want but the easiest way to do it is

265
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,170
to just have a template that is

266
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,760
essentially the knowledge base of our

267
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,990
team and we have like hundreds and

268
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,130
hundreds of templates

269
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,510
it's very easy to write the template

270
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,089
here at the response and then just click

271
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,709
Save and when people do search for the

272
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,990
templates they get to learn something

273
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:22,239
about that someone else previously did

274
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,830
so templates were also an interesting

275
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,360
learning just having something where

276
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,500
people can search for previous responses

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,649
was something that allowed people to

278
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,310
like not blow up so 12 people having 12

279
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:38,320
people if possible but it I understand

280
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,969
that not always absolutely working in

281
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,310
pairs having a helpline that senior

282
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,339
people use and having a templating

283
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,839
system that people use that people are

284
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,570
stiring responses all the time

285
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,410
has been has been the main way that we

286
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,070
didn't convert into well vasectomies

287
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,949
another thing that's interesting about

288
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,410
everything is that we have a lot of

289
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,959
people but they a lot of people base

290
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,469
their work on the results of the reward

291
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,849
program this helps a lot to justify the

292
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,350
existence of the program but also to

293
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,770
justify the existence of our team

294
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,240
so like privilege escalation Tomas with

295
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,730
yarski the guy I just presented the

296
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,920
beginning he found a way to get a code

297
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,870
execution in inter and some internal

298
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,860
Google things and that led to some

299
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,240
research about how that can we prevent

300
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,920
this from happening so this is a

301
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,170
privileged collation part of the thing

302
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,579
security mitigation sees how to make

303
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,290
exploitation vulnerabilities harder and

304
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:34,510
the way that they guide their work is

305
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,140
based on how how many vulnerabilities

306
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:40,329
report to the VRP are mitigated by their

307
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,730
technologies by CSP by sandboxing and

308
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,979
whatever code hardening the way that

309
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,560
they decide or they justify how much

310
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,089
time and effort they spent on hardening

311
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,829
certain types of products is based on

312
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,839
they will not reward program results and

313
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:54,160
are prosecuted to reviews the way that

314
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,110
we know whether we did a good job or not

315
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,980
is to see for the product that we do

316
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,870
secure through before

317
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,020
how many end up receiving external

318
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,399
product owner abilities so generally

319
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,800
speaking like the Security Response

320
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:09,940
effort doesn't feel but it definitely

321
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:13,870
helps the rest of our team justify and

322
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,579
do our work better another thing that

323
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,589
was interesting that we didn't do

324
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:20,469
properly before and we ended up learning

325
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:22,480
about it after some time was to separate

326
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,730
the money from the technical details and

327
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,190
this is something that many that this is

328
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,440
that very few other companies do for

329
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,029
whatever reason but this this is very

330
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,790
well this has been very important for us

331
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,709
so epic hunters when they report things

332
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,209
to Google we try to make them only

333
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,550
talked about the vulnerability technical

334
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,989
details and we tried and if they ask any

335
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,550
questions about the reward or anything

336
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,820
like that we tell them we don't know

337
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,319
this is about the panel and I don't know

338
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,089
tell me about the technical details and

339
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,860
the reason is because the person doing

340
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,320
that the triage we call them whoopsies

341
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,630
because our team is cool whoops

342
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,760
they is essentially trying to get

343
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,889
convinced by the external user that

344
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,970
there is a problem because once they are

345
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,190
convinced that there is a problem then

346
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,800
they have to convince a product team to

347
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,410
fix it so the person here in the middle

348
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,910
is just inter is essentially at first

349
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,139
representing Google to the back

350
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,670
continent and representing the book

351
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:15,160
hunter to the product team so we have

352
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,729
the same incentives in terms of like the

353
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,519
product team to get the bug fix so

354
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,290
whatever it is that they explained to us

355
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,079
in terms of risk we will pass into the

356
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,380
product in the however sometimes people

357
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,620
end up arguing endlessly about money and

358
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:35,350
by having the person here not have any

359
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,000
ability to control that at all then we

360
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,829
is easier for them to say like it's not

361
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,110
in my control sorry this is going to be

362
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:42,489
sent to the panel independently of that

363
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,620
and we have the panel which is a bunch

364
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,440
of people including me that I decide how

365
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,470
much money things get the people here

366
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,980
only review things one one week every 12

367
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,810
weeks

368
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,240
the people here review the same every

369
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,880
buck every week so people in the panel

370
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,769
are looking at every buck every week

371
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,290
this is like six to eight people

372
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:03,490
depending on the year looking at every

373
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,290
single bug that we received every year

374
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:11,160
every week surprisingly people here this

375
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:14,139
is a position that people want to be on

376
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,699
it is not a position that we force

377
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:17,800
people to be on or anything like that is

378
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:19,120
not even a volunteer-driven thing is

379
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,380
like we have to limit the amount of

380
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,000
people we have in the panel because if

381
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,620
you have too many people is hard to

382
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,240
manage and there is some people like it

383
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,250
is because all the box at this they see

384
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,290
are the valid box that were three

385
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:32,410
already buy them so they are very

386
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,599
interesting issues we did two weeks ago

387
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,160
we had around 75 issues that were in the

388
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,470
queue because we have leftovers or

389
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,469
people escalate and so on

390
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,260
so this position although it sounds kind

391
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,760
of awkward it is it is very fun like to

392
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,060
see all the issues that come in and out

393
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:53,650
they another interesting thing about

394
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:56,680
this is that people in the panel are not

395
00:15:53,650 --> 00:16:00,160
always so one of the things that happens

396
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,109
is that one bug hunters disagree about

397
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,430
the reward amount because we have all of

398
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,040
all of the things that we decide our

399
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,780
public like the criteria we use so when

400
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,719
we decided word amount and the back

401
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,939
country disagrees that means that we did

402
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,350
we don't understand the risk properly

403
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,970
because they we are using the

404
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,760
information that the product team and

405
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,520
the engineer told us to decide the

406
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,620
reward amount so if the bug hunter

407
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,960
disagrees with the reward amount then

408
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,090
that means that the impact is

409
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,430
misunderstood so we encourage very much

410
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,440
the bug hunters to argue for more money

411
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,449
because maybe we misunderstand the

412
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,970
reward amount we will misunderstand the

413
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,650
impact so if we don't if we get it wrong

414
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,060
then that means that we are not using

415
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:42,010
the severity properly so the bug bite

416
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,079
might not get fixed properly or might

417
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:46,360
not get fixed quick quick enough so by

418
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,460
arguing by asking them to argue forward

419
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,550
amounts we make sure that we get the

420
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:56,860
right the right impact and by separating

421
00:16:51,550 --> 00:17:00,400
the the the roles these doesn't burn out

422
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,650
the people in in in triage anyway this

423
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,389
worked out very well and it has helped

424
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,949
us catch issues that we didn't realize

425
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,620
where our series as they were until

426
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:11,230
later on when the bug hunters explained

427
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,149
us so sometimes in person like last week

428
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,310
we were in in London in event with the

429
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,470
bug hunters and we actually they

430
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,000
actually got to show us like that we

431
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,189
misunderstood something or something

432
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,689
like that in person and that is pretty

433
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:27,910
much like the ideal scenario for this so

434
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:28,960
yeah we also tried to whenever we

435
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,740
communicate about what hunting

436
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,480
externally we try to limit the amount of

437
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,700
ways we explain we talk about it as a

438
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,680
function of money because for many of

439
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,960
them especially people that are already

440
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,550
well paid in a normal job this is not

441
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,030
about the money alone this is just about

442
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:48,700
like cool research or about making

443
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,950
things safer and whatnot but whenever

444
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,230
you you focus all communications about

445
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,919
money then

446
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,200
ually innate and this has happened a lot

447
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,690
several times that we have famous

448
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,309
security researchers contact contact us

449
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,580
and when they see that our

450
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:08,280
communications used to be money related

451
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,770
they eventually their tone change very

452
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,780
quickly and when we change all of our

453
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,690
templates to not talk about money at all

454
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,149
you talk about the technical impact that

455
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,700
essentially attract that fixed those

456
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,190
type of relationships but it's very easy

457
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,340
to send away people that just want to

458
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,720
help you and don't care about the $5,000

459
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:33,540
you're going to give them because they

460
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,980
already have some money so one of the

461
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,220
other three ways that we manage to

462
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:41,340
attract and retain very senior people do

463
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:45,390
all of these work like the the panel and

464
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,649
the and the triage people is because the

465
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,419
way the way it works in Google is that

466
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,840
people kind of choose the type of things

467
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:54,299
they're interested in and you cannot

468
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,159
kind of force them to do anything so the

469
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:59,549
way that you convince them to stay doing

470
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,280
this work is with more reports so the

471
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:05,000
the the reason this is interesting is

472
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,700
because if you are three aging a lot of

473
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,700
invalid boring reports then it is very

474
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,080
easy to burn out but if you are three

475
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,290
urging very cool and interesting

476
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,020
challenging surprising problems and

477
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:21,799
vulnerabilities then rather than burning

478
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,330
out you get super interested in them so

479
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,210
we have invested a lot in education and

480
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:30,178
on ways of interacting with book hunters

481
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,280
to deliver better better reports mostly

482
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,840
as a justification for us to get better

483
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,740
reports so that people don't get burned

484
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,299
out so we created this these are the

485
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,590
three more interesting things one of

486
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:45,679
them is what country University which is

487
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:49,010
just a websites in which we teach people

488
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,570
the things are interested in one of the

489
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:54,540
before we had this so there is a lot of

490
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,909
people that are very very motivated and

491
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,970
keep on sending reports every day for

492
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,860
like months and when you see that when

493
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,280
we saw that some time ago like maybe

494
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,310
five years ago we were very very close

495
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,180
to

496
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:14,330
implementing something that deprioritize

497
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:17,060
their reports so that was essentially a

498
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,610
way of saying we do all of the reports

499
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,429
of this person are invalid so we don't

500
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:26,060
want to delay the response to everyone

501
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,500
else and we have an internal discussion

502
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,540
about it and we decided not to do that

503
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,470
and instead of doing that we just talk

504
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,790
to this to this bug hunter and we told

505
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,800
him what we were looking for

506
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,170
like we just spent some one-to-one time

507
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,020
with them and I mean not in person but

508
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,370
in in chat and it worked they stopped

509
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,400
sending all of the valid reports they

510
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:50,350
suddenly send us the good ones let's say

511
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,520
which were not that many but that worked

512
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,870
by some that we did but continued

513
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,460
versity in which we figured if we are

514
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,949
not telling people what we actually want

515
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,990
to get from them or we get very very

516
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,550
little information or we don't give them

517
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,500
technical information maybe we just tell

518
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,060
them generally this is the scope but we

519
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,150
don't give them why this is important

520
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,220
then essentially that leads to a lot of

521
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,410
noise and if we have a lot of noise we

522
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,670
burn out our security research hours our

523
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,560
engineers and if we burn out our

524
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,390
engineers nobody will want to do it so

525
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,480
we need it invest in education in order

526
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,580
to keep our staff happy anyway so

527
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,410
current university was just a website

528
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,080
where we have a bunch of stuff of the

529
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:29,030
things we're interested in form

530
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,460
submission of tips is something that we

531
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,649
do just before the report debauch to us

532
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,320
we do some roller expressions and based

533
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:38,450
on the things that they say we just show

534
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,429
them some information that this is

535
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,740
likely invalid or whatnot and this cut

536
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,850
the conversation close quickly because

537
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,730
when they send the report they already

538
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:50,570
know why it is invalid which has been

539
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:53,690
useful and lastly asking questions so I

540
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:56,000
went to nuke on four years ago Newton is

541
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,440
a conference in India and everyone from

542
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,770
Facebook Microsoft and Google got sick

543
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,360
after the conference but one of the

544
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,040
there are two things it was completely

545
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,840
worth it even though some of them went

546
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:10,820
to the hospital it they the reason it

547
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,639
was worth it is because III learned two

548
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,850
things in that in that in that

549
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,960
conference we gave a presentation kind

550
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,250
of similar to this but with more

551
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,510
vulnerabilities

552
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,220
and one one guy at the end came to me

553
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,450
and and as and told me I was on

554
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,370
interrupts I wasn't three as a week

555
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,560
before and we sign our name at the end

556
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,260
so everyone knows that I was the one

557
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,669
that reported so he came to me and we do

558
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,840
triage my blog last week and he was like

559
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:40,040
well what was it and it's like oh you

560
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,449
reacted it and I'm like why what what

561
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,800
was the buck like it was the first time

562
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,990
I met someone that I had to react to the

563
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,080
bug on so it was like an interesting

564
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,230
encounter and he told me oh it was a

565
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,639
quickie aking in whatever and it when

566
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,410
you are when we are in our computer we

567
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,690
had these templates we had these Bakken

568
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,820
University articles and stuff so we we

569
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,070
can just with a couple buttons we can

570
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,200
just send them a response answering

571
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,909
their question but this was the first

572
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,480
time that I didn't have this and I had

573
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,890
to interact with someone right so I

574
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,870
didn't know how I I was not going to

575
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:18,290
explain to them or to him the amount of

576
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:20,300
like how how he was wrong so I just

577
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,990
accidentally asked him why do you think

578
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:27,230
it's a bug and then I kind of dust his

579
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,310
brain because like essentially he he

580
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,860
realized he hasn't thought about that

581
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,240
part yet he just realized it was

582
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,270
clickjacking there was missing extra

583
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,010
Martians I should report this and when I

584
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,629
asked him why is this important or how

585
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,020
can you exploit this he hadn't thought

586
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,860
about that

587
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,620
which was an interesting insight because

588
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:48,260
nowadays when we have someone that is

589
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,689
very very enthusiastic we just ask them

590
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,100
to think about those things like why is

591
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,860
this a serious or how is this

592
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,060
explainable because they in some cases

593
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,850
they haven't thought about this before

594
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,860
and when once they think about it they

595
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,230
start reporting box where they can

596
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,990
answer those questions and then it's

597
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,090
less work for us at least and it's very

598
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,400
fast to ask one sent these questions

599
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,550
rather than the paragraphs that we had

600
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,460
to invest him before so that allows us

601
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,649
to scale a bit better another thing that

602
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,480
happened in that in that trip was that I

603
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:25,400
met this guy

604
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,530
Jasmin there so yes he's one of our top

605
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,270
100 condors

606
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,270
we have like thousands so that's still

607
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,190
very good and when I met him in person

608
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:38,720
he

609
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:41,930
I mean he he reports books valid more

610
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,990
often than not but he does he is not all

611
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:47,660
the time valid but when we asked him he

612
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,190
said that a hundred percent of his that

613
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,940
he has success rate of a hundred percent

614
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:56,660
and we didn't understand what that meant

615
00:24:52,940 --> 00:25:00,170
right which was interesting because the

616
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:02,690
way that he figure this is that whenever

617
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,240
he goes after a hunt which is a group of

618
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,220
products let's say and he finds

619
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,480
something out of the twenty reports he

620
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,730
sends he considers that the whole hunt

621
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,020
successful that essentially it's

622
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,340
completely different how we see it

623
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,930
because from our side we don't know when

624
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,610
they are in a hunt we're just in three

625
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:23,330
days wrong week and we are not able to

626
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:25,219
see them like do all these reports over

627
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,540
over several weeks so from our

628
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,950
perspective we can see a bunch of

629
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,649
invalid reports and every once in a

630
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,480
while one of them is valid so thinking

631
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:34,130
about this in this way helped us a lot

632
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,410
because then we created a program called

633
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:39,980
research runs in which we just give them

634
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,780
money ahead of time and if they find

635
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,090
something or not they still keep the

636
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,710
money and we only ask them to report the

637
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,379
bugs that are ballots and they get money

638
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,390
on top of the of the grant for every

639
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,210
ballot report do they send so there is

640
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,890
no incentive to send invalid reports we

641
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,180
give them like between five hundred to

642
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,700
three thousand dollars and they just

643
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,470
keep it and if they find more bugs

644
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,940
they get more money on top we don't ask

645
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,340
for a report at the end or anything like

646
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,300
that this is just like like we think

647
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,459
that they are going to invest some time

648
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,000
on this anyway and we want them to

649
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,710
invest on it in and and find something

650
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,580
so

651
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,330
thinking the way that he thought about

652
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,370
it actually the fact that he mentioned

653
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,280
that he goes on a hunt and that's how

654
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,750
he's used his time and we started asking

655
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,550
other countries if they did it that way

656
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,830
and they told us all of them they told

657
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,780
us yes then allowed us to create a

658
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,189
program that kind of aligned several

659
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,930
solve several problems at the same time

660
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,400
grants also solved the problem of

661
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,570
duplicates because he's not a waste of

662
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,000
time that you didn't that you find the

663
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,129
same bug with other people and starting

664
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,230
next year we are going to be doubling

665
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,960
reward amounts are that are found

666
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,030
between two people together if they find

667
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,659
them as part of a grant so

668
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:52,668
essentially like grants is a way to

669
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:56,570
structure the work a bit better and it

670
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:59,169
was all thanks to - yes like that one

671
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:01,250
conversation was like oh my god

672
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:02,390
one thing that is interesting is that we

673
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,610
have been giving grants for a long time

674
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,039
and the one of the things that we found

675
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,168
out that before we didn't know what what

676
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,049
is the success rate of hunters that

677
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:14,900
means how often when people go on a hunt

678
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:16,460
can they find something and we just

679
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,710
realized that it unless your tummy

680
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,770
además the first guy I talk to you about

681
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:24,679
that everything is easy your success

682
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:28,280
rate is in average 13.7 percent which is

683
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:31,330
great because it's almost 1 3 3 7 and we

684
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:34,789
were very happy when we found of them so

685
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:36,289
so they the the success rate 13.7

686
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:39,919
percent means that for every grant that

687
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:43,730
we give only 13.7 percent of those have

688
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:47,030
a result and the other 86.3% get nothing

689
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,799
and we still think this is a worth use

690
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,870
of our time because this is the risk

691
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,000
that our book hunters are taking like

692
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,070
when when is 10 of you go looking for

693
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,470
bugs in Google only one of you is going

694
00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:02,780
to succeed or 1.3 of you will succeed so

695
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,730
that's that was interesting for us to

696
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,350
find out and now we know over time

697
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,700
depending on we can slice it in

698
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,469
different ways we can see depending on

699
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,270
which product you go after depending on

700
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:16,190
which technology open who you are and so

701
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:19,100
on but yeah that that no number we

702
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:22,190
didn't have before another thing that

703
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,629
happened and this was thanks okay this

704
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,880
is escalate was an event that we had

705
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:27,860
last week in London we had three things

706
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,900
happening on it in eg which is a an

707
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,178
event with students we fly students

708
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,419
around Europe to London and we give them

709
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:37,280
some workshops box what we fly our topic

710
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:39,740
on tours from around the world to London

711
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,879
again and we have them give

712
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:48,590
presentations and CTF is just a Google

713
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:50,870
CTF finals and we have some you know CTF

714
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,199
chat tasks and we solve them or they

715
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:56,360
solve them we we build them

716
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,370
this is Venkatesh this is also his salsa

717
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,770
from India he's he's from the second

718
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:04,879
time I went to to know Khan

719
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:07,070
and Venkatesh reported some bugs in

720
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,620
Google Cloud shell yes you essentially

721
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:14,260
were able to get a shell injection in

722
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:16,729
Google clouds through a special URL and

723
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,050
it was a cool blog and everything and we

724
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,600
were having dinner the night before the

725
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:23,600
present we invited him to go to do an

726
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,740
old con to present his findings like we

727
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,939
essentially talking can you please come

728
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,770
to Newcomb we will tie for your flights

729
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,550
and everything and we want you to give a

730
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:34,610
presentation about your Google box and

731
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:36,200
he he said ok he prepared a presentation

732
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:39,080
we send it to us and then the night

733
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,990
before he told me hey I noticed that the

734
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,870
buggy still works so what's up with that

735
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,790
and we were like all really like yeah

736
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,959
but he got reported it to us like three

737
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,420
months before us on reddit

738
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,710
so we had plenty of time to fix it and I

739
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,990
checked internally and the other team

740
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:56,780
was were sitting on the Box still like

741
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,550
for whatever reason and so he asked if

742
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,870
he can still talk about it and yeah he

743
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,399
talked about it one of the interesting

744
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:05,330
things happen about talking about it in

745
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:08,660
a in an audience like that was that we

746
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,159
realized that actually it wasn't too bad

747
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,020
like people like the book wasn't that

748
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,480
serious the blog got fixed like the day

749
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:19,879
after and it was still like it was worth

750
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,140
him zero day awesome stage and if

751
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,200
happened a couple times afterwards as

752
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,790
well then I was keeping a secret so now

753
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,350
we have this other event called Escalade

754
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,149
which is the one in London and one of

755
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:32,570
them is box what were we allowed bug

756
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:34,340
hunters to talk about on patch zero days

757
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,629
with each other there is no zero day or

758
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,050
and if there is no in the air or

759
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:41,150
anything people we just trust them to to

760
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:43,909
do that properly and we also have the

761
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:46,490
CTF one interesting diversity F is that

762
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,710
we the way that we run it now is that we

763
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,500
train people do we train other Google

764
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,330
engineers to write challenges and there

765
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,490
is a way to do security advocacy around

766
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,600
the company we just teach them they

767
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,900
werner ability they are supposed to

768
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,169
write a challenge for and they write it

769
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,970
and burner ET write-ups many bug hunters

770
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:08,900
don't like talking about their bugs

771
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:10,760
so this is a book from the implement the

772
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,930
guy the second guy talked about and this

773
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,629
is the first time he talks about the

774
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:17,060
book this was bugging chat Google

775
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,640
that he could inspire another

776
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,929
conversations or something like that and

777
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,030
they never talk about their box which is

778
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,920
a problem because without good examples

779
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,629
we cannot show good examples to Bach

780
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,710
hunters that are just starting so we

781
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,180
started encouraging them

782
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:31,610
we created a theater account and we

783
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,170
started telling people to please do it

784
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,770
but then still they were not doing it so

785
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:39,830
then we pay a youtuber to write videos

786
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,450
about other people's box and because now

787
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:44,149
they become famous because he has lots

788
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,220
of followers then people are doing it

789
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,470
but it took us like multiple attempts to

790
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,700
get to get people to talk about their

791
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:52,450
books and we want people to talk about

792
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:55,700
their box because we want more bugs

793
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:58,580
anyway so the summary for this is one

794
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:01,280
good one easy way to resolve burnout is

795
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:05,050
to have more cool vulnerabilities one

796
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,399
easy way to not have to handle so many

797
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,530
to not get those with so many questions

798
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,180
is by asking questions yourself to work

799
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:16,100
on tours especially how is this

800
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:17,570
exploitable or why teaching is teaching

801
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,879
bug hunters about their bug about

802
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,129
vulnerabilities is a great use of

803
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,590
resources and helps in many ways and

804
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,420
this closure has helped us find more

805
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:29,659
bugs and get more back indoors with us

806
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,310
and that's it I think I'm almost of

807
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,580
times and that's exactly the time so

808
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:36,850
thank you very much

809
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:39,510
[Applause]

810
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,219
[Music]

811
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:45,250
thank you for the presentation we have

812
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:52,210
time for maybe one or two question is

813
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:54,310
there any question no okay so you can

814
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,490
talk with Eduardo later thank you it

815
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,490
other
