2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,240
welcome to blackout22 welcome in hivard

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,080
Oliver

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,780
so I am Silvan bazini founder and

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,940
president of Black Ops and I will give

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,340
you a few information about the event

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,439
um I will start but with a bit of

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,539
History we started with the main event

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,619
in 2011 here in ivarado and we had nine

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,940
editions each year until

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,719
2019 and for this event we were in

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,500
Hawaii Park and we changed this year to

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,940
lamariv it's the first year here

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,100
after 2019 we had a little changes in

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,559
the organizations

16
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,100
I can summarize the 2020 Edition in that

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,899
slide so we tried to come back in 2021

18
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,559
and we organized the main event

19
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,100
completely and then consult in August to

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,119
change to a new kind of event and as we

21
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,380
are in an Innovative ecosystem we try to

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,080
have an Innovative event and we thought

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,500
as we can not organize an event inside

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,920
we thought to organize

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,840
conference outside when it was the first

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,700
barbecue of the blackout

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,360
in share it's not far away from here 50

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,960
minutes 15 minutes uh biker and this

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,159
allowed the participant to have a nice

30
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,979
Sunset like that on the it was a great

31
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,579
event even it was smaller and then we

32
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,759
tried to organize this event for 2022

33
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,180
here we are and with the success of 21

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,460
Edition we thought okay a BBQ is a good

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,979
opportunity to meet all the community I

36
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,640
think black elves is one of the value is

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,699
to meet all the community together this

38
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,220
is why we don't choose to make any

39
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,620
virtual event during the sanitary

40
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,580
quizzes and we organized the barbecue so

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,760
now each year we will have a barbecue in

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,760
June it's just a social event to meet

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,280
all the people from the community and

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,800
now the main event in November as usual

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,520

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,160
