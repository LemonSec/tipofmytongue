1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,580
so hello everybody

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,059
um I'm very pleased to be here today and

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,980
talk about Buck Bounty and how we do it

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,480
at Swiss post

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,500
maybe some words about me my name is

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,740
Martina Schwab I'm 28 years old

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,880
I studied computer science at ffos with

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,660
the focus on information security and I

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,519
am an employee at this post for five

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,920
years but I'm working in the security

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,480
field now for about more than two years

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,660
uh as mentioned I am currently the head

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,540
of bug Bounty and I'm also I'm

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,000
coordinating penetration tests within

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,480
Swiss post

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,039
so

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,320
um who are we in general of course I'm

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,280
not the only computer a security expert

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,680
within this post we are actually in my

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,420
opinion a pretty big team of 70 persons

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,820
all with a very very different

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,280
backgrounds

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,200
um we have a lot of surprisingly a lot

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,159
of

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,479
female

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,080
um

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,200
workers or employees within the security

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,880
field

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,340
um we also have a lot of diversity

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,220
within the age from trainees that come

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,979
from unit University

32
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:28,799
to employees that have been within the

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,080
company for more than 10 15 years

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
so

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,240
what is our motivation as you know

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,820
um the security threats

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,540
um are constantly increasing our main

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,720
sectors Logistics public transport

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,780
e-voting digital health and digital post

40
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,180
services and financial services

41
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,159
we see during the last few years that

42
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,960
there's a constant

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,258
threats that is that we as a as a

44
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,319
company or as a team have to

45
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,879
um keep in check

46
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,680
this unfortunately is quite a challenge

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,739
because the attackers always get more

48
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,680
and more creative and even with 70

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,720
people that working constantly on

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,860
security

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,940
it is very hard to to cover all the

52
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,599
attack vectors

53
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,239
additionally it was a very broad sectors

54
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,819
that we are covering at Swiss post we

55
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,700
also have these uh very diverse trends

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,400
which we see and also have to keep in

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,680
touch there's of course always the human

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,959
factor which could be a threat there's

59
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,940
fishing that is constantly getting more

60
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,819
aggressive and is very very visible

61
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,680
within Swiss pose

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,900
we have the Deep fix that gets better

63
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,480
and better each year and we have to

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,700
learn to how to

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,819
um counter counteract to these

66
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,080
we have a privacy as a as a trend more

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,180
and more

68
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,480
companies do or abuse maybe personal

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,940
data and also we have private Seattle

70
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,640
cats who push for stronger data

71
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,059
protection

72
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,739
we have the topic about Supply chains

73
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,440
the companies are are more and more

74
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,480
connected with others with suppliers and

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,379
partners these links

76
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:42,739
are a possible

77
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,739
vulnerability or could be a way for

78
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,620
attackers to attack

79
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,519
other bigger companies

80
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,400
first this post also very important

81
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,900
concerning digital health or all the

82
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,680
health organizations we saw that that

83
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,140
organizations get more and more attacked

84
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,580
with the

85
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,940
with the patient talk uh informations

86
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,700
that gets stolen and are used as

87
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,720
blackmail

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,019
for ransom

89
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,418
we have a cyber immunity and zero trust

90
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,399
which is a big big Topic at the moment

91
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,759
at this post we want that every asset is

92
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,040
secured by itself we don't trust the

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,880
network

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,240
we need to secure the assets themselves

95
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,820
at the very least but not last there we

96
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,660
have all the industrial installation

97
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,280
vehicles and small devices

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,639
which also are possible attack lectures

99
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,020
and need to be covered

100
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,320
and all these Trends and factors

101
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,400
actually

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
um

103
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,900
causing our

104
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,479
security strategy one which is

105
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,080
participate security

106
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,560
and Bug Bounty is one of the

107
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,419
measurements to um

108
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,360
to to enable participative security

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,720
[Music]

110
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,400
um how is it working or why do are we

111
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,400
doing it as I mentioned number of cyber

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
attacks is increasing constantly and

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,940
it's very hard to keep up with the

114
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,340
necessary knowledge and know-how to

115
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,740
cover these attacks

116
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,720
on the other hand we have a whole

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,039
community

118
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,460
of let's say uh ethical hackers or

119
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,820
security researchers who have the

120
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,840
knowledge

121
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,979
and to to share and improve uh systems

122
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,759
with the park Bounty our goal is to

123
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,300
encourage these ethical hackers

124
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,300
to participate and share their knowledge

125
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,479
with us so we as a whole can improve our

126
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,080
systems and also find our blind spots

127
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,340
that we might have missed

128
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,380
for a bug bounty to work we have the

129
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,780
legal Safe Harbor which

130
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,580
um kind of defines the the the framework

131
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,000
in which uh ethical hacker can do his

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,180
research on our systems without having

133
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,759
to worry about any legal consequences

134
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,340
so I think most of you know what a bug

135
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,639
Bounty is for those who don't very short

136
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,560
what is a box Bounty or what is about

137
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,039
Bounty Hunter a buck Bounty Hunter he

138
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,380
finds vulnerabilities or as well or bugs

139
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,940
this box are found by these ethical

140
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,400
hackers who do not wish to do any harm

141
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,580
to a company but on the other hand they

142
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,280
report the vulnerabilities of the box to

143
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,400
the company to the system and

144
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,360
receive a reward for their

145
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,020
um for their work

146
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,860
how does it work at this post here's a

147
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,039
very very short diagram on how it works

148
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,759
uh on the first and the most important

149
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,539
part are the is the hacker community

150
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:27,680
which um finds and searches and finds

151
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,660
vulnerabilities on our systems

152
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,080
these vulnerabilities are then reported

153
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,360
we have a triosher who then checks these

154
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,979
reports and

155
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,220
to to see if these vulnerabilities are

156
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,460
reproducible and if they are

157
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,860
if they make sense

158
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,460
and if a vulnerability is reproducible

159
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,220
it then comes to the bug Bounty team

160
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,180
which in this case is is my team we then

161
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,660
check the report on its criticality and

162
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,319
then pay out a bounty accordingly

163
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,139
a report who is accepted then goes to

164
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,360
the project team or the development team

165
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,960
who is affected by set block

166
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,720
they fix the vulnerability report it

167
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,360
back to us and we then get in touch with

168
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,300
the hacker we bought who reported it to

169
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,199
get a verification about the fix

170
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,440
in case that a fix is verified we can

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,240
happily close it

172
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,700
in case that

173
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,820
um the volume is not fixed or the hacker

174
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,520
was able to find a bypass we then again

175
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,860
send it back to the project team until

176
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,700
the book is fixed completely

177
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,220
um how is our process or how do we do

178
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,899
our back Bounty programs so we don't do

179
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,240
bug Bounty programs and go public so

180
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,700
everybody can try and attack it our

181
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,760
systems this would be a lot of works on

182
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,080
our our site and we try to also

183
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,680
um slowly get the project teams into bug

184
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,500
Bounty and its processes so what we do

185
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,899
we we always start with a private part

186
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,779
Bounty which is a

187
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:25,860
a closed back Bounty where only a number

188
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,000
of hunters are invited and can do their

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,740
tests

190
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,100
it has the

191
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,820
big advantage that new Services can get

192
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,000
up hold and feel of how much mature

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,860
their services are and also

194
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,459
learn slowly learn the process of how

195
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,420
bug Bounty programs are working

196
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,600
as soon as we see that service doesn't

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,560
have as many reports or most of the

198
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,200
reports are fixed and there's not a lot

199
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,240
of

200
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,980
exchanges on the service anymore

201
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,380
we then switch the service to a public

202
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,560
Bounty where everybody is invited to

203
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,660
check out set service and test it

204
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,880
this is our main goal for every service

205
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,300
that is within the bug Bounty because in

206
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,260
that there everybody can see the service

207
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,880
um publicly exposed for everybody so all

208
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,060
all users customers can see and that we

209
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,880
are doing bug bounty on the service and

210
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,300
also that it doesn't have as many

211
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,560
reports in box anymore

212
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,600
so um here a bit bit of History where we

213
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,540
started actually it all started at 2018

214
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,899
when we did our very first

215
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,100
e-voting kit maybe some of you

216
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,519
remembered it it is wasn't our first bug

217
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,940
Bounty program but it did Lay the

218
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,140
fundament of it because there we first

219
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,360
um defined This legal Safe Harbor in

220
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,959
which we have formulated the the

221
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,980
the

222
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,480
the framework where or how Hunters can

223
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,420
search on our systems

224
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,540
we then on in 2018 the November of 2018

225
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,660
we then started the first small Park

226
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,600
where we did a

227
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,140
timely limited bug Bounty program with

228
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,279
selected five Services which we believed

229
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,160
oh no sorry eight eight sources where we

230
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,640
believed they were quite better and safe

231
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,700
and we then soon learned that wasn't the

232
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,079
case Within

233
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,220
about the month we had almost 50 high or

234
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,980
critical vulnerabilities on these five

235
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,800
eight services

236
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,339
so we have quite uh quickly learned the

237
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,339
impact that bug bounties can have

238
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,420
but this was actually a very positive

239
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,019
um

240
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,120
result because

241
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,060
we probably wouldn't have identified

242
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,360
these 50 High critical vulnerabilities

243
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,040
without the back Bounty and then could

244
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,940
initiates the actions to fix these

245
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,019
after this pork within started in 2020

246
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,839
our first official program which isn't

247
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,500
time Limited

248
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,959
um we then we then um

249
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,139
of uh continuously added more services

250
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,540
to the first aid

251
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,380
until 28

252
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,940
2021 where we

253
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,839
started to move at the first services to

254
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,560
the public program

255
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,420
this was one of a bigger step for the

256
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,720
whole company because many of the

257
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,399
operation teams were very worried that

258
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,100
there would be thousands of hackers

259
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,560
simultaneously

260
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,980
um attacking some services but we

261
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,320
quickly learned that we didn't have any

262
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,820
bigger issues about the accessibility of

263
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,260
our services and we're very well able to

264
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,060
to hold

265
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,040
hold them

266
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,939
hold it up

267
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,520
so this was the past today's 2020

268
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,820
[Music]

269
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,300
and what did we did this year well our

270
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,700
as I said our main goal is to go public

271
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,459
with everything and also all our

272
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,139
services

273
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,680
one of the first steps to do so was this

274
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,160
uh this tune where we went to low hat in

275
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,420
Paris

276
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,980
we did their life hacking event where

277
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:20,839
about 150 in hackers that were there had

278
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:27,300
a chance to hack all services of Swiss

279
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,459
post for a whole day

280
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,480
also this was a very very discussed

281
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,019
topic internally because

282
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,480
um we didn't know all the services that

283
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,839
are accessible or hosted by us

284
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,800
so we didn't know what to expect when

285
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,980
telling the hackers just go for it

286
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,500
but we were very pleased about the

287
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,600
results it wasn't it seemed that it

288
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,139
wasn't as easy anymore to find Big Box

289
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,199
we had at the end 22 new vulnerabilities

290
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,500
that we accepted

291
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,300
and there was a

292
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,000
only one high and one critical issue on

293
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,380
this day

294
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,060
so what this told us was that on one

295
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,699
hand the preparations over the last

296
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,680
three years did

297
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,880
carry fruits for us we were able to

298
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
improve many of our services

299
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,980
and also that we probably

300
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,740
covered most of the very very very easy

301
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,000
critical issues by now

302
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,899
foreign

303
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,540
that we said that we want to go

304
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,519
um you want to do uh not non-time

305
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,100
limited private part Bounty with this

306
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,740
very very big scope

307
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,519
so we started the post light bulk Bounty

308
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,579
program

309
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:09,000
where over 900 we think over 900 sub

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,399
domains are now

311
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,980
um part of the scope of our bug Bounty

312
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,440
program

313
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,360
we did switch the approach that they

314
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,420
used to have in the past we always

315
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,519
recruited the services for the buck

316
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,940
Bounty now all all the services are

317
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,540
within within the Bob Bounty program

318
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,180
except they have a very good reason not

319
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,599
to be

320
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
um at the moment it's still a private

321
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,740
program so there's only a a number a

322
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,899
limited number that is invited on this

323
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,120
private program but we do plan to

324
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,699
increase it this number constantly until

325
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,660
until we can go full public

326
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,779
thank you

327
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,839
so maybe here's some numbers about uh

328
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,140
what we did in these these years

329
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,660
so within this it's a bit more than

330
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,500
three years now and we did receive a

331
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,819
thousand five hundred different reports

332
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,859
from these reports

333
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,760
um we did accept 574.

334
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,540
which means these are all

335
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,540
um new and

336
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,760
a new box that we planned to to fix

337
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,440
um

338
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,440
117 of these reports were either high or

339
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,240
critical so these were fixed ASAP

340
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,120
20 40

341
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,299
247 were medium and 210 were of low

342
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,580
criticality

343
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,880
also what we I took found very

344
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,400
interesting was the types of the box

345
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,679
which were mostly found

346
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,559
for the high high criticality

347
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,600
vulnerabilities these would be

348
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,640
cross-site scripting business logic

349
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,000
errors and indirect

350
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,940
interact object references I think

351
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,679
that's right

352
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,620
so especially for the business logic

353
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,440
errors these are the kind of Olympics

354
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,380
that are very very hard to identify

355
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,640
uh

356
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,419
beforehand because

357
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:33,600
let's say automatic scannings or also

358
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,120
sometimes penetration tests because they

359
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,000
don't have as much time for searching

360
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,700
can't always finds these kind of Wonder

361
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,660
piece very easily

362
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,940
foreign so

363
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,059
what do we take from this

364
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,539
we saw that bug bounties does have a

365
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,419
impact on the maturity of our online

366
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,580
services

367
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,280
it by ex

368
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,260
um interacting with the outside

369
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,539
ethical hack Community we were able to

370
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,240
profit from their knowledge from their

371
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,380
experiences and use these to find

372
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,660
vulnerabilities and issues that they

373
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,760
probably wouldn't have detected in

374
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,039
another way

375
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,000
and also not a very positive effect that

376
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,700
we had with these new reports that we

377
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,419
received and we were able to take these

378
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,520
reports and use this as real examples to

379
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,059
uh train or Developers

380
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,700
on these kind of vulnerabilities

381
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,919
and through this we were able to not

382
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,700
just fix one issue in one service but

383
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,580
detect the same issue in different

384
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,220
services and fix those two even though

385
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,679
they were not in the back Bounty

386
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,980
initially

387
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,620
all these factors help us to improve our

388
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,640
services

389
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,160
and uh

390
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,660
really

391
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,440
really push the security

392
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,840
of CIS plus

393
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,559
to a new level

394
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,520
I think that's all for now I'm a bit

395
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,820
fast so I have a lot of time for some

396
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,178
questions

397
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,059
yes

398
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,840
thank you

399
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,939
[Music]

400
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,580
sure yeah

401
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,199
[Music]

402
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,820
ideas

403
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,860
and findings

404
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,340
here to your security life cycle of

405
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,559
it and that was the end of my question

406
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,240
so if I can repeat your question

407
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,340
did pogbound did the block Bounty

408
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,880
programs have an impact on the strategy

409
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,760
on how we do security within this post

410
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,900
and

411
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,260
yes so it did actually as I mentioned

412
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,780
very in the last we do use the reports

413
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,940
to train our developers

414
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,059
because of that we were able to detect

415
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,820
some kind of vulnerabilities that we

416
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,039
would have detected on our automatic

417
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,820
scanners if we adjusted them correctly

418
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,640
so we did that and through this we were

419
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,659
able to detect some issues now also much

420
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,480
more earlier in the development process

421
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,120
also what we did we we created a

422
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,940
best practice how to do secure

423
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,400
development

424
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,940
handout for each developer to to check

425
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,520
um how they can improve their coding

426
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,799
with a security perspective in mind

427
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,860
and maybe here first and

428
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,140
maybe using the microphone is better I

429
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,000
wonder you you mainly talk about

430
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,360
websites do you also check your client

431
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,880
applications your server infrastructure

432
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,820
and your other attack pads or is it just

433
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,520
in Apple Stores just limited to uh web

434
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,120
domains

435
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,720
so are we just checking

436
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,480
Services business facing services are

437
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,000
also

438
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,980
products within Cisco's true Park

439
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,460
bonding

440
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,940
client apps ah mobile applications Yes

441
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,580
actually we not just do uh do bug

442
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,280
bundles on web services but also on apis

443
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,620
mobile applications

444
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,240
we did some pop bounties for e-boarding

445
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,880
also on source code where it's publicly

446
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,140
available so there's there's not just

447
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,520
um web services yes but there is uh some

448
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,400
um restrictions we so far couldn't do

449
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,100
any background this on products which

450
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,679
are only accessible for

451
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,419
um internal

452
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,760
um use

453
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,679
thank you very much and congratulations

454
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,200
on getting

455
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,260
her into the future thank you very much

456
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,500
foreign

457
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,419
tester and I was interested in your

458
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,480
experience I was the findings of your

459
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,260
like traditional pen test versus the

460
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,720
result of the burgundy programmer

461
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,020
Compares and if you found the one or the

462
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,020
other to be more more effective Moscow

463
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,799
efficient cost efficient maybe or if you

464
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,220
find different things with them

465
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,400
[Music]

466
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,380
so the question is

467
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,799
do did I see or do did I see differences

468
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,960
between penetration testing and Bot

469
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,940
Bounty yeah especially if you use like

470
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,280
maybe the services of like traditional

471
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,679
security company uh where you like

472
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,860
mandate uh penetration test for for

473
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,120
scope and maybe a set of days Etc

474
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,480
so if um in my experience there is a

475
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,580
difference but but very hard to compare

476
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,980
both also

477
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,900
doing penetration tests and doing back

478
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,059
bounces they don't necessarily have the

479
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,679
same goal

480
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,559
for the penetrations tests that we do

481
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,980
and all our services are going through a

482
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,320
penetration test before going live

483
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,900
the main goal on this is to get the

484
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,240
services compliance to have this minimum

485
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,799
of security that we can offer before

486
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
um

487
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,460
making them available for our customers

488
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,559
with the bug Bounty however we really

489
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,640
want to

490
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,360
um

491
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,100
get more out maybe finds a ish

492
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,799
vulnerabilities that might not be found

493
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,559
in a penetration test because a

494
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,020
penetration test is always time limited

495
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,760
they have maybe a week maybe two weeks

496
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,059
or they have this test

497
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,799
test window and then they need to be

498
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,120
they have to be finished and they can't

499
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,059
go any further so in the back Bounty the

500
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,419
hackers have much more time to really do

501
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,220
some scanning to some probing try

502
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,240
something try it a week later

503
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,159
and the

504
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,840
what what I believe is that

505
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,699
um from the cost perspective

506
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,380
um if a service

507
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,840
isn't mature yet or we don't know if

508
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,940
it's material yet it's always better to

509
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,640
do a penetration test first because then

510
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,240
you can really find the easy and low

511
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,820
hanging fruits first which

512
