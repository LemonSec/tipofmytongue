1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,370
but it is a todos that's a carries comer

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,910
all that our sir Rosalind every way in

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,040
Peru Lokar that Allah first of all I'd

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,320
like to thank the routine Organization

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,419
for allowing me to be here talking a

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,470
little bit but what I know is a real

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,000
pleasure to be here

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,000
I can actually

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,060
t-carr one of the things I wanted to do

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,450
before I die

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,729
but she's presenting uprooted senior

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,070
project manager is to group oh and

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:39,610
sometimes I'm also happiness manager and

14
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,610
I think there are some of my clients

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,949
basically we we just kick the back of

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,250
system is our anchors we do for a second

17
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:54,699
Alice's and we are 100% blue but we're

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:58,700
going to talk about other things

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:02,510
this presentation was a base diffuse and

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,790
you know this is sound familiar

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:08,240
is it Gauss Bell a normal distribution

22
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:12,220
and then email think okay where am i art

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,500
it is crazy guy statistics probability

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,390
for the subjects are university that we

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,110
love so much while these gone down

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:23,210
spells are so interesting because nobody

27
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,869
Sabine allows us to do the graphics

28
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:30,410
artists and to share our tributes in a

29
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:34,340
certain and truthful way for example

30
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:36,229
this is aficionados well-regarded bad

31
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,690
news you know it's giving example if

32
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,660
house yes does not like commercial

33
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:46,520
doesn't more or less 68% of all of us

34
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:52,250
here should imagine as a high charge of

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:59,520
age between 116 180 centimeters

36
00:01:52,250 --> 00:02:01,620
sigmund team pons is 6% will be between

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,170
180 ml 90 please raise your hand if

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,350
there's you can smaller

39
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,880
2.1% will be the people who are really

40
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,400
tall with the mark that is more than

41
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:19,140
more than 90 centimeters between 100 and

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:21,900
200 other anyone one person is that very

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,100
tall out of the scale those are the

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,590
people higher than 200 centimeters is

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,560
there anyone here okay so more or less

46
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:38,970
these girls Bali is useful tomorrow do

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:41,610
not lack of use that skill set of

48
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,970
abilities allow us to develop the

49
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:54,030
talents can adapt this ability for

50
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:55,440
cybersecurity beginning of

51
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,350
representations of Voodoo

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,109
these are massive algorithm model to

53
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,329
find more delays excellent is our

54
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,900
security but I would like to know about

55
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:09,540
3 skills basic you capabilities your

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,340
attitude your goodness and passion for

57
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,679
learning and your experience because

58
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,390
eventually the devil you know is more

59
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:23,100
for being out of being the devil we have

60
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,290
a personal question is to be known or

61
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,340
the capability if your sample security

62
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:34,790
well you aren't

63
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:38,530
Novato being or being the amazing hubs

64
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,530
or work students are you here here here

65
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:47,359
in fact this is a tricky question this

66
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,518
is the basis of my whole presentation

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,060
kind of twelve you are in way because

68
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,540
one question is not at were you aren't

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:59,030
brother what do you think you are and

70
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,420
what's problem here the other assess

71
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,150
plate separation between the ability to

72
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,140
perceive the beauty how good you think

73
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,349
you are

74
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:14,119
what we are and the real and ability

75
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:18,108
that is how good we really are if we

76
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,789
find these we see a problem which is a

77
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,760
deviation they have some value without

78
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,680
reference a reference is higher than

79
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,430
zero and this one will suit from

80
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:33,229
autumn's the value is higher the higher

81
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:37,130
values that we 1230 separately because

82
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:41,510
it's a very different cases and what

83
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:46,159
others is hot due to the so called

84
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:48,380
cognitive bias which is basically where

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,639
did you brain receives correctly the

86
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:57,530
information you know but because it's

87
00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:03,280
not convenient interprets it so your

88
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:06,830
brain is strong in you draw ourselves

89
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,859
let's see what happens yeah so first

90
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:13,909
case you think that you are here

91
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,789
you think that a man I'm okay when in

92
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:19,009
fact you're a really kind of a little

93
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:23,090
person what is the basis for this basic

94
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:25,970
face in fact it's not really cute yes I

95
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:31,099
usually say he's a very brave job you

96
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:34,250
know well you need to know being good in

97
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:36,889
internal pentesting reversing 30,000

98
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,590
sobriety system your database is program

99
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,900
yum yum butoh currency is regulation

100
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,729
language is a bit of everything really

101
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,590
you need to have a wide range of

102
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:50,300
abilities some of this is just not

103
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,419
enough to know a little bit to have some

104
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,509
foundations you need to know a lot about

105
00:05:53,419 --> 00:06:00,370
many things what happens here are these

106
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:05,479
truths if you work in cybersecurity

107
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,620
Carson Donald 18 working lifetime as a

108
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,289
bond when you're happy with yourself

109
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,150
either go and say okay I'm in a good

110
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:16,810
place now and then one day you open

111
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,810
Twitter and you realize a lot of sorrow

112
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,620
for something or cyber security company

113
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:26,810
okay

114
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,990
80 people it's amazing okay I'm not good

115
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,479
enough

116
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:36,199
piece of basically and that's what

117
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,969
we call the imposter zero that is you

118
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,810
are someone quite competent well you

119
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:45,319
think you unless you actually are which

120
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:48,500
is quite common in cybersecurity

121
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,900
a survey of Twitter don't louse am out

122
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,509
of a hundred and thirteen votes not just

123
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,250
for people he's got a good sample a

124
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,800
third of the people thought that there

125
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,250
were posters on a daily basis on a

126
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,250
constant

127
00:07:13,030 --> 00:08:11,750
that happens but means that you are

128
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:14,569
connected because you believe that

129
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm not good enough and that generates

130
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:21,620
two more things stress because it is

131
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,270
impossible today to be good everything

132
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,289
to do with cybersecurity I compare that

133
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:29,900
with medicine you asked and I expert to

134
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,870
know a lot about the ophthalmology but

135
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:36,370
it's but you wouldn't ask her and after

136
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:40,190
biologists to do you know hard transport

137
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:44,839
or even to say if this my conscious is

138
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:49,880
caused by a or b so people are under

139
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:53,350
stress they work everything they can

140
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,350
that leads to burnout

141
00:08:55,079 --> 00:09:00,638
always a few years behind the United

142
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,699
States but in the United States were

143
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:07,629
beginning to see how in conferences on

144
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:10,719
the mental health of security people

145
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:13,360
they've dealt with in conferences it's a

146
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,870
job with a lot of pressure and there is

147
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,699
a certain cost about the mental health

148
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,019
of people working here so how do we

149
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:23,680
detect it

150
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:31,449
the main you say is this feeling of you

151
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:33,128
feel your frog bones too hard and any

152
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:35,939
day now they're gonna notice that I'm

153
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:39,189
not good enough and I'm gonna be fine

154
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:40,810
when I do something right I say well I

155
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,490
was lucky today

156
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,069
when I have these colleagues who will

157
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:49,000
really help me out or anything else so

158
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:51,519
success it's never ours it's always

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,779
things that have happened for some other

160
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,389
reason and because I am fro how am I

161
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:04,509
going out of dare to do all your stuff

162
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:09,790
if I leave my comfort zone it's obvious

163
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:14,529
that I'm a fraud so what happens with

164
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:17,829
this this is a considerable professional

165
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:21,220
obstacle why if you have these three

166
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:24,250
fear doing new stuff then you'll make

167
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,839
less progress you won't leave that

168
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:32,160
comfort area and you won't make progress

169
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:39,540
and from a more selfish viewpoint the

170
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:43,629
fraud syndrome is the dream of the

171
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,459
company owners you have great people

172
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:49,029
that if you put a bit more pressure on

173
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:50,649
them you can pay less for because they

174
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:53,050
don't if they don't realize how good

175
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:55,389
they are so we're gonna move forward a

176
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,758
bit reality is that we have our

177
00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:00,630
knowledge everybody has some knowledge

178
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,310
and things are not the way

179
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,100
they look it's not that everybody else

180
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,410
has knows a lot more is that we have our

181
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,170
spirit of knowledge and other people all

182
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,910
have a different sphere of knowledge but

183
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:16,079
did that alum knowledge may be very

184
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,400
similar so that's the first case we're

185
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,280
going to look at the second one what

186
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,270
happens when we believe that we are here

187
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:27,420
and we're actually there what's the name

188
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,390
for this this is a more academic name

189
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:39,660
it's what we call the dunning-kruger

190
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:43,050
effect that was anybody sorry when this

191
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:46,589
guy finally found out it was somebody

192
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:53,760
happy when they say great you you you

193
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:55,590
deserve what happens is that people that

194
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,990
this is the case when somebody feels

195
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:03,030
they are much better than they are for

196
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:06,380
instance I am world experts in in my

197
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:10,920
work reversing introduced in PLC

198
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:15,420
industrial applications in Siemens 4.21

199
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:20,550
I am the boss here so what happens with

200
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:30,589
this is his way to detect it yes they're

201
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:33,089
very clear symptoms muscles in this area

202
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,390
because you're always doing this gesture

203
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:38,160
saying I am the boss I am the one who

204
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:43,520
knows nobody knows more than I do know

205
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:46,560
about this boss I'm always right and I

206
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,699
am surrounded by people who are not as

207
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,410
good as me I put up with them because

208
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,670
they don't go to Google or to Facebook

209
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,740
because I'm not interested so what

210
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,819
happens we have two problems here these

211
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,919
people are actually less

212
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:13,228
Abell than they believe they often

213
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:16,589
compensate for that I other people

214
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:20,850
nearby so they are not good to work with

215
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:24,029
and they are terrible bosses because

216
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:27,509
they are always right so you're always

217
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:31,979
wrong and that actually is another

218
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:39,269
obstacle another professional obstacle

219
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:40,919
because I keep on sort of getting more

220
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:43,259
and more responsibilities people will

221
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,720
notice that you pretend that you're the

222
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:48,929
boss but you are not so good and people

223
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,449
will realize I'm not going to work with

224
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:53,369
you and the world of cybersecurity it's

225
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:54,599
very large but it's also very small

226
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:56,720
everybody knows somebody who knows

227
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,419
somebody who knows something

228
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,439
how could we fight against this syndrome

229
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:08,220
the Kreuger is to know that all that you

230
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:13,769
know is just one speck in the Hall of

231
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:16,859
knowledge and I am NOT going to talk

232
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:22,289
about PhDs but these applies very well

233
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:25,769
to the security world so we would like

234
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:28,289
for this standard deviation to be zero

235
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:31,979
or to approach zero ok and how do we do

236
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:35,009
that we do it like engineers we have

237
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:37,079
this we apply this feedback look we have

238
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:39,569
this input that you analyze and then you

239
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,238
have some outputs and with them you

240
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:46,079
rectify and you correct the signal to

241
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:50,970
try to minimize mistake in sort of in

242
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:53,159
our normal language that means sincere

243
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,499
an owner self-assessment and how do we

244
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,809
do that well the first thing we have is

245
00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:01,010
to try to collect data rather than

246
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:05,420
impressions like

247
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:09,050
I I think or I feel this is banana you

248
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:11,870
you have to use data in if possible

249
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:14,870
whenever possible external sources and

250
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,540
it's better if you have different inputs

251
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:20,240
rather than one or two and this is a

252
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,029
process and our going process that you

253
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,120
have to iterate and this is the

254
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:28,790
philosophy that's a philosophy of the

255
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,329
feedback loop loop you don't do it once

256
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:34,189
but all the time

257
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:38,089
advice recommendation which there are a

258
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:41,269
few that I think that I recommend write

259
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:43,370
a book that may sound silly I know

260
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:47,449
nothing that's not true

261
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:50,420
I have solved hundreds of difficult

262
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:53,240
problems thanks to the fact that

263
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:59,899
somebody somewhere wrote in a blog

264
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:03,620
something that happened to them so it's

265
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:16,699
very frustrating in internet that you

266
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:19,190
have a incredibly rare problem who asked

267
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:24,050
about the problem didn't you know right

268
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:27,519
the answer if you write you have to

269
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:32,029
think to work and to be aware that

270
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:37,550
because this is going to be read by a

271
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:40,360
lot of people than you take them you

272
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:44,810
feel that you have to generate a quality

273
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:48,980
content and and that actually encourages

274
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:50,810
or enhances your self-confidence another

275
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,140
option is to participate in projects

276
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:56,420
that are maybe

277
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:59,579
thousands of open projects open cold

278
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,819
projects and that you can participate in

279
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:06,419
and I hate when people say I hate it

280
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,309
when people say my code is not good so I

281
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:13,589
won't cooperate what your maybe your

282
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:18,209
code can be improved but the first class

283
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:23,879
in the network's subject I was thrown a

284
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:26,089
coming under Richard and and they said

285
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:31,350
at the end of the course you need to

286
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:35,040
program this and in a lot well I'm not a

287
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:38,219
great program it but I have a very

288
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:42,059
documented code so if my programming is

289
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:44,100
not good maybe it's not but my analysis

290
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,928
of the whole problem I can give it to

291
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,049
you and you can improve it and once

292
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:54,990
you've improved my code I can also use

293
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:59,010
it and that's a win-win situation there

294
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:06,410
is a refrain that's as if you know you

295
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:06,410
work and if you don't you teach I I

296
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:15,120
tried not to share when I'm even talks

297
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:18,380
but if you're teaching and you're really

298
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:23,000
teaching then you have to need a lot of

299
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:27,900
trust in yourself to confident to face

300
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:32,040
20 30 40 experts and to teach them

301
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:35,429
something and be open to all of the

302
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:40,440
questions that they are going to to deal

303
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:43,919
with it's a great way of really knowing

304
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,059
very thoroughly a subject and also to

305
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,450
gain trust and your confidence

306
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:53,220
I also recommend to be mentoring

307
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,230
mentoring is very white rain in the

308
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,760
United States but is not so common here

309
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,760
in Spain people with more years

310
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,240
experience should take junior people and

311
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,070
teach them I

312
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:09,100
if you like this try these stools even

313
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:12,189
like this so you have to take people by

314
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,699
hand and that's very interesting because

315
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:19,899
I've always said and cybersecurity

316
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:26,890
really experience is a great health I've

317
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:28,539
always thought that we are in a pathway

318
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,000
and those of us who've made more

319
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:34,600
progress have to help those coming

320
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,690
behind and say there is a stone there

321
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,449
there's a there's water over there and

322
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:44,890
this is a great place to eat and it's

323
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:47,679
good because it also helps to help you

324
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:50,470
learn because people come in behind you

325
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,260
or have less experience but they're not

326
00:19:50,470 --> 00:20:00,820
I have learned a lot from the people I'm

327
00:19:53,260 --> 00:20:03,158
mentoring as you can do here which is

328
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,850
also very interesting I don't know if

329
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:12,370
you know but all of you why engineers or

330
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:17,439
have a degree you can see the end of the

331
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:20,049
degree studies or and and you can

332
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,320
actually collaborate with the university

333
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:24,850
you can contribute in interesting

334
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,490
projects but I am no longer the

335
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,439
University there are other I tried to

336
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,350
lead one project at least because in

337
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,640
many universities a end of the degree

338
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:38,980
work is it's just something that the

339
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,750
teacher can use for their PhD or for

340
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,960
projectors are involved in but if you're

341
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:46,779
able to lead projects or ideas that

342
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:52,360
you're giving people at the end of their

343
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:55,360
studies so to take a step into the world

344
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,928
of cyber security with something else

345
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,250
than just a degree is on top or else can

346
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:03,880
we do

347
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:07,659
assessment at some jobs to earn you half

348
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:10,360
every year a session about how well

349
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:12,789
you've done things how and that I has an

350
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,070
impact on your partners and so on but in

351
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:17,379
in other cases you don't but if you have

352
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,240
a good relationship with your boss that

353
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,330
it would be a great idea to check with

354
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:26,620
them how am i doing what do I do well

355
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:28,629
what can i improve and sometimes they

356
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,610
don't have the exact information but

357
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,280
they will certainly often will give you

358
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,350
an input that it will be valuable for

359
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,570
instance your you need to improve the

360
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:44,350
your reports you're very good in

361
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:47,830
phonetics something else send proposals

362
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:52,770
to conferences now I'm very bad this is

363
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:58,689
all interested for anybody you summer

364
00:21:52,770 --> 00:22:01,990
know a while ago I almost took a train

365
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:04,360
to a city that's not your PI to track

366
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,789
physically somebody who was bigger than

367
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,918
me to make a presentation at a

368
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:12,370
conference I have a telegram

369
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:16,150
conversation which is no no come on do

370
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:18,158
make that presentation come on do it you

371
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:22,590
gotta be very selective of what you're

372
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:25,600
doing is great so he presented it it was

373
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:29,049
accepted and he it was a great success

374
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:33,129
so sometimes you're like in trust them

375
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:35,139
if you prepare a talk and you document

376
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:39,030
it properly well maybe you won't get it

377
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,460
but the that's the worst that can happen

378
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,570
something as recruitment processes

379
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:47,320
recruitment process for their third

380
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,189
companies is a perverse wave of having a

381
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:54,789
self-assessment

382
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:56,950
why because you need a you you have a

383
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:59,980
third person a third party that's

384
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,740
completely objective it was as you and I

385
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,929
have I know somebody who does a

386
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,929
recruitment process is just as a sport

387
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:16,439
I won't name him because there are many

388
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,360
companies here but he probably has done

389
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,509
a recruitment process with one of your

390
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,789
companies and people accept him because

391
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:26,850
he's very good and he does it when his

392
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:34,950
morals are low so he says no and he

393
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:37,439
confirms how good he is think of those

394
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:41,279
processes as something positive for you

395
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:47,129
that you can't get something out of one

396
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:50,580
of my mentor guys did when sort of asked

397
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:53,009
for a job in Facebook and and he had he

398
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:56,809
had made it to the third interview and

399
00:23:53,009 --> 00:24:02,129
there the recruiter said ah but you have

400
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:04,918
experience this is very you have no

401
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:07,860
experience we asked for two or three

402
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,139
years of experience so it was great that

403
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:18,029
he made it to the third interview in

404
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:21,090
Facebook and actually they said we like

405
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:24,539
your CV you don't have the experience we

406
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:30,449
need but in two years time to approach

407
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:33,559
us and he was very his confidence was

408
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:38,070
really by this what else can you do

409
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:41,309
brain is funny and with this cognitive

410
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:43,649
biases if you did have you named good

411
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:48,389
things in a part one what do you keep in

412
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:52,199
mind the part one so what should you

413
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:55,799
learn to do what you have to assess or

414
00:24:52,200 --> 00:25:00,360
value your achievements months ago there

415
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:02,789
was a guy writing who told me he wrote

416
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,559
down all his successes every time the

417
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:08,840
boss said you've done very well or

418
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:12,330
somebody he took a picture and he had a

419
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,220
little file but he introduced all of his

420
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,870
achievements and when one day he was

421
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:21,640
feeling lower then he take a look

422
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:23,770
and okay so it's it's silly but since

423
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,070
our brain units drawing us we should

424
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:30,490
also troll our brain and also fear of

425
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:35,620
failure in the Saxon culture if your

426
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:39,220
failure is not so present you can you

427
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:41,649
can fail but but at this you've tried it

428
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:44,890
worse here in Spain were very critical

429
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,700
with the failure he tried to do this and

430
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,250
it didn't work

431
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:52,750
there was one sentence that I thought

432
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:58,570
was of the the founder of them which is

433
00:25:52,750 --> 00:26:02,140
I never lose either I get it right or I

434
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:04,360
already learned so we have to be brave

435
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:08,530
enough to take risks to leave our

436
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:12,520
comfort zone and also to learn from that

437
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:16,800
failure it's not bad to fail it's part

438
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:19,510
of the natural process of learning

439
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,520
what's important is don't fail twice at

440
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,770
the same thing so we have to learn and

441
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:32,290
we have to improve as a person and as a

442
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:36,370
professional let's assume that the cow

443
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:38,260
is round if you do not have one syndrome

444
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,840
or the other how can we help our

445
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:45,340
colleagues there's something that's

446
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,580
incredibly cheap and it works very well

447
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,730
we just like knowledge somebody else's

448
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:52,210
achievements

449
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,880
I don't know if in leadership teams this

450
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:59,520
is discussed but I people are not aware

451
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:03,640
how important that the pat on the back

452
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,940
has it's zero cost and it has a great

453
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:10,540
value my boss my name was fine that's a

454
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:16,430
great feeling make constructive

455
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:21,950
criticism our community is great

456
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:24,800
but we are a bit patrol really or maybe

457
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,250
a lot of a troll really in twitter is

458
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,980
like plague really so we have to learn

459
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:33,410
to do constructive criticism this is

460
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,450
wrong but you could approach it this way

461
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:39,950
how about doing that you have that tool

462
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:42,980
let's not be unnecessarily aggressive

463
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:45,710
but try to build so that when I

464
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:51,200
criticize because sometimes you are

465
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:55,640
giving and sometimes you're receiving so

466
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,310
if we can break this vicious circle

467
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,130
we're all going to be better and then

468
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:04,159
help out this is something that's not so

469
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,750
hard I think with the route is quite

470
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,280
well because there is a great feeling in

471
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:10,400
this community and I think most of the

472
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:15,770
time you find somebody to help out but I

473
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:22,730
also believe is very important is not to

474
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:25,430
accept certain things the fraud syndrome

475
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,930
and the doing Krueger's are opposite but

476
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:30,920
there is a particularly dangerous

477
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:34,010
combination of those what happens if in

478
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,760
a room full of people who have different

479
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:40,310
levels of the fraud syndrome you

480
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:45,200
introduce one doing in Kruger what's

481
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:51,050
gonna happen you can tell both syndromes

482
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:55,490
are going to feed to feed look feedback

483
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:58,159
with each other so the the fraud

484
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:01,730
syndrome people perhaps going to feel

485
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,680
even less competent in the face of the

486
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,740
surgeon in Kruger syndrome so what

487
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:10,580
should we do well if somebody is

488
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:14,450
overdoing it you should say what are you

489
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,699
to him so to be an active part to stop

490
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,649
this phenomenon

491
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,789
part of the solution and I like to use

492
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:24,070
this concept of the epidemiologist which

493
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:29,080
is the group immunity you see what the

494
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:32,710
idea is yes this is like a donor Krueger

495
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,779
the fraud system if we try to block the

496
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,690
effect of the dueling crooked and then

497
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:39,100
more people are on the what do you think

498
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:42,870
you're doing or what do you think you're

499
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:46,689
calling the impact of the agent included

500
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:51,090
on the population becomes very rare

501
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:54,850
that's great for everybody okay

502
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:58,299
very quick conclusions being here is

503
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:03,370
great being here is great and being here

504
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:08,440
is also good I have an important

505
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:15,070
criticism for a trend that says this is

506
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:18,480
full of media crap people being mediocre

507
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:21,549
or being average means that you're here

508
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,460
so being average is not a problem

509
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:27,879
because their work to get there and to

510
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,419
stay there it's very hard and so that's

511
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,080
fine

512
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:35,080
so being average is fine but we have

513
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,309
this feeling that either you are the

514
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:41,019
best rock star your and of course

515
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:43,149
people who are incredibly good in

516
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:47,100
cybersecurity fill any of you remember

517
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:50,850
about the aesthetic of bad distribution

518
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:53,709
but we are where most people are and

519
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,250
there's no problem with that as a is

520
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:00,399
quite an achievement what do we have to

521
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:02,860
do where we have to assess ourselves we

522
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,709
have to know with as much precision as

523
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,110
possible where we are and to work to be

524
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,820
a bit better at the end of the day we

525
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,860
have to take into account that you

526
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,529
cannot change your environment

527
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,279
you cannot make people smarter or

528
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:17,620
sillier

529
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,929
but you can make yourself better and

530
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,389
there is a sentence from like that says

531
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:25,480
you are only copied competing against

532
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:27,129
yourself you can certainly make sure

533
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,640
that you are a bit better and for that

534
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:30,980
what do we need to do

535
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:36,200
well basically in many cases we have to

536
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:40,940
leave the comfort area stop being afraid

537
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:47,080
and we tend to forget we also have to be

538
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:49,340
nice I'm incredibly happy with my boss

539
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,070
that's one of the reasons why I'm still

540
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:56,770
where am i where am i oh and one of the

541
00:31:52,070 --> 00:32:02,870
things he's done is that he doesn't hire

542
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:05,139
great heights stupid guidance people are

543
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,370
nicer or not so nice but everybody is

544
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,790
reasonably nice and that's something

545
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:14,928
that makes the team that gives it him a

546
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:17,928
completely different feeling so the

547
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:20,210
final conclusion is that knowing

548
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:24,200
ourselves a bit better we're able to

549
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:26,090
know how to improve ourselves and the

550
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,590
techniques that I've mentioned if you

551
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,780
use the techniques I've mentioned here

552
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,570
you're going to generate knowledge will

553
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,700
improve the community and the philosophy

554
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:39,139
with which I want to finish is that if

555
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:43,130
we improve and we produce better content

556
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:45,620
we help everybody else improve and from

557
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,270
being a great community will be we will

558
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:52,580
move on to be just an astonishing

559
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:54,200
community thank you by the way there you

560
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,470
have the slides here if you want to use

561
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,470
