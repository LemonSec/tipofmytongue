00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,590
around here that's a great news when you

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:26,660
talk about the area of crazy idea that's

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:28,920
wrong and you know the data and many

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:40,320
services from a telephonic oh there's a

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:43,170
Spanish to the car company respected by

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,430
the powerful papers it's not like you

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,460
said to me by the sponsor on the

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,940
presentation here were selected by

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:01:00,890
scores so here we have the great

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:04,470
speakers so braggy know represent Oh

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,979
Kelly Cutrone so my name is miracle de

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,619
Castro I work in the impact so what do i

17
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,650
do therefore don't know me you know that

18
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:19,710
I don't like to work too much I'm more

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:23,220
prone to have fun I'm lucky enough to

20
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,770
have a good time working in security and

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,840
checking malware and I can do that in

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,970
telefónica I can have a good time there

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:38,490
there's always some particle of no

24
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:42,090
Richard we had one Aykroyd party fact is

25
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,449
it is a pleasure to work there and fun

26
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,820
and what teach people have a few people

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,829
who were my students I hope you will

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,300
enjoy the presentation my name is pablo

29
00:01:52,829 --> 00:02:00,240
cementerio i'm

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:02,100
University lucky now to work in

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,949
California with college after I

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,579
mentioned and quality monocular and

33
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,530
others and the good fortune to have

34
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,260
cooperate with them in several projects

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,310
I would also like to thank rooted for

36
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:20,929
organizing this event as well as the

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,930
volunteers who make this event

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,020
especially happy because I have

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,480
contributed to the logo these are the

40
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,090
horns that I often distribute at the

41
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,760
bootcamp of exploiting we've been doing

42
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,470
that for two to three years now and as

43
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,450
we have seen okay we'll have

44
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,859
participated in Romans core well rather

45
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:47,790
the rooted coin going to the

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,140
presentation from Cyril you may have

47
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,410
guessed that to say we will be

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,820
discussing email email nowadays continue

49
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,820
to be one of the main vectors of

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:01,350
infection in the latest news during the

51
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,030
news you will see that many attacks come

52
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,549
from email or whenever there is an

53
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,850
attacker email is suspected to be the

54
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,150
vector of it so here we see a graph here

55
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:16,709
including different type of protocols

56
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,450
SMT were browsing and then I'm up so if

57
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,260
we were to attack the difference would

58
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,709
be even greater

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,260
so here email of has two advantages to

60
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,290
either can use it in a massive manner at

61
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,109
the reaching out lots of recipients urge

62
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,429
you may just targeted with specific

63
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,350
individuals so email well I had a

64
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,510
teacher who just explains in this

65
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,760
fashion and said well perhaps the icon

66
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,859
of this email is not the best because we

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,170
tend to think that it is just a postcard

68
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,060
and card that you put in an envelope

69
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:53,670
whereas the postman can see who is the

70
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,860
recipient and who is the person who sent

71
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,530
it well in case the person who senses I

72
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,420
said or write some his name and then

73
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,200
what I get to see at the end at the

74
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,829
bottom of emails is he says well if

75
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,290
these

76
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,870
the email is not targeted are you please

77
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,760
do not read it and if not you will be

78
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,760
severely punished and this and that

79
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:22,410
unless is one of those change that you

80
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,650
both sense as you and you're not

81
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,890
authorized to read okay that's the only

82
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:33,299
time where these disclaimer is useful

83
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:39,000
now let us move on and tell you where

84
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:48,090
the our research started from so

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:55,830
Pakistan is not talking about in a sari

86
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:59,489
telco Alliance once out of the syringe

87
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,520
and Holly who was in Pakistan told us he

88
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,600
had received a number of calls from

89
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,440
planks I didn't know that there were

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,520
bugs in Pakistan but anyway they had

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,740
been stolen six million dollars and then

92
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,840
he said well I need some information I

93
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,470
need to give an answer to this man and

94
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,340
then on that point I asked him about the

95
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,340
name of the bank

96
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:31,950
look the sh t domain of the bank and

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,830
lucky enough I got this email I found

98
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,979
this email then I went through the email

99
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:42,210
I looked into it I could see that it

100
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:49,650
came in with a zip file the email comes

101
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:52,739
from the impact site and then when we

102
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,250
continue looking into it we could see

103
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,750
this trillion at wind which is often

104
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,300
used for deceptive attacks it is

105
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,150
multi-platform were made in Java the

106
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,860
rejection rate was not very high and

107
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,080
when we played around with the sample

108
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,819
the feed we could see that the IP and

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,340
domain that was being crashed down

110
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:17,520
life the communication in the bank was

111
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:21,000
still open and this was very much likely

112
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,099
to be related to the action then we took

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,680
it from there and then we said how we

114
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:29,969
can industrialize these how we can

115
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,250
automate it to find the set of things in

116
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,460
a more of an automatic massive

117
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,180
convenient manner and for that we set up

118
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:43,049
mail

119
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:46,530
Mincy mail Mincy takes emails from

120
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:49,770
different sources we are members of CT a

121
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:53,698
service unit Alliance and there we have

122
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:57,568
repositories of malware and words and

123
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:00,150
lots of crap and you name it what we do

124
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,880
there is that everything that gets to us

125
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,159
it goes through an automatic system then

126
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,319
we ask whether countries seen before

127
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:09,900
whether attachments have been seen

128
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:15,680
before a classified them we also send it

129
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:18,750
to the sandbox and then we also

130
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,659
technology that having developed our

131
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,219
innovation laboratory of 11 paths so

132
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:27,150
this is a technology that applies

133
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:29,009
machine learning old documents and PDFs

134
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:32,818
to sending the documents and this

135
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:35,550
technology eliminates or remove personal

136
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,830
details elements that are not relevant

137
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,460
for us to detect whether these malicious

138
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:43,680
or not so we just remind you about your

139
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,590
personal data because your

140
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,490
confidentiality is first and foremost so

141
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:53,250
these three technologies will help us

142
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:57,750
detect attacks to find out what the

143
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:04,680
origin of those attacks I know we see

144
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:07,139
the results we can make such type of

145
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,719
government first devices will fight us

146
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,860
also the emails that have been received

147
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:16,319
well is the country where this email was

148
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,389
uploaded for the first time but there's

149
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,910
been seen or not so we have to become

150
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:23,550
perhaps of five a thousand the five

151
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:27,570
the technology that detects it the

152
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:30,180
technology that did not detect it in the

153
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,610
first place but we're successful in

154
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,090
detecting it later on and then single

155
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,640
plate of detection we can't do that but

156
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,849
in terms of the sandbox rejas and the

157
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,790
mutation in terms of the number of files

158
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,560
that could upload but good enough

159
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,230
 the last weeks they have

160
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,380
extended the number of files that we

161
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,900
could upload then in terms of countries

162
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,920
number of countries that are using total

163
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:02,550
virus to detect magua we see quite a

164
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:07,380
strong trend here in the US and then we

165
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:10,949
see pay up API of total - we can see who

166
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:14,189
is the person or the country or the

167
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:16,050
entity that has detected the virus in

168
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,010
the first place or the attacks in the

169
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,990
first place so this is a diary diary you

170
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,650
can consult the elements that you have a

171
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:28,380
low reader those that were in the diary

172
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:31,590
you can check out the mattress and then

173
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,260
you can make searches and to see the

174
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:37,050
relationship with any other file if you

175
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,170
see an indication in that file which is

176
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,810
kind of outstanding you can also see

177
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,660
what is the level of relationship with

178
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:48,060
other type of files and those of you

179
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,699
who'd like to use diary there is a

180
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,520
programming API just in case you want to

181
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:57,590
send in files and to make it automated

182
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,230
so you have these entire e dot e Pat's

183
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:04,500
comm if you send in an email to lab at

184
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,110
11 Pat's calm and then you identify

185
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,820
yourself and routed X addition they'll

186
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,500
give you the chance to try out the

187
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,580
platform and for you to send in your

188
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:18,450
samples some of these statistics here we

189
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:22,920
have compiled in less than four months

190
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:25,250
for minified and seventy six hundred

191
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,199
thousand emails

192
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:32,209
we have found lots of Windows

193
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:34,160
executables and countries that have

194
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:36,229
placed in this activity or emails France

195
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,750
the US and Canada so here

196
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,480
Spain is key at Bodmin this is a Spanish

197
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,519
product on which and use it as much I

198
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,670
don't know why that is because perhaps

199
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,649
we just I don't know we just turned down

200
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:55,000
a Spanish product or just because we

201
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:55,000
just don't like to pay other statistics

202
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,980
topics encrypted messages and I think

203
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,800
this was very much a little bit

204
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,430
condescending thousand euros every day I

205
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,959
don't know why I never how can I hold

206
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:17,410
the temptation of not opening up that

207
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:23,599
remain so Manuel dot txt China Chinese

208
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:25,310
language seep files PDF files that will

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,709
be detected more often than not as

210
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:40,008
Manuel so regarding subjects top 20 top

211
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:43,160
20 from emails bottom 20 in such a

212
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:45,889
states are like to see both top and

213
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:50,059
bottom that is to say the most and the

214
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:51,889
least used so these are the elements

215
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,319
that are used only once and this is

216
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:56,120
often indicators tell us about targeted

217
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:59,449
campaigns and campaigns that are not

218
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:04,459
aimed at creating lots of noise and then

219
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:13,579
we also have the top 22 females who is

220
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:19,670
getting the most emails Darwin and same

221
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:21,769
but bottom 22 emails so that is email

222
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:27,310
addresses people that have only received

223
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:31,870
one so we also did a search

224
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:35,498
about dot s to see the companies that

225
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,959
were using value stones almost for

226
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:40,480
detection we have banking for the

227
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,969
industry construction other sectors of

228
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,730
the sector's logistics in general the

229
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:49,329
banking sector uses total virus to

230
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:52,089
detect these malicious campaigns and the

231
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:56,769
same goes for two so very interesting

232
00:12:52,089 --> 00:13:00,009
when we did the we draw these statistics

233
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:02,649
we can see that one of the consulting

234
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:05,649
companies have received more than 75% of

235
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,629
those emails we will have to wear a see

236
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:10,089
when that happened controlling that was

237
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:12,189
an events so we really want to see

238
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,079
whether that company had a big events

239
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:16,569
and that's why those emails were sent

240
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,209
over that period of time the advantage

241
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:21,339
of having this type of tool offering so

242
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,920
many data is that you can make a search

243
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:26,350
and you can narrow down the results by

244
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,479
sector classified in by sector

245
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:34,120
Malcolm receives less than fifty percent

246
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:37,629
only the files with no threat with total

247
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,750
virus and then the US and France so as I

248
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:43,689
said they were the countries that up

249
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,819
Merlot do the most files and that we

250
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:47,920
also have recipient to mails to make our

251
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,959
side Gmail oh this is not a bank well

252
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,620
Apple is becoming a bank my gmail is not

253
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:57,939
analogous but Gmail it appears as the

254
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:00,189
recipients of email Turnbull has been

255
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:06,219
detected as malicious a survey on

256
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:09,519
Kazakhstan and Bulgaria front question

257
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:16,500
Jordan they wanted to fake the front of

258
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:16,500
Western Europe then these are the files

259
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:23,730
what documents PDF files are being used

260
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,729
in the banking sector

261
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:31,650
so in the telecom come sector 75% of the

262
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,720
emails and not exactly frontal virus the

263
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:36,030
API continues to be the same as the

264
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,550
previous one sends out a lot of info

265
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:41,790
both in France and in the u.s. in terms

266
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:44,250
of domains again Gmail shows up but then

267
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,339
recipients are more widely distributed

268
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:50,580
and regarding France there are four key

269
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,370
players or after sending messages to

270
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:57,270
telecom companies so here the level of

271
00:14:53,370 --> 00:15:00,840
maliciousness is much lower in terms of

272
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:07,020
Public Accounts public accounts Yahoo

273
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:09,630
Gmail Hotmail accounts over 50% France

274
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:13,530
in the US the origin where most of the

275
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,900
emails come from and then the email

276
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:19,020
account

277
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:21,510
Gmail Outlook Hotmail and yahoo have

278
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:26,280
received the highest number of malicious

279
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:27,480
email now this is share a distribution

280
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,360
more widely

281
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:35,310
so not only office as malicious but also

282
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:46,440
some Excel files and PDF files and now

283
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:49,229
government's oh thank you we've seen is

284
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,020
statistically what we found in different

285
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:55,170
sectors we found it was very interesting

286
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,569
to look into government because when you

287
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:00,420
do research there you will find with

288
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:05,520
Harry cool mug were more interesting and

289
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:10,530
sophisticated campaigns as you may see

290
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:13,790
now what you will see now so these

291
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:16,589
statistics have made look a bit boring

292
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:19,650
yet they are interesting the party mark

293
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:22,020
Tony well so we could go from the top

294
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:28,020
levels of statistic from applicant value

295
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:30,390
to do greatest depth as we will see in

296
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,920
remains with analytics data nor on in

297
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,380
terms of the volume but it's half of

298
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,170
Marberry need who is detecting Edam

299
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,760
is not detecting it why is that because

300
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,010
at the end of the day when you make

301
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,330
hunting in this type of a person when

302
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:49,770
you are looking for threats we are

303
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:53,880
looking for singularities so fix traps

304
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:55,079
this is what you are looking for kind of

305
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,460
liars

306
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:02,510
so you we have seen that lots of there

307
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:06,360
are lots of email attacks

308
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:10,339
531 emails that have ended up in public

309
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:13,560
sources we should not forget and that we

310
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:17,220
gain access to content of those emails

311
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,869
who is the sent to the content of the

312
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,410
attachments we are not talking about

313
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:31,729
malware only but information leaks and

314
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:37,500
data leaks which help the profile of the

315
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:39,480
company that wants to be attacked so

316
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:45,110
these are the main domains that have

317
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:47,850
been attacked these are the recipients

318
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:54,240
so this one suffered have significant

319
00:17:47,850 --> 00:18:00,600
campaign from the UK and then this one

320
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:03,590
also suffered significant now if we go

321
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:09,719
back to countries the UK and France the

322
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:12,840
winners in terms of emails to these

323
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:17,430
public sources and then here we see the

324
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,639
users looking at total virus the thing

325
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,920
about it users is very interesting

326
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,460
because it is not only you knowing who

327
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,390
is launching that attack but then you

328
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,130
take it from there

329
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,190
and then you can play around with that

330
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:36,240
specific user so if a specific user is

331
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:39,600
uploading to your public source emails

332
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,670
from government and you can push a

333
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,830
button because this is an interactive

334
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,280
platform when you click on the user you

335
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,220
can

336
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,160
what everything that that user has

337
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:53,040
uploaded whether it is a web account or

338
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,080
the API person it's uploading government

339
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,030
emails everything that you will find

340
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,939
there for that specific user will be

341
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:02,280
very interesting at the end of the day

342
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:06,090
the Pyrenees becomes really interesting

343
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:09,750
so this has zero detections in total

344
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,030
virus 270 samples after your I did not

345
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,740
come in with any malware I'm saying that

346
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:17,129
prior I because this is interesting

347
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,380
because if I have to know that I will

348
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:23,250
have to see those that have had up until

349
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,140
one to four detection but I'm not going

350
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,660
to take a look at those that have had

351
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:31,890
like 40 detection so if something has

352
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:34,200
been missed is what happens when there

353
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:37,470
are zero two or three sections and that

354
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,550
may also be caused by false positive

355
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:44,370
these are the ranges of detection here

356
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:46,560
we should pay careful attention to this

357
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:50,250
one these other ones will have a low

358
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:55,950
rate of detection type of files as we've

359
00:19:50,250 --> 00:20:00,300
seen before in published part is obvious

360
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:04,410
that most of the attachments come in wet

361
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:07,200
files PDF files of zip files and then

362
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:11,940
the number of positives in total virus

363
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:15,990
this has cirrhosis have 182 here with

364
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,960
one detection only and then three

365
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:24,270
detection that's what you really want to

366
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:27,480
look into and now bringing together all

367
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:30,900
the analytics and data that we have been

368
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,350
happy email harsh what total vanishes

369
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:37,620
about our email we have the person who

370
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:41,429
senses as whole as well as the content

371
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:44,040
the subject we have analyzed through

372
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:48,650
total values through predictive citizens

373
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:52,409
group well five from Palo Alto and then

374
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:53,260
know about the content of that Marwa

375
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:57,040
were

376
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,480
it is connected to Luigi but all this

377
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,270
information that we get from the sandbox

378
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,430
when we bring it all together start

379
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,820
enough from the large-scale analytical

380
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:10,540
data and going deeper down to here we

381
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:14,250
end up having these specific

382
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,510
characteristics or unique

383
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,240
characteristics and we would like to

384
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:22,540
share some of them with you today

385
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,890
because we have found something that if

386
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,530
it is not brand-new

387
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:29,620
it is nearly brand-new because of the

388
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:31,420
techniques that have induced those who

389
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,840
are attacked we have found a malware

390
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,740
that is has been used to attack Vietnam

391
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,169
government

392
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:44,350
everything starts off with an email that

393
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:47,920
comes in with the attachment so you can

394
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:51,540
see here it was not analyzed through

395
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,940
total virus and if this was just

396
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,000
impossible for us to translate because

397
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,040
we are not good at translating

398
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,170
Vietnamese language and there well here

399
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,050
we see all these names and names of

400
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:07,990
silly sevens and then it said at the end

401
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:10,000
up your disposal orator service so these

402
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,490
are the different she about civil 17

403
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,010
civil servants functions and everything

404
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:19,000
starts off like that I'm here will be

405
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:25,360
see a high-level structure how the and

406
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,880
the behavior of these when we decompress

407
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:33,159
the file is simulated a dump but

408
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:36,040
actually was a hyperlink we analyzed the

409
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,290
file and where it took us to and this is

410
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,820
what we found inside of what is that

411
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:47,820
well we have two Asian which is quite a

412
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:51,040
bit listen technique that is very dark

413
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,620
as you can see this execution quite a

414
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,080
few skated and at the end of the day all

415
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:00,429
this is decoded in the memory so it

416
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,689
hasn't quite unnoticed pretty complex

417
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,500
they use environmental

418
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:08,720
they also use these that self here

419
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,809
substring of the environment variables

420
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,690
as well as loops when you see the loops

421
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:17,090
at the end of the day they construct

422
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,039
this set up a command and what was that

423
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:23,620
well something that was accepted in

424
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:26,570
PowerShell the powershell vomited and

425
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,370
accelerated Windows scripts that at the

426
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,279
end of the day destructive three files

427
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,209
ad code file for you to see oh it's a

428
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:37,760
Word document

429
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:43,000
then a legit is dollar dotnet to bypass

430
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:47,210
the app NACA protections and then a.net

431
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,470
that had covered in the memory to Fisk

432
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:56,590
Asia over five carving file a PowerShell

433
00:23:50,470 --> 00:24:02,270
applica bypass classic above this is not

434
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:05,750
any person behind it this is very well

435
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:08,570
built when you focus all attacks carried

436
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,460
out to the government you end up finding

437
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,309
interesting things such as this one this

438
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:20,320
is how we decoded this very first part

439
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:24,020
through five carving so it comes to here

440
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,779
so this is the tag which is extracted ie

441
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,760
X comes here and instructs all that this

442
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:31,940
is a PowerShell that we'll be putting

443
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:38,350
here into memory and to be later

444
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:41,149
executed when executed we may find these

445
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:44,209
here at the battery we see the execution

446
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:48,320
here solution of the Power Cell all

447
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:51,799
these comes from here okay and within

448
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:56,029
that script file we find interesting

449
00:24:51,799 --> 00:25:00,100
fins so the three files that we told you

450
00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:04,460
before that went before me read or

451
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:08,389
pretend in different ways this is how

452
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,700
these dotnet file was instructed later

453
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,730
on will tell you what they did with it

454
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,519
and

455
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:18,740
we could also see how they but I do with

456
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:22,230
the legit dotnet tool to assemble

457
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,960
darknets elements more about the script

458
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,500
so here we see persistence this is a

459
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,049
program tasks tries to do it in

460
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,260
different ways if it kind of do it one

461
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:36,480
way

462
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:39,149
try set different way so this is the

463
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,500
file that was generated the power chanel

464
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:44,939
and I just would like to stop here to

465
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,590
tell you more about it this is

466
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,760
interesting there having already some

467
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,918
publications about it

468
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,408
notice this they take these installer

469
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,820
and shall not find nothing so that does

470
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:59,340
nothing but then - you / you does last

471
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,899
you this installs the app when I first

472
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,549
saw it and what doesn't really make

473
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:03,899
sense

474
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:08,340
well doesn't really make sense to

475
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:12,000
execute my work telling it to and

476
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:16,500
install it so this is the manga the.net

477
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,850
malware that was vomited at the limit so

478
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,059
at the end of the day we threw a little

479
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:23,699
installer it executes anything that is

480
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:25,049
being used to bypass a blocker do you

481
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,940
know that there are several techniques

482
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:29,610
and they are all based on the same theme

483
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,090
that is to say to use an excel file

484
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:35,158
why place of window which is good one

485
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,980
well-known one so that there is no

486
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,679
problems rescind our with rooted DLL and

487
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,600
many different ways to do that but

488
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,450
interested fear yes that these

489
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:50,029
techniques have been seen around it is

490
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:53,669
quite recent parities imaginings now we

491
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:54,950
so we never seen it linked to or using

492
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:57,779
that mask

493
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,279
actually we've trying to find out

494
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:01,500
whether there were something like this

495
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,960
but we didn't find anything similar so

496
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,870
it is quite a novelty this is the dotnet

497
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,419
that will be executed through the slash

498
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:12,870
year that I showed you before and then

499
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:17,250
when enhancing it is this payload which

500
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:22,820
is just base 64 I'll show you now what

501
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,820
it does so get that base 64

502
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,750
and then does memory space allocation

503
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,899
gets blob brings it over here and then

504
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:35,980
creates a thread that is executed in

505
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:38,140
memory what was interesting bit here if

506
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,990
you take a look at this process this is

507
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:47,260
the exact how come was this dick

508
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:49,390
executed if it was the command was to

509
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,250
and install it but they have created a

510
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:54,970
function which was an instance that was

511
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:59,140
being exported so when a query was made

512
00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:02,919
these nets this dotnet he said DLL when

513
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:05,440
you call a DLL do you give it the

514
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,919
function you want to started it to start

515
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,260
with it was asking it to install and

516
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:13,270
install at the end of the day execute

517
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,070
the payload we've seen similar things

518
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,929
but we never seen anything like this

519
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:21,750
before

520
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:25,320
decoding this payload well make look

521
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:30,460
simple it was a well by 64 duty codes

522
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:36,370
then you add binary and that's it no but

523
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:38,650
it was not a simplest as it was used in

524
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:41,260
the byte array and this was not thought

525
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,240
to include it in the file but to send it

526
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,210
right away to the memory for that we her

527
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:51,850
to write it script to process it so that

528
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:54,669
we would end up in the binary and to

529
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:58,809
play around with it then when we started

530
00:28:54,669 --> 00:29:00,850
it was life it was life upon planning

531
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,649
and then if we take a look at the

532
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:08,469
communication parameters I'm sure you

533
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:11,919
are aware of this this is cobalt very

534
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,470
easy to detect it when then when you

535
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,679
find other things and also what

536
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,450
reversing it is really crazy because of

537
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,460
the DNA's in the memory that will be

538
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,309
used and it will download another file

539
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:28,030
so reversing cobalt or device in this

540
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:29,470
sample is quite complicated let us see

541
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,590
if we have found something which is

542
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,170
actually good or not well this is the

543
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,909
thing

544
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:41,140
cooler yes it was kind of unique because

545
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:45,400
there were only few links with that IP

546
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:48,760
so the only links with the IP were

547
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:56,450
previous attempts but much less

548
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:58,910
sophisticated so this and okay a file

549
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:02,200
was being used and this is not processed

550
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:05,150
by the sandbox so they are already

551
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,460
bypassing the fast scanning and as you

552
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:10,190
seen before total virus it had not

553
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:14,030
detected it either because in these days

554
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,980
amazing machine learning diary we

555
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:18,379
analyzed macro but in this case there

556
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:22,490
was no macro so at the end of the day

557
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:28,760
singularity so the NSA why is this all

558
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:33,010
failing let us find the reason why okay

559
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,010
good now we move on to completions

560
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,750
hunting platform we can just go deeper

561
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:44,690
and deeper and reach out or get through

562
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,590
some samples or actors that are

563
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,080
relevance

564
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:50,179
well these bar continues to be active as

565
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:55,360
a known for how long you will continue

566
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:58,300
to be active and then the recipient was

567
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,709
members of the Vietnam government

568
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,440
conclusions email continues to be

569
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:06,860
nowadays one of the main vectors are of

570
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,250
attack vectors of entry for all the

571
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:14,300
organizations even including

572
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:16,180
government's so many of the emails that

573
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,010
we may find in open sources are

574
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:22,280
processed and can also be the sources

575
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:26,150
for information or data leak they are

576
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,550
accessible to anyone and if someone

577
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:32,660
sends in to customer to another person

578
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:36,169
from email very easy to steal also there

579
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:41,030
is another technique to patent notices

580
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:42,820
to encrypt the macro so these mechanism

581
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:45,310
allows you to bypass many system

582
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:48,010
the variety of mobile that we have found

583
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:51,429
here from several emails have been quite

584
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,950
wide and quite prevalent as well and

585
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:57,310
then the techniques that we have

586
00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:03,630
detected having also knew as well as

587
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:08,409
wide range so zipped attached file

588
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:10,900
attachments with password and once I

589
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:13,450
remember when I talked to Seth - a

590
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:16,480
self-help but this has not been detected

591
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:21,580
after Wigan is over to him and he said

592
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:26,080
well you didn't take a look at the total

593
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:29,939
virus it is an exploit from 2017 and I

594
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:34,510
said well sorry I didn't know that and

595
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,610
bypass off at loca attackers are

596
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:40,150
devoting quite a lot of some an effort

597
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:45,850
to pass unnoticed rather than devoting

598
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:48,340
time to developing new malware the

599
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:50,860
infrastructure and the way of placing or

600
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,980
sending in the malware to the recipient

601
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:56,080
is aimed at it passing unnoticed to

602
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,560
detection system and to network systems

603
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,600
we feel that endpoint is becoming more

604
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,480
and more relevant and more and more

605
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:08,939
important because of this type of

606
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,990
situation homeless situation

607
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,730
acknowledgments I would like to thank

608
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:17,260
and Wanda Monica on Monday they were

609
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,240
playing around with the program web do

610
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,540
you know that from 6 to 8 so I go to

611
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:33,850
Capitol radio I would like to and thank

612
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:36,250
them for them alright just in this

613
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:38,199
presentation but starting by that the

614
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:43,700
audio team who worked really hard to

615
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:48,740
have our platform 100% the innovation

616
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:51,080
of malaga with circular called my toy

617
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:55,040
factory they do things for me to have

618
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:59,810
fun with Jose and Daniel thank you and

619
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:02,510
also the to Sergio the big fish and the

620
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:05,480
pack we also I had people who have two

621
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:09,710
slots Cosimo's I know Alejandro with me

622
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:20,300
people can help us to become my reality

623
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:27,470
and crucial we secondary I would like to

624
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:31,270
thank particularly to Tony for days like

625
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:35,948
to go and have some fun with these toys

626
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:45,737
so I hope this was interesting for you

627
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:45,738
[Applause]

628
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,510
sabes que para las preguntas tienes que

629
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:55,450
poner en los microphone oohs eno via

630
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:59,950
meant a a Patino yeah the Vietnam thing

631
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:02,299
do you have any actors there singled out

632
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,339
right now it's a bit difficult the thing

633
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:10,460
is that it is such a unique thing that

634
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:14,630
we started looking for how this happened

635
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:18,610
there we found very little when we have

636
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:21,670
an apt this happens a lot but

637
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:24,070
in the case of Vietnam you can't really

638
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,830
say anything because it can be just

639
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:31,570
hypothetical because maybe it's an NSA

640
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:33,730
the Chinese the Russians with this

641
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:38,410
platform we can play a lot more or we

642
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:41,020
can do many things and join the dots for

643
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:43,660
analysis this is important to join the

644
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:47,530
dots so from here we will continue to

645
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:49,660
play with the indicators this TTT P

646
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:55,830
which is quite unique and let's see what

647
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:58,810
happens we'll have a new sample style so

648
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:01,660
as my colleague said it is difficult to

649
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:05,529
make sure of this and see how this will

650
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:08,140
work out anyway questions don't be

651
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:12,520
chickens get in the queue to make

652
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:15,069
questions I have another one for you so

653
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,360
there was text in Vietnamese did you

654
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:22,810
consider to use an add-on for the tool

655
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:28,320
that when you find text related to TTP

656
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:31,180
can make search in local media to find

657
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,160
coincidences that's a very good idea we

658
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,520
hadn't thought of it within the bodies

659
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,589
what you look are other types of attack

660
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,410
it's more like fishing kind of thing you

661
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:44,680
look name of banks companies and you

662
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,240
look for it within the bodies and we've

663
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,140
got a lot of fish in there but we hadn't

664
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,649
really thought of adding this plug in

665
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:57,580
previous campaign or associations I want

666
00:36:53,650 --> 00:37:01,010
my royalties on any question come on

667
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:03,690
this is a very interesting presentation

668
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:08,470
[Laughter]

669
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:11,770
no Jim I will see to tell you how much

670
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:16,060
you have to pay me let's see how it goes

671
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:18,670
out okay two things what how did you

672
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:22,960
obtain those zeros did you pick them out

673
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:25,900
throw an app because when I upload file

674
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,320
total virus the subscribers can read it

675
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,180
second is

676
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,880
servus got to be offered to the public

677
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:37,730
through pages to send files canons etc

678
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:43,730
okay the question one everything that

679
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:46,700
you upload to virustotal can be seen and

680
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:49,580
they can get information from that we

681
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:57,290
also have particular information sources

682
00:37:49,580 --> 00:38:01,040
from the CTA of telefónica look in boxes

683
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:07,310
to find things and for the second I'm

684
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:09,440
sorry it's ok official product ok that

685
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,650
you told us about will be a product

686
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,810
where you can subscribe you have one of

687
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,520
the parts that is public and we will see

688
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:19,820
you how we fit this in in the server

689
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:22,730
intelligence services of telefónica we

690
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:25,190
already have times for our cyber service

691
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:27,250
and this would be another engine that

692
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,750
will help us to detect more fishing

693
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:32,900
possible man were information leaks

694
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:35,350
things that end up in public Souls and

695
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:40,310
we haven't focused very much on email

696
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:42,290
because it's very good feeling but in

697
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:45,710
the beginning of the presentation we

698
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:49,340
used email functionalities not only for

699
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:51,890
even there were many windows 32 so we

700
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:54,110
will continue to work in analyze and

701
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,600
this is something that will most likely

702
00:38:54,110 --> 00:39:05,240
make available to our clients in the

703
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:06,950
future thank you very much if you don't

704
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,759
want to expose yourself to the world you

705
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:20,870
don't have to upload the father all the

706
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:23,160
file just - so - you can seed teasers to

707
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:26,700
identify actors

708
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:35,339
you can select a list of targets from a

709
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:38,960
large database throw a sort of a bone to

710
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:43,680
see if they if they if they pick it up

711
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,720
yes it's part of a consultant that it

712
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:52,730
sends me many emails in a short period

713
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:52,730
of time like 75% b2b the rest of

714
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:59,550
entities we can do many many things we

715
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:02,460
just brought one use case of everything

716
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:05,300
that you can embed but you have seen

717
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:08,820
that the possibilities of embedding are

718
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:13,530
amazing last question

719
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:23,040
no no you can't yeah talking about

720
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:29,670
add-ons to make an extension for

721
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:32,400
browsing could check this is a question

722
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:35,040
related to the audio with the are you

723
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,480
and you not only have the API and the

724
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,259
website to upload things you have a

725
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,390
plug-in that you can use to decide if

726
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,550
you want to send a back row because you

727
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,089
don't send the father that's why we like

728
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:49,860
the idea of the idea because not missing

729
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:52,260
confidentiality not infringing it you're

730
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:55,710
not sending all the files like every

731
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,560
rows total you just sent a macro so here

732
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:03,050
we have a part weight where there's a

733
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:06,060
computer document to collect a macro

734
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:09,060
this is only for the machine learning

735
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:11,600
what you've seen that the percentage of

736
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,600
PDFs

737
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:19,629
computer finds that 8090 percent of

738
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:19,630
everything that is attached to emails

739
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,680
