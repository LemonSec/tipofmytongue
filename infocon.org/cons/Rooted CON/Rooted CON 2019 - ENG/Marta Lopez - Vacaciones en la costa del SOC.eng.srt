1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,940
hi first of all thank you much for being

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,340
here these very early time in the

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,170
morning on Saturday we all know that how

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,639
cousin of I going out or alcohol of

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,070
making the most of three bars

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,830
I am monolith I'm a security analyst and

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,039
I'm here because in the last edition of

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:28,740
Navajo Negra some colleagues saw me they

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:32,040
thought you not no security analyst in

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,890
correlation the money transaction or

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,660
monitoring so I decided Malcolm

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,829
sensation to talk about what we do on a

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,550
daily basis and I decided to drop these

14
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:47,579
this presentation

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:53,780
podracing cost of a soul because my

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:58,920
former company you are from I think well

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:00,809
concept of SOC and there you can not

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,680
really be lazy because we have a lot of

19
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,390
work and you're not in the Sun like that

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,460
because according to regulation we

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:16,170
usually work we in windowless rooms that

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,758
is rule ISO 27000 there is some four

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,770
basic pillars risk analysis best

24
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,159
practices and continuous improvement of

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,220
these regulation the first part will be

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,460
honest or 27000 which is a tossing of

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:36,520
terms an interruption to the rule and 27

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:40,690
the certifiable part of me his family of

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:46,509
27,000 then 27000 M 2 which is a

30
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:50,289
reference guide to 35 in 27 w1 so 27

31
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:52,150
that we are wrong inclination 27 double

32
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:57,880
one that makes it survival

33
00:01:52,150 --> 00:02:01,150
so a SOC is Fisto facility where we keep

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,908
the holy triad of integrity we deal with

35
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:08,289
my triple rating protecting different

36
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:10,989
companies and we have different

37
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:19,208
departments we can divide three large

38
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:24,190
blocks to begin talking about prevention

39
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:26,320
guys ethical heart keen on its code

40
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,260
system service infrastructure and so on

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,209
and also doing intrusion tests if

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:37,720
customers do not have the wrong team

43
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:41,049
over there - terrible team here swing

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,269
trucking compilation analyses of the

45
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:45,660
data they found it on the internet in

46
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:45,660
Deep Web

47
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,750
avoid problems of forgeries from

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,459
reputation and we also deal with a

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,550
monitoring and managers were of

50
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:59,300
vulnerabilities from these types of

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,819
analyses so that practically we can have

52
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,030
incident detection that will help us

53
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:07,099
carry on how to shop bombs the second

54
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,630
part would be detection and that's where

55
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:13,280
we deal with 24/7 monitoring of all

56
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,250
systems we also attacked all the threats

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,599
they do really ventilation ducts relief

58
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:24,410
right now and of course we also deal

59
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:29,988
with the unties response than their

60
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:31,609
power fartist corruption massive dies

61
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,400
and the audit and when we apply the

62
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,709
corruption that we have seen in the to

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,680
form apartments you will also have a

64
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:43,370
path of technical consultancy we can

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,049
give these guys a hand to go through a

66
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,049
relation such as 27 or 1

67
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:56,640
and I created his presentation just put

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:03,990
this give him another before but these

69
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:07,649
was my only target to be here siem is a

70
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:14,810
merger of two elements and until 2005

71
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,810
were pretty separately we merge as I am

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:26,340
with SEM when she's a mutant collation

73
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:32,730
representations of events and the SE psi

74
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:35,039
M was correct in 2005 report by the

75
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,510
garnet company in this first time during

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:44,070
a single tool they merge these formally

77
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:47,099
separated tools so this inside a siem

78
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:52,680
very illogical scheme there is some two

79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:54,410
types of entry later or importation

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,610
alligator

81
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,040
what those other ones are we get through

82
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,220
the SI yen and we also how the context

83
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,370
likes what we have

84
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,770
is camera user information assets

85
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,980
information and all the intelligence

86
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:18,719
fields that field logical scheme of the

87
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:25,170
si n inputs mvsim works his magic return

88
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,900
smart books so was a magic compiled by

89
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,370
the yes I am

90
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,039
well not magic supplied through three

91
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,440
points and splitting the three logical

92
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,500
parts which are recollection correlation

93
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:44,640
and load them in my storage so we begin

94
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:46,980
with imports or the logs to the si n for

95
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,219
me to collect them yes I am half an

96
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:56,880
octave part regarding lock collection if

97
00:05:50,220 --> 00:06:00,960
it does the consultations from data si

98
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:05,250
Affairs um hi or the collect these logs

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:09,210
through as or a simply I'm PC mighty of

100
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,070
sanding we use they 24/7 part in the

101
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:18,289
will of time on three but if initial

102
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:18,290
monitoring or areas may have

103
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,680
massive part his antlers his lot origins

104
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,750
even though aliens usually work a lot of

105
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,450
loose Islam and will assist novices that

106
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:41,600
we say de facto standard into Lysander's

107
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:44,190
3160 forums analyzing thereof see 54:24

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,980
54:26 depending on the transport layer

109
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:50,820
which operates it usually works with

110
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,020
promotes by 514 disability people in all

111
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,140

[Music]

113
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:05,780
2514 60 1514 and this is using all our

114
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:09,120
network devices and also munis unix and

115
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,580
lighting systems in Windows it does not

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,670
appear natively we have many tools that

117
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:18,990
can get these logs and send them through

118
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,680
system so the syslog messages are quite

119
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,280
simple

120
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,020
they have priority have enough text

121
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:29,000
Jesus built in elevates the fare see

122
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,000
bits of this part here which is a parity

123
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:39,328
and then we have the other five bits

124
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:42,149
as part of the resource code we can see

125
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:45,929
the type of source unbound by log -

126
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:47,429
these numerical code sort of

127
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:52,948
differential treatment of logs will

128
00:07:47,429 --> 00:08:02,248
receive we have the error include all

129
00:07:52,949 --> 00:08:06,659
the sex part to include the actual love

130
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:08,879
sand by the source another way of

131
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,889
getting largest rodents which are a

132
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,639
small software possum and I solved

133
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:18,110
without machine machine that works about

134
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:22,729
centralizer and the sound of the logs

135
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,729
interested for that works collection

136
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:33,060
police agents may be free or private and

137
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:36,679
they're usually geared to versus or to

138
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:39,299
the sea we go back to Windows we have

139
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:43,079
different identities as an air and Cora

140
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:45,650
log even though we have others depending

141
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,650
on the

142
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,550
some technology may have outside or a

143
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:57,650
curator connector these agents do very

144
00:08:52,550 --> 00:09:01,520
important such as parsing massage

145
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:05,449
translation even though if we are naked

146
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,520
class environment source the origin

147
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,240
source or the server can do that the

148
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,220
physics H is passing is my dance a lot

149
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,110
of syntactic analysis and it's like a

150
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,800
school when you get into sentence you

151
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,810
need to say the subject predicate direct

152
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,719
direct object and this same thing along

153
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,150
in determining whether is from of our

154
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,870
world may have the or in IPS I should IP

155
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:33,020
the portrait traffic goes through these

156
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,300
windows have useful the use of the

157
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,160
validation DC and so on this analysis

158
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,000
about it split in differently

159
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,260
he feels through regular expressions

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,410
it's very important for these to be

161
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:54,939
simple enough to avoid overload in our

162
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:59,390
server well you have to normalization

163
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,950
which is live this pronto cm a resources

164
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,740
speaks a different language and dr.

165
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,200
natural correlator he them always to

166
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,950
speak the same language that is a

167
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,980
normalization all the logs receive so

168
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,220
there is how you feel the summarization

169
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,649
depending on the manufacturer they

170
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,120
pictured them differently I'm going to

171
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:22,339
paint them on in the same way where we

172
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,860
have that whatever see they see and

173
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,720
he'll may have certain custom fields and

174
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,630
depending on this on the different

175
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,680
manufacturers just for firewalls may be

176
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,689
applying upper layers and here we have

177
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,209
data we need to collect to be able to

178
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,209
correlate them are you bored

179
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:46,880
but then we will go to the cognitive -

180
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,910
actual stage applause and he replied

181
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,920
times to go usually according to the

182
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,170
actions done by these different bombs

183
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,329
for something these are flammable events

184
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:00,889
and we have accepted traffic or deny

185
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:03,319
traffic or advance me Harvick electronic

186

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:17,540
come from windows online or VPN all of

188
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:21,199
these to launch a query to the database

189
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:25,209
so that we do not overload the system at

190
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:25,209
the stage here is the aggregation stage

191
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,199
this is a to optimizer storage and the

192
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:36,769
license part there we'll see later how

193
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:38,779
it works so what is event a new agent

194
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,740
but it's about getting a series of locks

195
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,689
are exactly the same

196
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,120
oh you're French I did my favorite time

197
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:47,269
started so group fun affairs want to the

198
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,310
last one we count the number of logs you

199
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,960
saying

200
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:57,689
and correlated by the time stumbled last

201
00:11:51,960 --> 00:12:00,150
about when you factor I might see the

202
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,480
first we typically time sums but that

203
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:06,360
depends on the same we're breaking some

204
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:13,860
Sidon do not use the segregation because

205
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:15,630
he doesn't make sense working does not

206
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,730
work with event emulation for example or

207
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:28,140
curator how's the flow management

208
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:30,810
abilities optimized enough do some very

209
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,840
important associative here we're gonna

210
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:36,510
split Lily from elements all of the

211
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,970
events of resources that are going to

212
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:46,130
sample their lives we do not need it all

213
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:48,810
on the logs now assessing this maze bhi

214
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:51,720
from the source or from the agency some

215
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:56,160
gloves so then we do not overload the

216
00:12:51,720 --> 00:13:00,620
server receive them then we'll go to the

217
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,620
correlation stage which is where we live

218
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,430
you can also different notifications and

219
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,720
at the beginning of analysis and

220
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:42,319
searches and Lavagirl take into account

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:45,170
the VCS a temporary storage doing the

222
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,600
consultation I need to be quick

223
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:53,180
so if we have lots of data stored here

224
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:56,690
we lose the short-term perspective we

225
00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:01,819
need to make a conveyance way to

226

time to try to look for things in

different other functions in this layer

[Music]

238
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,319
we'll see a series of owner abilities we

239
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,680
have within the system to prioritize

240
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,640
them the monetary part example let's say

241
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,979
we have some sort of magazine some tool

242
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:49,410
that my wonders of touch or some old

243
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:52,470
system that no one dares to alter so we

244
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:55,829
can have a specific between these all

245
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,540
systems treat them with more power this

246
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:08,100
can also be applied to using Scala

247
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:10,260
systems or other solar systems from all

248
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,070
the laws you see so you kind of get the

249
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:17,760
flare where all the traffic is going

250
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:20,310
through and you can kind of depicted not

251
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,460
in a reliable way but you can get an

252
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,239
idea of a network of the customer

we talked anomalies Maltese and help our

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,510
clients regarding tone shooting because

256
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,430
we are the ones we lost our database is

257
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:41,100
much more than that we can usually help

258
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:43,859
when they have something they can see of

00:16:52,290 --> 00:17:01,529
the use of control companies is quite

263
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:03,420
important route force attacks don't talk

264
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:06,390
about that later and depending on the

265
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:10,520
companies they use a lot see it was for

266

regulation whether it's for air so ax

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:33,780
from cm we can also help to comply

helpline is shortened but I was in the

269
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,460
long term we can see some other

270
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:51,000
data to calculate DPS so once we know

271
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:53,820
policy words when I briefly explained

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,700
how the implementation stage of that

important to have a Google Form and

275
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:15,780
taken taken stage will know all the

276
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:33,379
economic activity and why they all this

277
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:36,840
information the idea

278
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:40,200
areas even though we solve the same

279
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:43,490
manufacturers in different cases the end

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,490
result will be totally

282
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,840
the business to know about the services

283
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:58,090
we can give to customers is very

284
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:00,009
important to the SATA collection we're

285
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,799
also going to the complain assess damage

286
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:05,710
we need to know exactly which regulation

287
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,379
does it fun to have because very often

288
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:12,009
all these edification regulation was to

289
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:21,149
of love sometimes maybe a bit more

290
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:21,149
complex to offer a solution is to do

291
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,019
song it's certainly have a reference

292
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:30,689
point to the beginning with us also very

293
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:35,169
important and our other data sources

294
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:38,039
belongs us about the devices were going

295
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:40,149
to monitor mainly due to compatibility

296
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:51,609
sometimes we need to do around

297
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:54,580
development usually this pump you can

298
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:58,269
also offer value if you know the company

299
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,970
if they know either use wrong tool which

300
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:04,200
one please work offering specific

301
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,200
monitoring for these two

302
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:10,860
it's also very important to know whether

303
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:13,649
this company has critical resources I

304
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,260
need some sort of beyond a specific or

305
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:20,850
tank production maybe they have medical

306
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:24,090
data only there is some sort of specific

307
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:28,439
storage or if we go back to legacy

308
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:30,470
systems dinosaurs or many companies

309
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,080
what are you talking about bunkie

310
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:35,240
because they have Swift systems and

311
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,799
networks

312
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:44,520
a bit more of TLC and we need to take

313
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:47,250
money to account software course the

314
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,710
costs of the same license where they

315
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,659
would have it an appliance or whether we

316
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,640
need to solve even takings well the

317
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:57,240
network or they will achieve a specific

318
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:02,419
unit unit for the applications and also

319
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,419
see whether we need some sort of digital

320
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:10,799
certificate flyers to buy a compatible

321
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:15,560
server we also need to take into account

322
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,990
the storage part as well as well

323
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,470
[Music]

324
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:33,340
and data center classes and of course we

325
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:39,640
need to a try surfing club centralizer

326
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:43,928
to the actual server with Bangkok by the

327
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,510
database and so on so once we have a big

328
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:48,640
team phase we need to get these sort of

329
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:54,730
an architecture and transfer it directly

330
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:59,620
to your physical an example is image

331
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:02,230
from we can see the different sources

332
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,500
that are belongs the concentrator in

333
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,809
this answer the server deals with

334
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:13,240
correlation stage and then long-term

335
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:16,090
storage which will be a longer yeah we

336
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:22,919
get to one of the most important

337
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:25,629
elements in the system which is powerful

338
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,130
but when you take into account all the

339
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,659
logs are gonna be speak louder from

340
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:33,510
systems and that works in development

341
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:35,790
you calculate all the events per second

342
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:39,360
gigabytes a good day

343
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,920
never get chewed off and here break into

344
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,030
comedy societies were important because

345
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:46,770
we need to apply growth to the seal that

346
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,250
allows us to ask alight it in a couple

347
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,250
of years

348
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,960
for example ICM is not our tent here

349
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,360
project when you get to the Casa de

350
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,020
Vicki's you forget about it isn't a lot

351
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:02,820
of project is a service began a certain

352
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:05,610
point in the chain so we need to have

353
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:11,450
this capability because a customer may

354
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:14,300
want to our resources to do more changes

355
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:18,710
that do not represent a drastic problem

356
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:20,419
so to say and once we get to this point

357
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,690
for the lot Olivia to the actual

358
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:30,440
insulation machine vision software

359
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:39,680
solution in the correlation say -

360
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:44,380
overseas deployment a team so HIV to

361
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,380
intervene retention backup configuration

362
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:52,580
we go to this point we need to do these

363
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,630
three basic checkmarks other longer - if

364
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,080
directly yes

365
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:59,480
can the reports be exported yes our

366
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,639
search is giving me house but the data

367
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,340
we can use well he would fly thousands

368
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:09,470
who use cases animation at the end to

369
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:11,209
take a few photos these leads to

370
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,420
continuous improvement improvements

371
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:16,460
through reviews give the customer pollen

372
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:25,490
remedy violence they need to be directed

373
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:33,290
with so see him a survived entity that

374
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:35,870
we need to improve from creatures in the

375
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:39,350
market it is sometimes complex to decide

376
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:42,729
one or the other visual solution you see

377
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:55,600
master were so compliance

378
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:56,720
here's a picture but we see he's got

379
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:03,020
company

380
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:06,320
market research everyone doing is

381
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,059
basically so not just a lot you see him

382
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,668
but they take lots of technologies into

383
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:12,860
a complex analysis and they plays Amica

384
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:16,090
quadrant with four corners you have the

385
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,918
leaders patatoes

386
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:24,830
the visionaries the hover with products

387
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:29,529
and then each player's doing the wrong

388
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,529
thing because the product is not yet

389
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:41,439
development we have manufacturers this

390
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,440
is quite relevant but this plum guy's

391
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:54,050
hands repeat is blessing visionaries

392
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:56,000
actually we can also see that issues

393
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,310
like fire I have disappearing massacre

394
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,550
onyx has gone from vision directly to

395
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:09,950
leaders without going through

396
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:12,710
competitors these report costs about one

397
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:20,810
thousand euros but if you do a couple of

398
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:22,040
searches in Google you may find it for

399
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,139
personal data

400
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,870
come on our curator is beautiful for

401
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,780
March mad and not William is quite cool

402
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,550
with graphic interfaces and I'm not

403
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,580
gonna deal with this for too long

404
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:37,430
because it's not too relevant it depends

405
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:40,490
on your company's basically let's go to

406
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:43,130
a part of the procedure which is

407
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:46,640
intelligent easy analysis rules he used

408
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:49,450
axes of research that the most important

409
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,800
part of CMS is here

410
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:57,640
if you see does not get inspired we have

411
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,870
lots of logs and just block things that

412
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,630
is useless

413
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,629
so how do we apply these intelligence

414
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:13,000
and to different sources so we generate

415
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:15,910
a series of correlation events which are

416
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,240
the starting points for incident

417
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:23,200
management and this is were analyst life

418
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:28,020
I won't talk about our Delhi with what

419
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,020
do we actually do what is analogous to

420
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:36,490
know we do copy base my little file the

421
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,260
realizer here it is not explained what

422
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:52,990
we actually do what are the bases at

423
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:54,730
work so if you write to me through

424
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,920
linking and I think a few days to answer

425
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,920
but what does one need to at least

426
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:12,410
to have solid knowledge with our

427
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:14,360
existence to be a great programmer but

428
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,540
you do need to know these parts quite

429
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,639
well because we read logs of their bases

430
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,040
you'll need to know well the function of

431
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,559
everything here tomorrow ever see I've

432
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:31,040
given though then we might be reading

433
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:34,040
there of C's for time but please notice

434
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,440
like we are the levels find hard with

435
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:40,309
boundaries on databases and the other

436
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:44,480
ones we have sautéed very often our

437
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:47,470
project can be distressing what do we do

438
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,929
to manage the stress of my Darfur work

439
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:54,290
sometimes is quite high

440
00:28:49,929 --> 00:29:03,700
well no team we apply the so called SOC

441
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:12,409
is then a comfort system with loads of

442
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:15,950
users plus see there's nothing that

443
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:18,620
makes me more angry than losers they're

444
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:21,290
horrible people that just made your life

445
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,719
very difficult and use when I took them

446
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:26,210
directly so hard a great guy which is

447
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,679
Eduardo and I used to read his blog

448
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:32,390
because I thought it was really funny

449
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:34,550
at some point one of decided to apply

450
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,830
with this guy they call the so called

451
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,780
BofA age exam which is taking life

452
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,928
easily taking a step back

453
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:43,070
breathing deeply twice and not kill them

454
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:47,630
in their life

455
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:49,460
because its whole new science so getting

456
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:52,850
this idea plug you directly to their

457
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:55,190
saucy ideas because as I would say our

458
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:58,969
work sometimes might be extremely

459
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:00,890
stressful and we applied the socket set

460
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,680
and what is that well to take a step

461
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:06,560
back to breathe calmly a couple of times

462
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,450
and then start reading this looks why do

463
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,700
we have the estrangement because we have

464
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:14,990
complex and other things that we don't

465
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:21,080
know where they come from often because

466
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:22,970
of the essays which can be a pain let's

467
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:28,490
acknowledge that because your father's

468
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:30,470
the one who's actually I bothers up

469
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,570
there but it's not nothing personal I'm

470
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,020
not referring to you but often it is

471
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:38,060
about who is in the pain and I

472
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:41,000
acknowledge that I was in one project

473
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:43,700
not in this one he's a great guy but I

474
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,860
participated in a project in which the

475
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,290
operations of the company was one thing

476
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,540
and the customer apparatus was a

477
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:54,110
different one and whatever you did you

478
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:56,030
were going to to get it wrong and you

479
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:58,550
were going to be sculpted either on one

480
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:03,379
sided or from both sides so a little

481
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:07,280
work in in a sock you need a common

482
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:11,980
person and to be patient because often

483
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,980
the bad guys insult us all the time

484
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:23,150
you always they always finish their

485
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:27,549
messages by saying thank you in general

486
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:30,890
what we do as analysts still be people

487
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:35,230
not panic at the first opportunity

488
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:35,230
because it doesn't make any sense to

489
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,840
overwhelm so quickly one of the big

490
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:44,690
problems we have are the clothes and I

491
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,760
think that has happened in all projects

492
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:49,990
that I've been involved in each analyst

493
00:31:46,760 --> 00:32:01,549
has its own methodology and each one

494
00:31:49,990 --> 00:32:03,549
defines how the oceans can be like with

495
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:07,700
the triggers of the different corners

496
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:11,139
but they are not a threat for security

497
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:16,179
and these false positives they happen

498
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:20,020
continuously then we apply an adjustment

499
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:23,270
so that they don't they stop sort of

500
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:26,480
triggering but the positives are those

501
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:30,918
events that are materially but are not a

502
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,400
threat but the positives with impact

503
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,770
that also happens that blood gets

504
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,080
through every whereas with a promise and

505
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:42,290
a positive without impact could be the

506
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,149
scarring of the perimeter Network and a

507
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:49,159
positive with impact that would require

508
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:51,590
a more thorough investigation would be

509
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,730
that a previous role of a perimeter

510
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:58,909
scanner with access to 422 la I'm not

511
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:02,690
going to go into how important it is

512
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,650
this issue with a port with access from

513
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,600
internet and

514
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,080
the false negatives when there is a

515
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,449
threat that there's been no correlation

516
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,500
event and/or because the customer

517
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:18,710
himself requests some kind of an

518
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:21,140
investigation how do we get this one

519
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:24,260
date sometimes practically from the

520
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:27,290
customer panel usually they get this

521
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:30,290
requested walks through the correlation

522
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:32,420
event that each manufacturer calls it in

523
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:40,520
a different way some say I learned to

524
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:42,890
love the fans or grind you get this

525
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,710
correlation event well at the high level

526
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:48,590
would depend on the use cases what to

527
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:51,500
use case use case is the definition of

528
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:56,419
the root of the high level abstracting

529
00:33:51,500 --> 00:34:00,860
from the technologies that are in the

530
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:04,240
data sources are in the same itself with

531
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:06,800
the use cases what we do is we we define

532
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,649
the different threats that we want to

533
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:13,250
monitor everything that we want to have

534
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:19,219
a parametrized and once we are clear it

535
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:22,610
codifies depending on the SI and we get

536
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:25,310
to the rules and so it is this theme

537
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:27,940
that gives us a correlation events based

538
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,259
on the world and that depends on the

539
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,470
technologies and the sources and from

540
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,300
here on this correlation event generate

541
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:36,350
a number of actions that can be

542
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,290
automatic

543
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:44,089
first let's say sending of emails as

544
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:47,330
amazing reporting updating of black

545
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,730
lists or updating of scripts or the

546
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:51,940
manual actions which other ones we will

547
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:54,710
be in charge of where we start our

548
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:58,520
investigations their rules this the

549
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:01,340
correlation events get to us having seen

550
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,759
a number of triggers in the alert and

551
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:07,970
how do we get these alerts in the rules

552
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,720
while following a certain logic for any

553
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:15,020
Thursday it can be through flow the

554
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:21,529
or some anomaly that we perceive

555
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:23,359
directly we could also have this when

556
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,470
there's no event for instance when there

557
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,270
is a

558
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:35,020
warning saying this source has stopped

559
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:37,630
sending events we also have simple rooms

560
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:39,850
even only matches with a correlation

561
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:43,570
event or a complex rules if it matches

562
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:47,140
me so going back to the scanning a

563
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:51,370
simple one would be a simple scanning

564
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:53,910
and the of the MA and the complex one

565
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:57,130
would be that scanning plus the

566
00:35:53,910 --> 00:36:00,700
correlation and I'm speaking on

567
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:04,000
apologizes for speaking so fast the use

568
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,620
cases we can divide by category

569
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,750
depending on whether they are internal

570
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,210
attacks external attacks whether whether

571
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:17,760
there is denial of service etc in

572
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:23,080
between technologies there are IPS ideas

573
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,030
fw correlation or by the what's the

574
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:30,120
elements affected or the risks whether

575
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:30,120
it affects integrity confidentiality or

576
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:37,440
[Music]

577
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:41,129
so we start with the use cases I wanted

578
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,440
to divide them as best as I can and I

579
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:49,800
think the talk is always the follow-up

580
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:52,890
of users with top ones are they brute

581
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,560
force attacks that in the case of

582
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:59,279
Windows in doing a lot of follow-up of

583
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:03,980
the events for forty seven seventy one

584
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:07,260
that comes to the cavero side or the

585
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:09,990
4635 and where we would do a follow-up

586
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,450
of the possible brute force attacks or

587
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,220
dictionary attacks or the gentleman

588
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:17,819
that's trying to use the neighbors

589
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,770
password and going back to the

590
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,480
troubleshooting i've mentioned earlier

591
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:25,069
on it will also lead us to solve

592
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:28,500
problems in the different clients

593
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:31,650
recently we had a brute force attack

594
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,599
from cabarrus and and following the

595
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,640
hands of the different events we

596
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,579
determined that what had happened there

597
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,440
was a pretty long problem between the

598
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:43,109
NDP's of the different cases of this

599
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,390
customer i was generating problems in

600
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:47,339
the generation of cavernous area tickets

601
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,720
and it was generating many events of

602
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:53,310
brute force to this type of brute force

603
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,419
we have to see whether they're to do

604
00:37:53,310 --> 00:38:00,660
with it B and PS or VIP users or of

605
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,760
course I administer a tor systems of the

606
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,250
system or of the different machines that

607
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:10,579
the customers have so based on this type

608
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:13,770
of cases we can see lateral movements or

609
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:15,540
escalation of privileges and we can see

610
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:19,400
if somebody's trying to access resources

611
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,400
they have no permission for

612
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,670
through the user follow-up very often we

613
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,040
could see the four active way with a

614
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,810
Therese or some kind of leadership from

615
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,000
outside for instance if there's a guy

616
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:34,540
from a month marketing who was lifting

617
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,020
the users of the group that doesn't look

618
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:42,040
very good and you can check on that too

619
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:45,910
in the follow up of users in this type

620
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,980
of use case it's important here we have

621
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,200
to establish some thresholds and

622
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,000
sometimes it's hard to do to know

623
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,850
where's the rule and to be able to

624
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,160
establish the differences to start

625
00:38:53,850 --> 00:39:00,370
making the different investigations and

626
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,379
are very big stars in use cases that I

627
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:05,500
like a lot that I have a colleague who

628
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:08,380
hates them are the compromised equipment

629
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,400
we can make the texture of marklar in

630
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,400
many different ways

631
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:21,650
we can detect malware in many ways

632
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:25,538
because of the alert some types of the

633
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:29,150
anti anti virus because we've seen hot

634
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:34,150
in the imagine of a harsh because of the

635
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:36,709
behavior of the machine if we have the

636
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,329
memories that are completely collapse

637
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:41,448
for instance that could be a starting

638
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:44,089
point for research to know if we have

639
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:46,809
some type of malware installed in the

640
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:50,660
machine we can also see if there is

641
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:54,699
because of the output flow events first

642
00:39:50,660 --> 00:40:06,920
and in terms of communications with a

643
00:39:54,699 --> 00:40:09,469
known or machine measures to be able to

644
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,709
discard whether it is power or not first

645
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:15,289
that we are looking at the the

646
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:20,779
navigation of the proxy we can know if

647
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:23,869
they are in the listen web page or not

648
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:26,420
soul digger web page they make these

649
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:28,759
reorganized is leading to the

650
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,140
downloading of malware or software that

651
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:34,960
doesn't look so good

652
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:36,660
a few examples of this

653
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,690
[Music]

654
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,509
an interesting revenge was a TA or

655
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:47,550
research was a team that was connected

656
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:49,470
to an IP through very weird ports

657
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:53,760
because they're very any shots beginning

658
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:56,669
we only look at the look at the port of

659
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,860
me and then we had five high peers and

660
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,850
at that time he was on the that machine

661
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:06,570
trying to establish that connection

662
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:08,630
later on quite quickly it was not only

663
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:12,120
that machine but the other machines

664
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:22,830
there were a bunch of them making

665
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:25,680
requests to those IP so thousand for the

666
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:30,450
event of connection through one of those

667
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:33,690
I be through an exchange server we

668
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:36,120
managed to isolate it on time and it

669
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:38,640
turned out that it was a gentleman that

670
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:42,060
had taken a pendrive from home that was

671
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,980
infected and just by plugging it to the

672
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:50,400
computer or work he'd managed to infect

673
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:54,930
the exchange of a company you have to be

674
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:57,630
careful about that with the users and

675
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:59,970
what they can use you know return and

676
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:04,080
that works another example of this type

677
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:05,939
of malware wanna try two years after the

678
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,569
event we're still talking about it there

679
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:12,270
are customers who for whom would have

680
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:18,750
had to change the traffic and for the

681
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:20,610
for one for for a side and we don't know

682
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,550
which machines are doing this report

683
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:26,910
because they do not keep the logs of the

684
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:29,570
VMS of our customers so there are there

685
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:32,670
are also customers that not only know

686
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:35,990
that they have machine like legacy

687
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:38,880
machines that have a wanna cry installed

688
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:41,669
but nobody dares touching and you cannot

689
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,460
remove it from there because it is a

690
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,810
very critical machine and a critical

691
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,570
application and they have them

692
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:53,690
they're with their mother cry contained

693
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:56,940
in a little class box like a cyber

694
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,290
horrors museum pretty that we have in in

695
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,290
many of our customers

696
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:04,020
if we're lucky sometimes we are not

697
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:06,060
malware analysts ok I have to make that

698
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,270
clear but sometimes we get a sample of a

699
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:12,390
malware silly enough to to be executed

700
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:15,840
in a sample and we can do a contention

701
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:18,240
measure by knowing where they're trying

702
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:23,010
to collect they say my word I'm taking

703
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,959
too much time I think we also have to be

704
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:28,290
keep in mind when we look at this a

705
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,090
communications on the way out or what

706
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:34,259
we're trying to block because if you

707
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:37,380
have a pirate the sky you have to block

708
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,930
the bad eye peels but not Microsoft

709
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,550
although some of you would like to do so

710
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:44,250
but you have to realize that you cannot

711
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:46,680
block just indiscriminately because you

712
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:50,550
can't you can make a mess something I

713
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:54,899
really enjoy is change changes in the

714
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:57,360
system it's very important to have a

715
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,730
specific monitoring in critical servers

716
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:04,110
and systems and how do you do that we'll

717
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:08,400
see small or with similar tools I drank

718
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:11,670
so thanks of the sort and it is also

719
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,470
very important to monitoring of the

720
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,720
monitoring tool because this is the

721
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:19,279
first line of attack for the bad guys to

722
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:24,419
try to make a mess they do that through

723
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:27,720
services lists and using the driver 32

724
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,410
and if you have to monitor if we're

725
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,410
talking about this

726
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:40,729
why is it important to take care of this

727
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:43,569
month because there and see if there are

728
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:47,209
changes of register we could see

729
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:52,249
directly if there is somebody trying to

730
00:44:47,209 --> 00:44:53,959
execute them maybe cut and that's what

731
00:44:52,249 --> 00:44:56,390
is very trendy right now you can monitor

732
00:44:53,959 --> 00:45:03,649
that from salesmen we can see if there

733
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:06,109
are malicious a librarian of privileges

734
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:10,959
and then the other monitoring of logical

735
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:14,989
activities at the system level of course

736
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:16,669
IPS idea is we have to have everything

737
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:20,680
well monitored because they are an

738
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:23,059
important starting point for the

739
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,819
research or investigations that we're

740
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:28,519
going to perform they help us blog he

741
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:31,759
was talking about idea is the attacks of

742
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:35,538
the type SQL I think that were familiar

743
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:38,269
with and malicious traffic and we they

744
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:40,729
also help us in the detection of malware

745
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:42,258
because they have a recognized knowledge

746
00:45:40,729 --> 00:45:44,749
they have a number of signatures and

747
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:49,519
they generated for us correlation

748
00:45:44,749 --> 00:45:52,509
allergy Tran factor er the recognition

749
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:55,129
within mining machine learning virtual

750
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:56,299
sandboxes flow analysis behavior

751
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,229
analysis and so on

752
00:45:56,299 --> 00:46:03,199
for us it is an important starting point

753
00:45:59,229 --> 00:46:05,118
well we know that IP Isis we can get rid

754
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,759
of quite easily but if we apply the

755
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,799
Pareto principle to security with her

756
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:12,890
twenty percent of F are you going to

757
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:16,400
remove 80 percent of the security

758
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:19,038
problems and we're going to me and then

759
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,829
through the IPS and offerings where the

760
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:25,329
fire was the network anomalies help us a

761
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:25,329
lot of help us immensely

762
00:46:27,299 --> 00:46:33,299
these colors are very important because

763
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:36,910
we can notice and internal and external

764
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:38,950
scanning some suspicious behavior and if

765
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:41,500
you remember this guy from the pen drive

766
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:44,618
that I mentioned earlier everything

767
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,349
started with an excessive traffic of

768
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:50,520
fire will deny that was a going out and

769
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:54,190
another interesting case

770
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:56,640
thanks through the firewalls it was also

771
00:46:54,190 --> 00:47:00,579
outgoing traffic that was suspicious

772
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,200
outgoing traffic that was being denied

773
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:08,319
because it was a machine that was doing

774
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:09,640
DNS requests to inform ethernet/ip and

775
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:13,210
at the beginning we thought it was a

776
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:18,150
malware I was trying to get in touch

777
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:22,150
with some DNS malicious service to

778
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:25,140
direct official machine or still

779
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:30,040
passwords but looking a bit further

780
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:36,490
these were not DNS requests asking VP

781
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:40,630
but they were going to CP are used by

782
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:42,250
DMSO servers to make the zone transfer

783
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:44,650
with other server so it was quite

784
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,960
suspicious that a customers would be

785
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,780
trying to go out through that court I

786
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,579
was a guy who was trying to do data a

787
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,640
filter and have the come from the

788
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:56,920
company outside and you can imagine how

789
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,250
that ended and I was detected thanks to

790
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:05,180
the good configuration of the firewalls

791
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:11,779
another topic that could

792
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:13,940
we generate a complete talk at the entry

793
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:20,390
surface and where the bad guys are

794
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:24,770
always trying to access talk about it

795
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:28,038
because it but it is to say where I most

796
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:30,890
often say one of my stories they're

797
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:32,960
trying to do this so that's where you

798
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:36,440
can see them thinking and you realize

799
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,779
that even in effective security we're

800
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,099
always going next familiar to us because

801
00:48:38,779 --> 00:48:49,220
we're always behind the bad guys that's

802
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:51,140
we should we should be terrorized by

803
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:56,180
this but just be aware that that's how

804
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:58,578
it is then in cases like what I've

805
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:01,460
mentioned earlier on about the following

806
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:05,240
our monitoring of users and the

807
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:07,400
brute-force attacks and access and abuse

808
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,529
of privileges and other security

809
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,380
problems that used to be sort of Intel

810
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:15,440
and now we're taking to the cloud part

811
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,990
and of course the LPS which to me are

812
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,059
the worst but it's also part of our job

813
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:24,229
there's no alternative but doing it and

814
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:28,010
these are the LPS are leaks of

815
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:32,329
information they are usually using such

816
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:34,819
as McAfee where from a number of alerts

817
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:38,869
you can see they're trying to extract

818
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:41,779
DNA or credit card numbers of account

819
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:45,730
numbers or if they're sending in plain

820
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:49,240
text and data from users or applications

821
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:52,730
we also have potential reductions of

822
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:56,689
data like for instance we if we see

823
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:58,549
traffic in red store or we see a V and P

824
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:02,779
that's not the corporate one that

825
00:49:58,549 --> 00:50:05,000
sending encrypted traffic al flow or if

826
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:07,940
they're somebody who's accessing the

827
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,550
different storage servers in the in the

828
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,890
cloud if it's a second

829
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,870
we drop box with the drive with a cloud

830
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:21,290
they're trying to do something and I've

831
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:24,350
learned for the end this part not

832
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:27,050
because it's important but because we're

833
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:28,549
out it's quite well along everything

834
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:31,580
that comes from the fields

835
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:33,140
I think em BRR what I've said everyone

836
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,330
about the context danger that we

837
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:39,049
received these are these data they allow

838
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:41,690
us to have an IP reputation or web

839
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:44,630
reputation they allow us to categorize

840
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:48,170
the filtering of webs and the different

841
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:51,580
proxies and they also help us to defiled

842
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:54,170
reputation for malware detection to know

843
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:56,540
command and control all command and

844
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:59,180
cultural and new command and control

845
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:01,910
that's why it's important to have these

846
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,129
feeds updated everyday

847
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:07,609
there comes a point to don't worry I'm

848
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:10,700
almost done I've left here a list of all

849
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:15,610
the data that I've covered and I would

850
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:20,720
like to thank because one must always be

851
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:22,400
grateful I wanted to thank he's not here

852

853
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,400
person I trusted me he always told me it

854
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,500

855
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,080

870
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:17,720
webpage and because my mother has seen

it and and she is over the moon about it

872
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:23,060
so only for that it was it was

873
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,770
worthwhile the stripes or preparing this

874
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:28,150
presentation and to all of you for

875
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,150
coming to listen thank you very much

876
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:45,330
we have time for just one very brief

877
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:46,860
question in touch with me there's a very

878
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:52,920
quick question over there and that

879
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:57,860
microphone it's a difficult question

880
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,860
actually it was a great talk thank you

881
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:08,630
you've said that you have seriously

882
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:12,330
stressful situations but you are in in

883
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:17,160
company in an external company to the

884
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:20,970
one you're providing the service to how

885
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:22,740
do you do it to be so committed with

886
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:26,459
your customer since you actually work

887
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:33,089
for a company outside but I can assure

888
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:36,390
you it can be quite stressful but how

889
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:38,870
did you manage for your workers to feel

890
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:44,040
close to the customer they're working to

891
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:46,500
but it is our job we get paid to tune in

892
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,320
anyone get nervous because we learn we

893
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,960
are more aware than a customers of

894
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,970
what's going on so we are the ones will

895
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,520
proactively get nervous when we see

896
00:53:53,970 --> 00:54:00,990
what's going on but it is part of the

897
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:04,880
job there's nothing it's worse no

898
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:04,879
surgeons have a harder time I'm sure

899
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,940
[Applause]
