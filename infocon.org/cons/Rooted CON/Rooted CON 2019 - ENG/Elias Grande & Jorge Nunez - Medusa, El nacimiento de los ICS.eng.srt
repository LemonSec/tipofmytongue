1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:06,810
good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,960
thanks for coming and thanks for the

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:15,928
organizers inviting us to come and tell

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:19,970
you about this project the first comment

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,369
I like I said it's not control

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,810
industrial control systems like a SCADA

7
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:30,810
nothing of the sort because people offer

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:33,780
are very common question it is why were

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,170
titled Medusa and you see a serpent

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,570
where it's a question that few number

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:46,410
people have asked who is familiar with

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:52,530
Greek mythology Medusa I don't see that

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:56,629
people made in the hunt for those who

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,629
are not familiar with this figure is

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:11,790
it's a priestess temple very proud of

16
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,689
her beauty and they don't went into the

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:21,750
temple and raped her and prevent further

18
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:24,000
attacks eternal hair into this woman

19
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,590
with serpents in her head and if you

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,079
looked at her eyes you became a stone

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,320
who became vitrified and that's why I'm

22
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:38,880
it was her is the image of her guardian

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,610
or a protector understand what this

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:47,610
project is about both Jorge and myself

25
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:50,210
have devoted time with this type to

26
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,729
these type of projects when we live work

27
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:59,008
so what he has already introduced us I

28
00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:01,670
am the one on top of the slide and Jorge

29
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,670
is below

30
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:11,490
so this is in our presentation

31
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,209
interaction in state-of-the-art the

32
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:20,660
project Medusa and conclusions as of

33
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:28,100
today the state of the art is binary

34
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:31,380
like computing just very very lucky and

35
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,359
nothing happens the company and you

36
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,049
don't you know it but you actually

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,970
believe you have great security systems

38
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,100
are there is the other option which

39
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,620
they've gone all the way india company

40
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,620
you know there's something strange there

41
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,459
somebody is crawling your system and

42
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:58,250
your monitoring is actually detected

43
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:58,250
when you want to realized the TV's gone

44
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:15,079
just check it again see how this

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:19,220
happened at the farm so five levels of

46
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:25,670
security from a more active or manual

47
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:31,670
security where people participate more

48
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:36,029
in the parching and the passive defense

49
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:40,018
the IPS antivirus firewalls and then the

50
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,630
next level requires more intelligence on

51
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,840
data how you being attacked and so on

52
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:50,519
it's all you get to the offensive part

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,850
Israel we've gone into the legal

54
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,650
controversies or the concept of hoc back

55
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,858
how many people in the room are familiar

56
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,750
they come to hug back who hasn't heard

57
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,750
about it from me in these two days

58
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:10,950
how back are the actions and a victim

59
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:15,269
performs against an attacker to identify

60
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:19,978
him to stop his activity or can monitor

61
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:24,090
its behavior so if a company is being

62
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:27,270
victim of an attack and in order to stop

63
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:34,919
it and identify they actually face the

64
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:39,330
attacker there are quite a lot of legal

65
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:41,609
issues involved here and it's not a

66
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,330
situation it's not quite clear one of

67
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,560
the legal problems could be the

68
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:54,180
proportionate response collateral damage

69
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,729
is another topic for instance you cannot

70
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,620
attack just the person who's attacking

71
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,229
but you can have an impact on other

72
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,110
companies other customers that didn't

73
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:07,530
have any responsibility and then you

74
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:11,160
have the hack back back so you attack me

75
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:14,929
I attack you and then you roll up your

76
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,930
sleeves and say okay here I go

77
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:29,849
try these legal issues in 2017 member of

78
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:33,270
Congress Table eight from Georgia United

79
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:38,370
States make this legal proposal with

80
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:41,430
some three pages in which allows for the

81
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,020
development and deployment of tools that

82
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:53,930
will help that hurt him the hacking so

83
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:53,930
so to identified block it and monitor it

84
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:07,290
that are not so convincing by for Google

85
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:12,750
or Microsoft so they are trying to help

86
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:14,490
sort of cover close the gaps the

87
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,740
existing gaps in these situations

88
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,890
does somebody know why Microsoft could

89
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,890
have something against this legislation

90
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:29,750
or somebody remembers what and make

91
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,750
herself did in 2014 against Metalworks

92
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:42,240
do you know the company meet Al Gore's

93
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:45,150
parent companies I know you do well I

94
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,060
tell you what happened the graphic ways

95
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,669
to to be more specific in the meet

96
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,560
health company to vote that's worse that

97
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,770
happened they started affecting

98
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,170
Microsoft customers but those two

99
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:03,719
botnets were set up in such a way that

100
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:09,990
beat alibis that they were in their own

101
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:12,330
domain with always haven't realized that

102
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,940
that was being deployed inter-domain IAM

103
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,580
in that domain Microsoft and Microsoft

104
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,590
deploy in the way Microsoft and they

105
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:25,320
started a counter-attack against the 23

106
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:27,359
domains of middleware three in nine days

107
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,990
in which me that work without knowing

108
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:37,169
that Microsoft was going into attack

109
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:40,640
they they eventually could prove that

110
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,640
mr. white didn't know

111
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:47,390
Microsoft was attacking and after those

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,390
90 days maker saw had to made a public

113
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,740
declaration apologizing for having

114
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,270
attacked without permission and having

115
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,710
affected me tell where the customers

116
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,450
come to attack the first thing we should

117
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,270
take into account is that we need to

118
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,780
have the necessary tools to be able to

119
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:09,510
identify and one of the tools that we

120
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,460
could have for the identification would

121
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:16,710
be perceived offenses that have

122
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:21,810
identified as the second layer of the

123
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:31,200
attacks a proportion so the ideas or

124
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:33,990
IPSS or the revenue aft target is

125
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,700
searching or malicious signatures but

126
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:42,870
they don't care to that of of a car for

127
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,850
doesn't understand a cross side they are

128
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,380
only looking for signatures at the

129
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,220
packet level so the difference between

130
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:54,000
the IDS that monitors the network but

131
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,420
without going get in the middle of the

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,830
communication or the IP address that

133
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,829
gets in the middle of the communication

134
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:04,680
and and it detects those packages they

135
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:16,950
remove them from the network so these

136
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:19,890
are ideas and IPS so you can know where

137
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:24,420
we're heading and then the WAAF which

138
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:27,380
are already at the level 7 and they can

139
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:31,770
protect against threats such as SQL I

140
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:36,930
session hijacking etc so if I define at

141
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:39,960
the perimeter and I and these systems to

142
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,300
attack those attacks they are they end

143
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,760
up being in the middle so we have to

144
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,630
incise them so that my own architecture

145
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,920
is not diminished

146
00:09:46,630 --> 00:10:00,009
and therefore the very variably variable

147
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:02,079
for invoicing is a number of the number

148
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:05,259
that they received for instance in I'm I

149
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,638
thought between the number of rules and

150
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:09,880
then there is the request for police

151
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,949
process what they were going to the

152
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,180
central point were over question coming

153
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:18,370
so for a call a request that are

154
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,920
reviewed I will invoice the you for them

155
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:29,500
so if I go to Microsoft well it's the

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:32,110
same thing tribes avoid we attacks these

157
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,279
attacks to my structure but there are

158
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,930
two profile the good guy which is trying

159
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,110
which is our customer was trying to

160
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:45,959
access our business and the bad one that

161
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,959
really wants to attack there is the good

162
00:10:47,550 --> 00:11:02,680
installed Kali and senses any tool just

163
00:10:56,439 --> 00:11:06,599
to test attack your infrastructure so

164
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:10,569
I'm being influenced by the number of

165
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:14,410
requests that my IPS is cleaning up

166
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:18,519
obviously with somebody like this like

167
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,110
this one and with this type of twins you

168
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,709
want to feel like doing this to that

169
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,959
because they're actually inhaling a lot

170
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:30,209
of additional cost and additional noise

171
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:38,229
generated in all the layers of what

172
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:41,819
could be using this a cases for which is

173
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,819
what we have focused on for this project

174
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:51,610
how many of you have used at least one

175
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:56,500
of these tools I'm surprised that not

176
00:11:51,610 --> 00:12:01,390
everybody has done so but anyway hey we

177
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:05,500
have used all of these tools please

178
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:10,240
raise your hands raise your hands if you

179
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:14,050
if you have felt that you can't believe

180
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,660
this when this happened at the end of

181
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,240
the day we have a number of tools us

182
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,550
have a positive part and a negative part

183
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,290
the positive one is these are automated

184
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,319
tools that are going to give you

185
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,060
information very meaty information

186
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,850
without having that much security

187
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,089
knowledge the negative part is that

188
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,850
these are automatic automated tools that

189
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:40,390
are going to use attack patterns and are

190
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:43,000
easy to identify and that's what we have

191
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:46,089
used in this project we are going to do

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,460
an analysis of each and every one of

193
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:51,790
these tools that we're going to see how

194
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:54,810
they are regarding those attack patterns

195
00:12:51,790 --> 00:13:01,030
and we're going to try to be able to

196
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:04,599
identify them what we have done in this

197
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:08,490
PPT what we have done is to classify

198
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,490
according to Road time

199
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:18,149
Java Python Ruby will see them one by

200
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:24,230
one

201
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:26,670
in the case of Z AP whatever the

202
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,720
operating system and they start by a

203
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:34,860
version you are always going to get the

204
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,160
C user agent that's quite an important

205
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:42,390
hint but also in terms of signatures

206
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,209
when you're doing those attacks it's

207
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:48,540
going to you know get a pre-loaded list

208
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:51,599
that you can very clearly identify and

209
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,819
that's not all if you notice on the

210
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,120
fourth line at the end it says o

211
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:01,770
Watterson dot or so if you even doubt

212
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,860
there that you have it works with we

213
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,529
have focused on the problem why because

214
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,610
the proper has a number of very wide

215
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:16,939
dictionaries which is actually quite

216
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:20,190
good to the attacks through the intruder

217
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:23,160
the thousand possibilities so if we

218
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,140
focus a bit on the project part we in

219
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,709
terms of the user agent they have a

220
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:32,339
dictionary that are they make the

221
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:35,069
requests they modify this user agent and

222
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,810
and uses another dictionary for

223
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,240
signatures so if we take into account

224
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,819
those possible combinations that might

225
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:47,610
be generated we shall also be able to

226
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:49,589
identify it w3 af so we're lowering the

227
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,570
parameter here you can see that the user

228
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:56,279
agent it tells you who it is

229
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:57,839
so simple but imagine they don't tell us

230
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:00,689
because not everybody's going to use

231
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,180
just a big button if in a month's time

232
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,400
you're still learning and you say I'm

233
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,040
gonna remove this user agent also

234
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,699
detected from their signature we have

235
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,740
this pattern in both and all of these

236
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,630
requests that have been pre-loaded

237
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:21,410
so once more we are able to identify it

238
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:26,799
Wapiti it is true that Wapiti is one

239
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:29,689
most complex tools when it comes to

240
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,549
looking for the patent at the signature

241
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:33,889
level and we have to look at certain

242
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:34,848
terms using this requires to be able to

243
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:40,639
identify them

244
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:45,499
however as a here's the region it says

245
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,269
the time with which it's running which

246
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:49,909
is very important for our project and

247
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:53,899
the operating systems which is very

248
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:55,999
interesting information if we

249
00:15:53,899 --> 00:16:00,649
particularly if we are in a hack back

250
00:15:55,999 --> 00:16:04,039
mode in the case of Arachne more of the

251
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:06,319
same I likely not only tells you I am

252
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,809
Arachne but I also I also tell you who

253
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:13,519
it's version I'm using that's pretty

254
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:19,549
peculiar in terms of signature you can

255
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:22,999
see very clearly it users I'm in front

256
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:24,098
and the attack on front and and the

257
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:27,739
other one behind

258
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:31,479
NICTA for me is the jewel of the crown

259
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:34,699
because it reminds me nickytom back on

260
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:37,429
and it's a fabulous film is the

261
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:41,089
knowledge diary because it tells you I

262
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:45,079
am about sila but then it says no no I

263
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:48,019
mean it and then it's a summation but

264
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:51,228
then it tells you that he's done to do a

265
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:53,749
test and then it tells you exactly the

266
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:56,209
type of test that gonna make sure you

267
00:16:53,749 --> 00:17:02,059
get as much information as you need and

268
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:05,539
some more so a clear in terms of in

269
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:08,928
natures it is true that what it does is

270
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:13,009
- they contain the IP the host name in

271
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:16,939
the pattern itself and it has central

272
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:17,299
certain contracts to see if it can stop

273
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:19,580
it

274
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:21,879
so it really easy to the tempers

275
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:24,879
and that's how we get to one of the

276
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,880
sentences

277
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,200
that says our dear many committees

278
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,168
knowledge is power

279
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:39,150
so we have the knowledge because we know

280
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:44,559
the rule you've used to attack and now

281
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:47,410
it is a power and a power entails a

282
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,559
great responsibility so what do we want

283
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:54,130
to do with that power and here is where

284
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:58,149
my colleagues imagination played out and

285
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:02,470
he said let's destroy their machine we

286
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:06,070
send them reference exploit but we do

287
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,830
not want to be Microsoft we just want to

288
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:15,340
slap them at most we don't want to punch

289
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:19,980
them in the face so what do we do we

290
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:25,470
attack a vulnerabilities of the tool the

291
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,470
version 2.70

292
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,949
we are in architecture so I don't feel

293
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,540
like it

294
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:38,470
well what are we going to do I'll go

295
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:41,320
straight for the runtime I I know the

296
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,750
tomb I know they're wrong time so I can

297
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,040
attack at the runtime level and we're

298
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:51,010
going to attack the share knowledge base

299
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,309
and are already available so it is easy

300
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:58,570
very simple and with all of this it's

301
00:18:54,309 --> 00:19:03,070
with which Medusa was burned Medusa is

302
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:05,340
that ICS service that the VSS mentioned

303
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:08,370
which allows you to do a counter-attack

304
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,370
against the

305
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,750
wherever one wanted to send an automated

306
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:19,000
tool so what will matters I use well the

307
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,000
place of knowledge based on the existing

308
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,490
egg price of denial of service or them

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,059
from my favorite overflow works it's

310
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:31,029
wrong and that's not all I have a

311
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,830
calibration and here in automatic

312
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:36,039
learning based on experience and an

313
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,610
observation that means you are attacking

314
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,330
me

315
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:43,979
never mind I will on this one and I'm

316
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,750
going to take out my available exploit

317
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,470
at the time when I see that you no

318
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:53,289
longer answer then I stole that so I

319
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:57,509
give you that slap and just in case you

320
00:19:53,289 --> 00:20:02,009
decide to come back I remember this IP

321
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:05,440
this IP did this at high source and is

322
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:07,509
deeply in back and given another Slough

323
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,360
so one of the things we want you to be

324
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:12,970
able to be able to put in context is

325
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,500
where exactly these metals are going to

326
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:19,210
be and that's where we find the

327
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,700
activation part based on the circuit

328
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:28,350
breaker pattern how many of you have

329
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:28,350
that fix even for at the movies

330
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:40,100
how many of you having Netflix are

331
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:44,690
familiar with the district product which

332
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,870
is within infrastructure for those who

333
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:51,610
do not Louis know it history is a little

334
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:55,879
product within the Netflix technology

335
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:59,049
based on preparing the infrastructure of

336
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:03,890
the applications to make them a failure

337
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:08,418
tolerant own as it says in a very

338
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:10,490
graphic way if I do request initially

339
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:13,490
and it also depends on different

340
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:17,480
services it could be that one of those

341
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:20,720
services external services starts

342
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,929
degrading or a happening or latency and

343
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,530
what do we get with that well we will

344
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:30,640
end with all requests women be like you

345
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:35,809
until that dependence or external

346
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,880
service and by responding or otherwise

347
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:40,940
the whole infrastructure falls in a

348
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:44,240
cascade of fashion is all the Netflix

349
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,429
approach this second perfect breaker is

350
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,470
I'm not going to do we throw the

351
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:52,580
infrastructure on the Cascade mode but

352
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:55,640
I'm going to if I detect that there is a

353
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:59,750
dependency that's a FRA in my system and

354
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,780
will allow will drive this cascade fall

355
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,580
I'm going to do an answer by default and

356
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,220
I won't go to that dependency until it's

357
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:12,260
over and with the clothes in the circuit

358
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,730
I will give back respond by effect so

359
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:17,390
the customer has the necessary

360
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:20,210
complement as and as a response and the

361
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:22,429
infrastructure doesn't fall that's which

362
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,549
if we focus on the detection tools that

363
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:29,720
we've mentioned in the Y the Netflix

364
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:31,970
approaches to protect the services that

365
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,809
are receiving the requests from the

366
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:38,030
external dependencies but in our case

367
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:39,899
what we want is to do the opposite what

368
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,559
I want us to protect

369
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:46,010
business service from external threats

370
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:52,918
so if right now I have within my

371
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:55,620
infrastructure if the customer all of

372
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,730
the requests that are not detected will

373
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,918
go straight to the business service so

374
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:05,070
should I have one malicious customer who

375
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,460
is launching some pattern with this type

376
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,379
of automated tool rather than seeing it

377
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,140
as an isolated thinking that this

378
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,350
request is a cart and redirected to

379
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:19,620
another place what this would be

380
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:23,039
forwarding it to this project that is

381
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:27,209
waiting with open arms as hahaaa were

382
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,220
saying to to give him to give a slap so

383
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:32,370
we're trying to develop start with the

384
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,090
attacker and so they stop generating

385
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:38,340
noise in the parameter layers the

386
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:41,070
automated tool is removed and and it

387
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,779
serves an infrastructure attacking but

388
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,850
then you have the manual guide with the

389
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,880
manual guy defending the infrastructure

390
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:52,350
but you do not have that noise and that

391
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:55,710
additional cost so who is so welcome in

392
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:58,678
our methods well once they've forward

393
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:01,320
this requires this is what we will find

394
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,870
within malucia on the one hand we have

395
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,510
the Medusa engine and in the other one

396
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,219
today they exploit as a service in

397
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,809
different containers and with completely

398
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:14,760
different functionalities that we will

399
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:19,500
explain next first of all the engine has

400
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:23,809
this layer of responsibility to do the

401
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:28,410
analysis of the query itself to maintain

402
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:32,430
that shared knowledge always updated

403
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:38,850
and to do the calibration and from then

404
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:42,900
on return through that communication

405
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:45,949
channel the turn back the exploit so it

406
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,770
is differentiated as you can see in four

407
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:53,640
four grown faces and we will explain

408
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:56,940
each one in detail phase one hypothesis

409
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:00,440
generation here we analyze the request

410
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:03,990
that we've received looking at the you

411
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:07,890
URL the payload the user agent etc to

412
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:10,200
generate a hypothesis and I'm not going

413
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,270
to say it I'm going to show it at the

414
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,210
end you get the request to this module

415
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:18,840
and it's going to tell me the truth is a

416
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:22,230
burn and the runtime on which it is is

417
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,209
Hama yeah this is a hypothesis it's not

418
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,760
necessarily the final one for that we

419
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,160
need a face or Phase two we did the

420
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:35,360
review that hypothesis based on of the

421
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:38,370
IP track record sorry if they were here

422
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,219
and goddess lab we repeat that swab and

423
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:44,969
we adjust the hypothesis so we will have

424
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:51,000
the tool with this I paid tells me that

425
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:54,900
it's a verb and a Java so these review

426
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,680
phase I just fine Tunes a bit more

427
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:01,080
interests based on the track record this

428
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,630
is what I have so now we know that it's

429
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:07,610
examined the run time right around time

430
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:13,990
is child what do we do now we know the

431
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:20,168
PvE a list of CV years that allow us

432
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:24,220
do that attack to the malicious agent

433
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:26,169
our attacker so what we are going to say

434
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,490
at the end for that truth

435
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:35,580
and for that runtime I'm going to do a

436
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:41,049
cv cv and what's next

437
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:44,470
what - to get the exploit and for that

438
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:47,139
we use that part which is the exploit as

439
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,960
a service and because everything has to

440
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:54,370
be as a service now the wage is no fun

441
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:57,549
and this is what we would have you see

442
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:00,178
we have that owner who's been 64 paces

443
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:03,899
and that's for a reason

444
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:11,049
they succeeded because when we try to

445
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:16,090
destroy initially when we returned the

446
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:19,270
exploit we heard myself so we were

447
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:22,590
wondering what's happening this is what

448
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:26,260
happened it's on page 64 and that's it

449
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:30,149
and now we can tell you a bit about how

450
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:32,919
he exploited as a service works

451
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:38,439
it's called basics before but it's not

452
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:41,919
an exploit guys I can leave this to you

453
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,270
as a challenge if you want so we were

454
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,919
just looking for that control ha

455
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:49,350
hardware with a minimal collateral

456
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,480
damage

457
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:54,719
so therefore have those processes

458
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,760
service

459
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:02,890
so mainly he tries to repress that

460
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:07,570
explore it has a service and leave it as

461
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:08,950
we can see here have cached so that they

462
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,139
don't have to be blind it's blocked

463
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,730
every time they request it so since

464
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:16,500
there are some exposed for the none of

465
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,250
services are by big that's why they meet

466
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:24,190
reader fast

467
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:29,170
MongoDB exploit comes in so what does it

468
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:31,300
occur fine next how many of you are our

469
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,790
nerds in the room please raise your hand

470
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:37,690
well get ready for this what do we need

471
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:45,190
to do a EAS first of all something that

472
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:49,650
via API exposes us and to return the

473
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:52,770
exploit are 64 bits because playing with

474
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,760
raw exploit give spout response we've

475
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,280
already tested it

476
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,500
no need something to keep an exploit why

477
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,790
should we reinvent the wheel if the

478
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,010
attacker maybe attacker with a

479
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:07,200
pre-loaded knowledge base let's use it

480
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,700
so eventually kataka will find the

481
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,610
semblance claws that they could launch

482
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:16,950
to me we feel me or against me on paper

483
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:22,550
structure between when I get by the API

484
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:25,890
- on that exploit that will compile the

485
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:29,190
base relationship so much explosion like

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:31,350
the usual more effective friend oh so

487
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,960
long he's bugging me tell me where I'm

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,250
coming that so I need an IP report but

489
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,800
no don't go there

490
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:40,530
I've got it here in the FG I'm just

491
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,919
asking for the bar 64 in the exploit to

492
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:53,639
get it back in the channel they have

493
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:57,740
opened so to try to half a person would

494
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:01,160
have a serious about the services melody

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:08,480
and now I'm gonna explain functionally

497
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:11,870
requires a CV is CV Travis with

498
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:19,370
application to the met exploit this

499
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:23,000
application basically racing TCP dump as

500
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:25,669
much as punch the song exploit to the

501
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:30,980
CFC so I'm kind of using myself seen

502
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:32,780
myself in the food you don't need to hit

503
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,920
him and since I don't have the option

504
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,379
come they don't explain

505
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,370
that's not compiled I am basically just

506
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:45,950
getting it as I can

507
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:48,879
thanks with TCP dumb so get it exploit a

508
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:54,620
long basis and that is one that travels

509
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:57,110
backwards automated my availing of a

510
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:02,060
knowledge base in net exploit and by

511
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:07,250
making believe that it's winning so he's

512
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:09,409
subtracted I can shoot myself but if I

513
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,270
shoot against local us there's not

514
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,940
visibility beyond wonderful container

515
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:17,139
Sousa control shooting as if it was him

516
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,140
in the vessel

517
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:27,450
and I was very funny comparison and no

518
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:30,350
you were you got a maverick so let's see

519
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,350
yeah real hard-luck

520
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:49,850
what

521
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:57,649
well the aim here is to have four

522
00:31:49,850 --> 00:32:02,480
scenarios on legitimate requests let's

523
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:06,529
just show it first of all we raise

524
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:10,519
deucey which is listening on port to the

525
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:16,850
5b and we're gonna make a request we're

526
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:19,879
gonna proxy fight through VoIP and the

527
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:24,289
good thing here is that needs to stop

528
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:28,928
functioning easy only demo where you're

529
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:31,158
not nervous because it might not work so

530
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:34,340
we're gonna do the request directly to

531
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:37,730
Medusa we're gonna forward it if you

532
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:41,899
notice some not adding any real query

533
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:44,720
power in the archer URL and you should

534
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:48,350
understand that it's fully normal

535
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,279
service without any sort of problem as

536
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:56,870
you see here we've got this because we

537
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:59,559
get an HTML I get a request and there's

538
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,559
no problem that

539
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:07,419
it goes directly without checking around

540
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:11,260
now we say okay so I'm gonna use a query

541
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:12,549
param usually use buys armed we're gonna

542
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,870
see when I get back

543
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:15,870
I've been with my Medusa

544
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:25,889
okay this will be a quirk we're

545
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:30,029
apparently nothing virtually Harvick on

546
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:32,449
the slide look he's gonna make the

547
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:32,450
request

548
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:41,930
and here it says well it has interpreted

549
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:45,740
Ori has interpreted it eases up by the

550
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:48,800
actual query that is his long chin as we

551
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,540
have said on the presentation it has a

552
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,480
split the user agent from the

553
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,610
irreparable if anyone had n t5 equal

554
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,630
partners possible we say they might say

555
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:03,290
these are fraud they were launched out

556
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:06,200
they seize the actual job exploit it

557
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:11,899
tries to deposit but it keeps working

558
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:16,040
there's no problem whatsoever okay so we

559
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:20,080
say ok so what can we do here we can

560
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:24,449
tackle directly from the board

561
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:27,449
so we're gonna you can use for example

562
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:27,449
this

563
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:39,779
we're gonna use this same request ask

564
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,780
for it to be filtered and here

565
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:48,270
we're gonna do this so here now let's

566
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:54,649
get to go to 1 to 7 level Oh 1 port 5 to

567
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:54,649
blow not gonna trick this

568
00:34:54,790 --> 00:35:01,840
we got this work directly and we know

569
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,000
exactly that these requests you saw the

570
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,880
ball is pretty one but these just

571
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,090
basically do a test and as you may see

572
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,060
here well you see three different

573
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:17,200
payloads but we the user the password

574
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:20,880
and the world so that seemed goes with

575
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,359
the first one and here we can set the

576
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,359
amount main

577
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:34,220
in the second one it would be the

578
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:34,220
password itself

579
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,870
here we are the passport

580
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,430
they're all very safe

581
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:55,310
but don't face every night so eventually

582
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:55,310
whenever we launch the attack

583
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:06,930
I know if you actually go and do it here

584
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:09,680
but I'm missing the last off and here

585
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,680
will be the user-agent

586
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,580
so we're gonna use

587
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,509
the user ID addiction release that is

588
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:28,379
preloaded in suite pro which is quite

589
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:31,880
and sounded quite extensive rather and

590
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:34,200
we launched it and they begin catenate

591
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,190
and if you notice this keeps working

592
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:41,149
there's no problem whatsoever however

593
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:46,710
what happens whenever I see the answer

594
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:50,280
well this is separate and here I'm

595
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:54,960
trying to do this civilization here we

596
00:36:50,280 --> 00:37:00,540
are attacked and usually it works even

597
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,730
when you get in the B and then when you

598
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:06,360
get it it kind of goes bounced this is

599
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:10,710
that and now when I look at the actual

600
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:14,150
code it's like okay I'm not able to

601
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,150
serialize the whole answer

602
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,009
so eventually these are tests well you

603
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,920
kind of stop it

604
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,350
and he's going to process the answer

605
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:30,600
over other partners we've done another

606
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:30,600
other tents with w3f

607
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,160
okay

608
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:55,900
in the case of w aw3 AF will have a same

609
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:59,740
situation we raise a machine and this

610
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:05,610
has a different behavior we launched

611
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:11,080
exploit they get requests and you found

612
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:14,710
you he says as is a w3 AF things is

613
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:20,350
appeared not w3 AF was it the only kind

614
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:21,910
of clear said we have got him couple of

615
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:23,980
splines for the test one of them didn't

616
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,140
work but he's one in particular looks

617
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,120
like it kiss it

618
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,400
here's the tool and it goes bounced so

619
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:33,850
these are just a couple of examples

620
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,620
touch forward which is a couple of

621
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:40,990
samples that show the quality of these

622
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:44,759
tool that may be improved where we have

623
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,759
for the times of answers

624
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,680
one more image and how you wanted so as

625
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:10,049
a conclusion to end regarding what we've

626
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:12,960
seen here the hard part is quite fun to

627
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:16,620
be honest and we always need to try to

628
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,670
give slaps and not punches so when I

629
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:25,049
tried to avoid doing collateral damage

630
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:29,520
or excessive damage corporate wise is

631
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:31,260
the person who is startling are their

632
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,870
position and will need to do whatever

633
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:39,090
they have to do but whoever is next door

634
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:42,930
shouldn't get a silly attack another

635
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:47,310
conclusion is a very far button tools

636
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:50,970
are not necessarily bad or useless and

637
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:53,400
finally quite useful but there he is the

638
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:57,359
identifiable and based on this project

639
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:00,920
we can see it based on the behavior

640
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,920
which is what we have shown

641
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:07,530
that many areas for improvement

642
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,779
aggravation

643
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:13,390
in fact anyone who on sue Johnson

644
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,849
counter she'll contact any of us and

645
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,950
we'll keep working of it because project

646
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:21,340
is quite cool and we do have a laugh

647
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:24,669
with it and I think that it can be

648
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:27,150
grateful at least noting these

649
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:30,190
essentially yes we like to add anything

650
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:34,510
well just to say that the main objective

651
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:35,680
here was the demo I thought that we can

652
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,680
minimize collateral damage

653
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,410
I'm trying to think of those who love

654
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,990
speaking of one of these going to be

655
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:46,799
legitimate to implemented in countries

656
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:50,799
such as ours one of our corporations

657
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,920
will have an online user so by not

658
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:57,849
Cavalia hands the blockage of the

659
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:01,480
automated - I kind of petrifies it it

660
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:03,910
has an inducer basically we're just

661
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,030
thinking of that out of whether it would

662
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,029
be possible

663
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,520
and the other item will be that we

664
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,980
haven't looked feel the denial of

665
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,240
service but Paul here was saying none of

666
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:21,800
his lamp another punch there could I

667
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:25,529
know his exploits for coding win

668
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:32,670
whenever we were it was such a rarity of

669
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:34,140
the actual working with the CPU so their

670
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:38,450
threat management of the automotive

671
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,450
tunable done too long to take the code

672
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:44,910
execution so that whoever is attacking

673
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:47,910
is left without after doing that so

674
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,830
we're open for Q&A and we have actually

675
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:54,660
software timing so hope you enjoyed it

676
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:58,049
if you have any comments or anything to

677
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:05,790
share we're willing to to listen thank

678
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:08,810
you very much never wonder other any

679
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,810
questions hi

680
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:20,310
well this is legal because law and

681
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:24,170
common sense or do not always match so

682
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:27,299
if I do this with my best intention our

683
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:28,830
official entity he might think that it's

684
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,869
fair but someone might come with a

685
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:33,480
lawyer and I might say that I'm reaching

686
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:34,710
the rights then I got me into a big a

687
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,650
problem that was the first thing that we

688
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:40,440
wonder about so his approach is

689
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:43,619
basically the legislation according to

690
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,780
the country the u.s. I said is a bit

691
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:49,080
more legitimate depending on the sector

692
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,660
even in our country unfortunately fans

693
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:56,609
such as a defense actor could be

694
00:42:51,660 --> 00:43:01,170
implemented but in a private company in

695
00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:03,660
Spain they assemble this kind of

696
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:07,760
solution often we go Madusa Guardian

697
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,759
survey this is the approach

698
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:18,270
and here Google launched its so so yeah

699
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:23,160
whoever these within sees whether it's

700
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:27,540
feasible well I also have a developing

701
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:32,600
past and I'm kind of afraid of showing

702
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:32,600
this code Yoast whenever it's clean

703
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,650
cleaner our intention is to freedom but

704
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:45,810
the main idea was to share all those

705
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:50,910
flows and how that is transferred so you

706
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:54,540
know quickly we do it in exploited

707
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:58,109
service we have an exploit in soccer

708
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:03,120
deck we have other projects in Google

709
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:06,390
and github so that you can gain more

710
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,319
quickly than we do don't call clean the

711
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,950
call it

712
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:15,800
we found refactoring it's actually

713
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:15,799
cleaning to be honest I don't believe it

714
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:23,420
we are from the Wonka rayhan Coliseum

715
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,680
University we haven't studied Telecom

716
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:30,510
aren't you worried that's all Mike

717
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:33,930
Hughes is reflected on well the approach

718
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:35,200
of reflect in attacks were do me yes we

719
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:38,850
talk

720
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,850
a third party platform

721
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:48,040
well if you have Luke times Alphonsus

722
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,560
presentation I don't know what the Sun

723
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:58,330
project really has meant exploded there

724
00:44:50,560 --> 00:45:00,009
were a saloon face which exploit to send

725
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:03,250
a rattlin attack version and these are

726
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:08,770
same approach from the other side if in

727
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:11,830
your company you implemented one against

728
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:14,530
the other is not possible whoever and

729
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:17,650
Thomas is opening our nature HTTP

730
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:22,420
channel and export is just that use of

731
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:25,810
the client may be in fact the different

732
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:30,250
systems might not get into the reply

733
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:33,610
traffic so if you are here non channel

734
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:36,910
town whoever guesses lab is is wrong

735
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:40,120
here you're not getting the first Rancho

736
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:41,529
Oh whoever he is look at the newspaper

737
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,990
this is idea that we have a beginning

738
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:46,000
which is which would I mentioned earlier

739
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:51,939
what do we do do we go the rock against

740
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,730
machine well we went with a me details

741
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:57,220
and not to kill everything but rather to

742
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:59,350
go to a specific objective for some

743
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:04,259
point that wrong time may have online

744
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:06,089
services well if I do who Java - heart

745
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:11,329
the exploit travels through that

746
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:11,328
instance of wrong time ever have a James

747
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,749
that Rhonda mahasin opened the requests

748
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:21,479
so therefore they return exploiting they

749
00:46:18,749 --> 00:46:23,999
only goes to that wrong time that's how

750
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:26,129
we minimize that's what we need to

751
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:33,868
minimize collateral damage okay thank

752
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:35,549
you first of all congratulations full

753
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:39,089
presentation is a very interesting idea

754
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:42,359
super cool but I do wonder whether you

755
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:47,239
wouldn't run the risk of qualifying that

756
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:51,499
website as malicious I mean eventually

757
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:55,499
our browser extensions might say careful

758
00:46:51,499 --> 00:47:01,738
the website of this company my twitter

759
00:46:55,499 --> 00:47:06,769
malicious code which browser nowadays is

760
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:06,769
on in Python Java rules

761
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:16,300
- is Donnie Brasco you know how to call

762
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:18,490
rasp you found expose the right age to

763
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,530
those tools that you put in the middle

764
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:22,959
as you may have seen eventually if I'm

765
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:25,810
attacking now how the actual Firefox and

766
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,850
I put a book before my launched a query

767
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:30,610
in it because in a way they're returning

768
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,670
trying to travel to a second channel and

769
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,590
the browser will see a real sausage

770
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:39,250
about time so you might go there ready

771
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:43,390
to open it and I say ok gonna do a

772
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:46,600
repeater when you that repeater that is

773
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:48,670
say Kingdom that will get roasted the

774
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,339
browser will keep working so the main

775
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:54,840
idea is not really to bust their browser

776
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:57,970
or rather all those swords with runtime

777
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:01,059
unfortunately the actual browsers are

778
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:04,598
not built on it

779
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:07,089
it's actually a good approach I do

780
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:11,140
understand the question if you're

781
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:14,558
sending explosions some I said well be

782
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:18,549
careful because these pages sending you

783
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:20,380
grant them I think will be the test we

784
00:48:18,549 --> 00:48:25,679
have come here to play and we're

785
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:27,369
architecture in fact I'm from Telecom so

786
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:31,089
that's the idea

787
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:33,819
Jos imagine this if we set it up for

788
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:37,209
abandoned the process gonna generate

789
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:39,249
will be like well this bunk is the

790
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:42,908
launching of spoilers against the

791
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:45,098
climate and here you have a second break

792
00:48:42,909 --> 00:48:48,669
up the ultimate user would be in the

793
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:52,479
browser browsing on the actual different

794
00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:55,359
URLs whenever the client whatever will

795
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:59,468
put will euros or guess I gotta make it

796
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:03,038
to the illegitimate user will go to the

797
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:06,880
business service and the other one will

798
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:09,909
go with Medusa that's ok but since

799
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,799
eventually the plug rounds of these kind

800
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:13,799
of sanctions go over to domain level

801
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,640
the browser will never know whether

802
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:24,749
you're going to one or bad one but it is

803
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:27,509
right what does a good focus to review

804
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:33,448
actually well thank you very much thank

805
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:41,640
you some of these nice person running an

806
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:44,459
agreed upon by a wife and the idea and

807
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,969
just to come and Ernie technically I do

808
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:50,969
have a question a comment would this be

809
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:54,959
something like in a denial-of-service

810
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:58,339
attack a firewall would launch a sim

811
00:49:54,959 --> 00:50:01,319
cookie and block the socket directly and

812
00:49:58,339 --> 00:50:04,140
then the denial of service but that

813
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:08,279
explodes level well the approach is

814
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:11,249
rather devised let's say if I'll get a

815
00:50:08,279 --> 00:50:14,369
request and I'm gonna launch with an

816
00:50:11,249 --> 00:50:16,979
automated tool set of threats is opened

817
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:21,569
up and that renders were the wrong time

818
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:26,189
or the network card open so we should

819
00:50:21,569 --> 00:50:28,680
notify a universal request rather we're

820
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,299
gonna veil of all of them I don't go

821
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,259
directly to the wrong time to see

822
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:33,259
detector learn

823
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:37,860
destroying the wrong time that request

824
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:42,359
ratio depending on the automation of

825
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:46,530
Eurasian has a song so it's about not

826
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:51,240
launching one individually calibrate the

827
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:53,940
request and now the more requests we

828
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:56,250
have the more patterns we have and yet

829
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:59,820
the more we can focus it and get an

830
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:01,800
exploit towards a specific long time to

831
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:05,610
check whether any of those patterns he

832
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:09,630
shared amongst different tools okay in a

833
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:13,160
question thinking of the future whenever

834
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:17,670
is clean will be easily identifiable

835
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:21,390
because if it's identified the bad guys

836
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:27,120
when they see the morose exists that

837
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:30,180
might do I think well per sales cut off

838
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:33,540
Medusa's head and no should Adam and the

839
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:39,140
rotor will accept the paper well thank

841
