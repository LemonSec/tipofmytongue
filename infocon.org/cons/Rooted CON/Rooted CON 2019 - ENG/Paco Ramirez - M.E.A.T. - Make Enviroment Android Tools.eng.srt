1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,660
here we go thank you all for being here

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:12,870
I know it's complicated to be here after

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:15,929
lunch however I see thing I see people

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:23,600
still coming in first of all the name of

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:26,130
my presentation is meat non-words make

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,760
environment and virtools this is what

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:33,510
meat stand for me-80 so the idea is to

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,260
create tools in order to make auditing

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,269
process more agile and approved this is

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,710
what I'm what about discussing with you

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,670
here today so the topics for

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,969
representation is first of all an

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,190
introduction then auditing for mobile

14
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:53,160
devices I'm sure that a lot of people

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,599
here have any the mobile auditors I'll

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,679
talk about how auditing are conducted

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,480
and then I'll explain testing

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,869
environment which is most specifically

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,240
for the tool were created and some

20
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,310
conclusions let me introduce myself for

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,929
those of you who don't know me my name

22
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,030
is Paco Ramirez an IT engineering I have

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,259
a master's degree in cyber security I'm

24
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,869
a PhD candidate for mobile application

25
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:30,150
security security at university of

26
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:31,740
seville I work for in Noatak they gave

27
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,220
me the opportunity to be here with you

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,908
today actually so thank them and I've

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,960
been working in pen testing for four

30
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:49,020
years and I might cut it for mobile

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:54,270
devices but also for website hardware

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:57,270
hacking red team and also analysis of

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,420
devices Internet of Things Bluetooth

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,640
with Wi-Fi etc my researcher and

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,320
professor at the university of seville

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,070
so i'm working with students

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,590
[Music]

38
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,590
have several certifications that were

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:15,070
awarded to me and also responsible for

40
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,890
Oba Seville which is an association at

41
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:21,549
the world Association and we are we have

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:26,799
the chapter in Seville is led by me and

43
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:30,670
we teach what we do to different people

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,680
for this presentation we're not going to

45
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,920
talk about vulnerability or exploiting

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,310
or anything anything sensitive but I'm

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,390
going to talk about tests and things

48
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:46,180
from an academic point of view so no

49
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,920
failure analysis has been conducted for

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,630
that so that's the disclaimer

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,519
so auditing for mobile devices I like to

52
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,780
do this because probably some of you

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:02,380
have conducted mobile devices auditing

54
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,770
some people may may have not so let me

55
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:09,910
talk about a wasp you a wasp is a world

56
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:12,190
organization devoted to security they

57
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,340
started with a web application and now

58
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:18,359
we're working on mobile application so I

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,530
was like I said before is a world

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,550
organization that provides us with the

61
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,550
tools for auditing processes and to

62
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,430
implement security controls for our

63
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:36,630
applications so as you can see here is

64
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:41,500
the top ten of the tools so the ten most

65
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:44,560
regular applications and they are

66
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,440
updated by hours these are the most

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,600
frequent devices or tools for this kind

68
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,020
of applications so for those of us

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:04:01,600
working in hacking and pen testing etc

70
00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:05,560
one of them guides to follow was testing

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:08,230
guide that is published its fourth

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,110
edition as you can see they talked about

73
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:15,730
control and the control categorized

74
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:18,430
cookie sessions etc and each section

75
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:23,020
allow us to see how control

76
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:27,090
for example if we have kind of control

77
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:29,889
for cookies for example or the kind of

78
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,690
sensitivity of the cookie I can get

79
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,389
information from cookies this is

80
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,210
presented by our wasp in this kind and

81
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,669
this allows us to see how this control

82
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,669
can be organized also as you can see in

83
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:47,080
the screen on the left I'm sorry on your

84
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:51,639
right says the speaker we call black box

85
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:54,130
testing so a wasp specifies the kind of

86
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,650
auditing you're conducting and according

87
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,840
to the type of auditing how you will

88
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,940
complement the control what is

89
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,820
interesting for us and we which is more

90
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:12,870
updated is the mobile security devices

91
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,870
Hamas started studying websites

92
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:21,310
everything today is moving to the mobile

93
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:26,169
world and for that we also have the top

94
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:34,560
10 so 10 most unknown units for mobile

95
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:34,560
applications the same guide for website

96
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,539
this guy is a little bit different

97
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:46,448
because in most mobile this section we

98
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:48,909
have different categories of control we

99
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:52,510
have the first year the basic level

100
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:54,250
which allows us to conduct certain

101
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,900
controls of the application the second

102
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,740
tier is more demanding in terms of

103
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:03,219
security and then we also have a level 4

104
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,949
reverse energy engineering things I'm

105
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,150
sorry so depending on the kind of device

106
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:15,250
we are auditing we should be applying

107
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:18,310
one set of controls or or or another for

108
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,520
example applications to know where ATMs

109
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:25,590
are or the institutions that are closer

110
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,479
to me or so that demands in terms of

111
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,630
audit audit in control and

112
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:36,280
and control and etc will be not as

113
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:38,650
strict as applications for the banking

114
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,479
system so depending on the kind of

115
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,039
application we are using we will be

116
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,220
applying some kind of controls or

117
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,650
another one so the guide you will find

118
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,900
two columns and the columns show you the

119
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:53,169
kind of controls to be conducted so you

120
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,929
can have a tick on the right column and

121
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,070
depending on the level of application or

122
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,660
the kind of application you will be

123
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,730
applying one kind of control or the

124
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,740
other

125
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,840
these are the main controls but I would

126
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,420
like to focus on five kinds of control

127
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,479
why is that if one application has these

128
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:15,150
five controls it will be difficult for

129
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,310
us to continue auditing because the

130
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:23,140
auditor will have a lot of obstacles so

131
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:27,910
first control is SSL pinning route

132
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:33,430
detection anti tampering debug mode the

133
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:35,980
detection and obfuscated code and also

134
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:41,020
anti tampering anti tampering is a

135
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:46,480
verification you need to verify that a

136
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:50,020
unit will not be modified obfuscated

137
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,600
codes means something simple it is to

138
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:59,760
say I have an application I have it

139
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:04,180
closed feature and instead of naming it

140
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:09,490
in an obvious way for example see the

141
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:13,120
key with the password this will be

142
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:16,210
replaced by letters ABCD to prevent

143
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,850
hackers to attack me so if someone wants

144
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:23,200
to attack this application and this

145
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:26,110
feature numbers and letters the code

146
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,300
will be more difficult to decipher then

147
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,500
we have route detection for this section

148
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:38,460
why this kind of controls are applied

149
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:40,159
when we have a rooted device the ammos

150
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,860
meaning

151
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,629
is the set of files where the

152
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:49,250
application is being activated is like a

153
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:51,440
box and we are not we don't have this we

154
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,990
don't have a root in the mobile device

155
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,500
we will not be able to analyze these

156
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,779
files so if we if I only have a root

157
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,430
detection control if I don't have this

158
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:05,149
root detection control I will not be

159
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:09,920
able to access these files also debug if

160
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:13,699
I cannot have access to this but if I

161
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,969
can debug the application to see how the

162
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:20,209
application evolves and its registry I

163
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,569
will be able to see how it works so if I

164
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:27,439
don't have the debug taxes tax are

165
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:30,800
easier and lastly SSL pinning which is

166
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:34,219
actually the most difficult for us our

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,189
attacks because at the end of the day we

168
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,550
need to apply them the Divine's the

169
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:43,459
static code but we need to see what the

170
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:51,529
communications are and we have to make

171
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:54,380
it go through a specific point so we

172
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:58,519
need even if we have a certificate in

173
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:02,050
the application meaning according to the

174
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,880
scheme if the attacker I'm in the middle

175
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,189
Chilly's be application and say I can

176
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,980
break your communication if this

177
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:12,199
certificate that arrives in the

178
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,360
application which is a malware that I

179
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:17,000
put in the middle if the application was

180
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,730
able to really underlies the certificate

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,860
and if it were possible for you if it

182
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,089
was possible for the device to see this

183
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,329
is not a good certificate so

184
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:30,199
communication will be stopped this is

185
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:33,888
the scheme multiplied so I establish

186
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:37,670
communication and once I verified the

187
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:39,620
first communication if I verify the

188
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:44,949
certificate and the certificate is not

189
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:48,430
one I haven't stored communication ends

190
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:53,819
and lastly in terms of anti tampering

191
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:57,180
which is also related to integrity

192
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:01,560
checking or something like that this is

193
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:04,380
used by CBS or ATMs actually if you open

194
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,709
it everything will be erased so anti

195
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:10,530
tampering uses a similar concept if you

196
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:16,530
run an application under Android you

197
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:20,160
should have a signed certificate verify

198
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:22,829
this developer certificate and this

199
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,550
certificate is not exactly the same as

200
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:30,300
the one that was the original I cannot

201
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:33,089
continue using the application this is

202
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,209
very difficult because either I modified

203
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,890
the function or I still the certificate

204
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:44,190
from the developer which is extremely

205
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:46,170
difficult and this is how we are going

206
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,450
to conduct auditing kind of controls to

207
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,510
be applied and we were talking about the

208
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,870
five most important ones

209
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:57,319
the idea is to optimize things why is

210
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:02,220
that let me give you an example of a

211
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:06,240
chart of an oddity I have five tests for

212
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:10,550
auditing a mobile application estimates

213
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,990
are half day to prepare the environment

214
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,599
two and a half days or three days for

215
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,150
testing and then I will have one more

216
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,580
why don't have more days or two days to

217
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:24,300
come up with a report that's the ideal

218
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:27,000
case for a five-day audit what happens

219
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,370
in reality so you have an auditor and

220
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,080
you he or she will be preparing the

221
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,060
environment for one or one and a half

222
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,940
days so one and a half days two days

223
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:40,020
four controls and then the report cannot

224
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:45,510
be touched upon because and the report

225
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:50,400
will be the same as before but what is

226
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:53,160
the problem quality and time you devote

227
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:58,650
time to prepare the entire the

228
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:02,400
environment for audit but control I mean

229
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:05,430
you will have less time for tests you

230
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,340
will only have one a half days so one

231
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,170
happy

232
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:12,940
place to prepare the environment and

233
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:15,610
then 1/2 days tests so the quality of

234
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,320
the item will be reduced because I will

235
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,010
not have time to verify the other

236
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,290
control in my experience in my

237
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,800
professional experience why does this

238
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,290
happen

239
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,250
this happens because each application is

240
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:36,880
a world in and of itself so we have an

241
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:41,380
application using the CRM system some of

242
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:44,200
the libraries are used only for REM or I

243
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:48,480
can say or I can see that certain

244
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:51,460
version the application doesn't run for

245
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:57,040
6.0 and this application will only be

246
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:59,860
used for 7.0 version on each application

247
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,779
is a world in and of itself I need to

248
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:06,480
prepare the environment for that audit

249
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:08,710
specifically so this was the

250
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,990
introduction of my presentation because

251
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,910
I wanted to focused on how we prepare

252
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,920
the environment I've been working with

253
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,069
customer for seven years for several

254
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:24,060
months so we have other things one of

255
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,060
them a week and we need to optimize time

256
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,550
but sometimes the problem is that you

257
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,220
need to use time not to optimize

258
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,130
controls and everything but to prepare

259
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:41,620
the environment this is when my

260
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:45,670
application comes in place make

261
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:49,000
environment Android tools meet m18 so we

262
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,740
are able to create an environment that

263
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,860
will be adapted to the application we

264
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:57,820
want to audit so this is the test when

265
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:01,089
we run the tool this is the home page of

266
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:06,040
the two we have two options when we

267
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:08,080
start start the audit or do something

268
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,390
else so we want to start the audit so

269
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,220
the first thing we are asked is the kind

270
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,319
of environment we want to work with if

271
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,690
we want to continue an emulated

272
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,260
environment

273
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,210
environment or a real environment and

274
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:24,900
depending on the kind of application we

275
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:31,020
can raise Android say six seven or eight

276
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:33,140
we can use this and so we are allowed to

277
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,640
decide what kind of environment we want

278
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:39,150
so what is the environment we will be

279
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,740
opting well it depends depends on what

280
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,350
it depends on the kind of applications I

281
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,890
have like I said before our application

282
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:50,400
have libraries that are run in RM so we

283
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:53,910
need to use a physical device but we

284
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,939
might have depending on the version of

285
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:59,819
our physical device is six point seven

286
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,040
zero so the application is for the

287
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,740
following version so we need to use an

288
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,770
emulated environment so you have

289
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,090
emulated devices or physical devices so

290
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,930
everything is possible with our

291
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,880
application

292
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:17,430
what is the following question we are

293
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:21,780
asked if you want your application to be

294
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:24,540
parched with freedom so let me give you

295
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:29,449
an introduction of freedom freedom is a

296
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,449
hooking tool what is cooking cooking

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,970
cling to a process to process with this

298
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,700
hooking tool I can modify or cling to

299
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,640
the process and modify the function I'm

300
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:52,080
interested in and change its results to

301
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,449
do that we have a tool widely spread

302
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:58,080
widely spread the tool called freedom

303
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,910
which allows us to enter a process

304
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:05,459
modify the process to obtain another

305
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:08,339
result so now for you put in order to

306
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,949
show you demo let me show you an

307
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:15,139
application when once you open it you

308
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:18,480
will get a message root of detection

309
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,120
what I want to do is to bypass this root

310
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,220
detection so when I open this up a

311
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:29,379
message pop in and with this message

312
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,360
the application will shut down but I

313
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,930
don't want the application just to shut

314
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,990
down or exit but I don't want to exit I

315
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:40,750
want to continue using I want to hook in

316
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:44,200
this function how do i hooking this

317
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:49,390
function I open a terminal and I say

318
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:53,620
Frieda Frieda I launch a JavaScript in a

319
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:56,350
file and I said feature click instead of

320
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,770
system exit I asked not to do anything

321
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,649
because the features changed

322
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:07,060
I launched Frieda and I said okay

323
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:08,710
unclick was modified so because this was

324
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:12,550
modified I can go back to the

325
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:14,590
application you detect this and you can

326
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:19,020
continue this is hooking the process

327
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:33,820
using freedom so what happens Frieda is

328
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:37,450
very useful tool but with objections so

329
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:42,810
but this vacation has been in a terminal

330
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:53,500
for example skipping the SSL pinning

331
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:58,899
function with this objection the

332
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:01,510
application and why this apk I mean not

333
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,750
the application I can patch the apk I

334
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:08,290
have a root device I can even launched a

335
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:12,400
free the survey process for the cooking

336
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:16,149
but I need to have the Rudi device

337
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,790
before if the and the device have good

338
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:22,210
detection no long nothing can be done so

339
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,550
we can use a library that is injected

340
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:30,160
into the application to be able to

341
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:35,610
execute this allows me to patch this ap

342
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:38,410
key ok and use other option debug or

343
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,699
network security office or something

344
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:44,750
else

345
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:46,670
add this so when the minutia asked me do

346
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,910
you wanna patch the application with

347
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:52,040
Frieda and in stall objection and use

348
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,520
cooking for the application yes or now

349
00:19:52,040 --> 00:20:01,010
but also I would like to add network

350
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:03,790
security conflict because from version 7

351
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,790
have a nindroid

352
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:10,459
to make an application to go through the

353
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,699
book superseded if this is not included

354
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,540
in the application nothing will be done

355
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:20,500
this was implemented by Google Android 7

356
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:23,750
version on but this is not very secure

357
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:31,480
actually because the idea is to within

358
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:31,480
the Android manifest our main file

359
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:40,880
application and we security setup our

360
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:48,260
application the following thing to do is

361
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:51,460
to add this file and this is the example

362
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:55,610
given by Google for you to add this

363
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,970
security is specificity and we need to

364
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:01,070
indicate with certificate use for each

365
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,820
activity the problem is that we can

366
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:07,189
modify that we can say that the file is

367
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,560
gonna be this and take all the

368
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:13,310
certificates of the user system so this

369
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:16,480
is automatically done by the application

370
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:23,629
what else can we do we can activate

371
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:26,060
debug in order to debug and the

372
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:29,330
applications are never TIF the debug

373
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:33,260
flat is not activated this function will

374
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:38,770
not be activated either so if I select

375
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:43,280
this option they add android tobacco

376
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:46,480
equal true and they say if the tool the

377
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,520
tool ask if I want to setup the apk

378
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,810
within the device device and launch

379
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,780
objection

380
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:57,050
so and at the end of the day what I'm

381
00:21:53,780 --> 00:22:01,100
doing in an audit is next next next next

382
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:03,379
step by step that's how I have an

383
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,409
environment to start editing in only

384
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:09,170
five minutes and like I said before it

385
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:13,640
will launch objections in the terminal

386
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:16,190
we delete completely delete the

387
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:21,440
verification of SSL paying for the

388
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:23,750
application and lastly you can raise

389
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,460
aprox proxy because if we want to

390
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,740
analyze the application we have

391
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,500
objection for hooking the patched

392
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,040
version but we can stop the

393
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:37,720
communication of this application so

394
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,720
proxied is raised

395
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:53,330
this is a public tool so we don't have

396
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:56,390
them establish setup so you need to

397
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:58,669
start this at the beginning for this to

398
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,740
listen the different phases to the

399
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:04,070
different so this is the basic process

400
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:07,900
of an audio but more functional

401
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:14,330
functions or features are possible

402
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:18,170
static analysis with the Mara tool I can

403
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:22,760
also have the opportunity to the device

404
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:25,160
and to launch itself that will allow me

405
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:34,580
to have access to the terminal and the

406
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:40,460
terminal will be in the end also Rudy so

407
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:43,419
this is a virtual Oba for you to see how

408
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,420
we can have access

409
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:06,639
Oh okey it's um

410
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:10,600
I mean it's behind me it's gonna be

411
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:21,340
difficult but okay so we have the

412
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:23,139
terminal here and we have to launch the

413
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,919
meet command

414
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:30,130
so there's a very interaction here and

415
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,790
then like I said before you have these

416
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:37,870
two possibilities from the beginning

417
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:42,340
delete or other options so I asked the

418
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:45,699
system to see the first option so once

419
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,590
the other starts the question will be

420
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,730
what do you want what kind of emulator

421
00:24:47,590 --> 00:25:00,790
do you want a physical okay so we will

422
00:24:51,730 --> 00:25:02,790
use Android tix enter here we are with

423
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:10,270
that with the terminal with an Android

424
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:14,560
terminal now what happens then the tool

425
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:18,150
will ask me if I want a patch the

426
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,149
process I want to add it with freedom

427
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:32,290
these apk another security feature for

428
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:36,100
proxy yes do you want debug this

429
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:38,320
application as well yes and then the

430
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:42,480
question is what kind of application or

431
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,480
what application which application

432
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:50,580
sorry I couldn't see that very well

433
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,330
because it it's behind me so I have to

434
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,439
start over again

435
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,439
sorry about that

436
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:29,468
okay so here we are terminal has been

437
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:32,499
shown so following steps are not made up

438
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:34,809
until the device and absolutely detects

439
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:39,190
that the device is connected to the SSL

440
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:43,779
system so if so this should be activated

441
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:46,629
because the application takes the

442
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:49,389
architecture of our device to put the

443
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:52,809
apk so depending of the kind of reading

444
00:26:49,389 --> 00:27:01,830
we will have it will take one part of

445
00:26:52,809 --> 00:27:06,219
the other so so using frida catch a yes

446
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:14,559
so configuration having time I mean

447
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:20,409
setup Frieda yes so I have the mega mega

448
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:22,649
five setup and it is patching things it

449
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:25,359
takes a little while and then after

450
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:28,209
patching things the question is do you

451
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,509
want to setup and install the apk in the

452
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,509
device

453
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:44,800
but but I okay it's next screen shows up

454
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:47,740
meaning the apk has been patched so you

455
00:27:44,800 --> 00:28:00,550
need you want to install this apk in the

456
00:27:47,740 --> 00:28:03,040
device yes and to avoid failure and then

457
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,560
and stops it again and then they launch

458
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,570
it and why is that because now the

459
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:12,399
question will be if I want to check

460
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:17,100
share after patching ap Caid of the

461
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:21,040
Egyptian it starts to think and wait

462
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:24,219
until it sees that everything has been

463
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:31,629
connected even with the objections and

464
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:40,560
the only thing to do is indicate Android

465
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:40,560
SSL pinning disable okay if you high

you have should change save changes but

473
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:33,290
I open project and I just need to tell

in fact right here test test and I go I

478
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:18,050
have escaped there is a pinion I have

479
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:21,909
everything activated and it detects oh

480
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,909
well but then it shows up here

481
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,350
maybe there isn't internet connection

482
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,350
right now

483
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:54,420
because indeed I am without internet

case anybody start with the car already

I have a proxy and I can do that
