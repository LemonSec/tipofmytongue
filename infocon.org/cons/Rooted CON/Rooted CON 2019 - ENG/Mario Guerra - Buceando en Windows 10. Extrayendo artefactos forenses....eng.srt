1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:09,629
good morning everybody and thanks I see

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,809
that the next room next door is full and

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:17,279
that's why you came here

4
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:19,710
I'm working the side of the fence into

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,140
it left and to the right they will fight

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:29,699
belong to did you tell the investigation

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:32,308
are we basically do forensics also deal

8
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,950
with mobile devices forensic and other

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:40,519
devices that may come along today

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:47,039
introduction deals with forensic

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:49,500
development in Windows 10 all that well

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,230
documented that Microsoft works on a

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
black box approach with their system and

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,730
you have to go on your own to be able to

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,140
make the presentation like today's but

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,660
it's basically for our day-to-day work

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,170
how do you have done foreign seek

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:08,670
investigation okay quite a lot so you

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,619
know what I'm talking about we might see

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,580
that the system have to analyze is the

21
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:17,310
victim that is they they intruded or

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,490
something has happened that was not done

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,900
by the user correctly done by the user

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,640
or the other way around

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,060
perhaps or Steve is a team which piece

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,829
of equipment in which the user has

27
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:37,049
manipulated in a malicious way be to

28
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,939
commit a crime or whatever so this car

29
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:43,350
from different periods because they

30
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:47,699
forensics for the forensic will be very

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,039
useful to know what they have to do if

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,689
they if it's a compromised a computer or

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,880
the computers being years to do

34
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,740
something going on and then we can it

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,509
depends on the environment as well we

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,399
can be forensic for the corporate

37
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,380
environment in my case we're talking

38
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,110
about our own computers of our own

39
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,380
network

40
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,539
you have administrator privileges where

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,869
you can access remotely and get the

42
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,720
evidence remotely in our case you users

43
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:15,610
usually collaborate when there is an

44
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,800
investigation in nineteen ninety five

45
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,770
percent of cases the computers have been

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,810
infected so you have to analyze them

47
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,190
where are saying those where there is a

48
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,840
court order

49
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:31,079
it tends to be the other way around

50
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,080
there is an investigation in progress

51
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:39,010
devices are part of the investigation of

52
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:41,110
a crime and in those cases they users

53
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,420
will refuse to declare and use the right

54
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,970
it's a remain silent and they will not

55
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,399
help out so the type of investigation

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,959
gets complicated in a different way and

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,780
that's sometimes somebody comes along

58
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,350
and the computer is from a friend and

59
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,520
that's giving it to me so that you can

60
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:03,190
remove the password and be able to

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,050
access to it so I have a shame the type

62
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,600
of user has been working with the

63
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:11,380
computer makes a big difference most

64
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,510
users unfortunately are native without

65
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,510
the digital they use the computer

66
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,149
without my knowledge and in a way they

67
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,420
make investigation easier for people who

68
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,160
are doing the court investigations

69
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,429
because they are not aware of how much

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,170
window locks in the use of a computer so

71
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,430
you can get a lot of evidence or they

72
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:36,100
are sort of careless and they open in an

73
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:41,019
email with a phishing attack so in both

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,730
cases to generate the evidence because

75
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:46,630
they have done a lot of things without

76
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:50,018
cleaning up after after the fact when

77
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,790
they forensic will find it's an easy job

78
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,340
it's easy to find information about what

79
00:03:51,790 --> 00:04:00,930
happened then we have the brother-in-law

80
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:06,180
level here also known as

81
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:11,159
the corporate user who wants to use

82
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:19,620
their repository to look at film so they

83
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:21,539
want to set up a VPN to be films the

84
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,210
problem with this type of people is that

85
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,949
they've read a lot of and different see

86
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,049
techniques and in many cases they are

87
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,300
going to apply part of the techniques of

88
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,599
course because they've only read about

89
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,560
part of the commands not all of them

90
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:40,139
because it reading is painful their

91
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,419
investigation can take a bit longer but

92
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,419
if it gets tough and then there's day

93
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:57,660
they cannot so in this case isn't in the

94
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:05,460
prior ones that use carry and other

95
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:09,270
things and if I write commando V M which

96
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,310
is a virtual environment for PCs but

97
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,810
which is another way of doing in the

98
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,030
Windows environment is another way of

99
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,539
doing pen testing and you could use it

100
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:24,239
to I analyze this machine with

101
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:26,130
penetration capacity when it comes to

102
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,080
collecting evidence because sometimes

103
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,479
you have to go and collect the evidence

104
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,169
it doesn't always come to you you can

105
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,820
find the system on and without blocking

106
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:39,479
and that's great because you can do

107
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,430
plenty of things alive you can record in

108
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,070
video while you're doing stuff you avoid

109
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:48,599
many problems that the operating systems

110
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:52,310
may have in terms of security you have

111
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:55,110
access to everything and the credentials

112
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,360
to connect the cloud if they are in the

113
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,550
system you can see where they're surfing

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,460
and

115
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,650
that's the ideal case and then you can

116
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,609
do a crash up and take a copy of the

117
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:11,179
disk to your home so that's the great

118
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,730
way to get the most of the situation if

119
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,070
it's all but it's broke then we start

120
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,620
finding problems there have been times

121
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,960
in history but there have been magic

122
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,810
devices to do aggressive pen testing you

123
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,729
could have blocked screens jump them

124
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,940
over and access the system but usually

125
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:31,430
if if it's a user of the corporation

126
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,670
they've done nothing wrong then they

127
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,830
will allow you to to debug the system

128
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,720
but what the user it does not want to

129
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:43,130
collaborate then we're in trouble

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,200
as of today South has incorporated with

131
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:49,040
those hello biometric measures to

132
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,810
practice them and like in many cases

133
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,500
they were presenting things of how to do

134
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:58,190
a wipe a bypass of Windows hello P

135
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,260
digital brains or facial print but

136
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,810
you're not in the right environment that

137
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:09,140
people use for the demos if the computer

138
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:11,830
is off and not cypher you compare with

139
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:16,539
your corner and you took that long to

140
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:21,680
your lab but most people have learned a

141
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:25,280
bit about about cybersecurity and

142
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,370
decipher the hard disk but if you take

143
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,679
that copy then you cannot analyze

144
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:34,810
anything because you're not going to be

145
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:38,210
able to decide there are also different

146
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,980
levels of depth to do forensics some

147
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,520
people say they're do forensics but they

148
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:46,730
actually do quite superficial stuff and

149
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:51,830
they have like a big bottom tool they

150
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:56,060
index everything in that tool if it's a

151
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:59,539
pain tool they had more out that in the

152
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,040
free one but that's all unfortunately

153
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,380
there are many things that you do have

154
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,480
to analyze deeper down if you really

155
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,980
want to do an investigation particularly

156
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,040
with the analysis of malware because you

157
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:15,670
because there's a topic of documents and

158
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,610
you you want to know what the sample is

159
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:21,940
or liked when tools are not included

160
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,940
within the forensics suite you have to

161
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,219
do it by hand to see how the Tool Works

162
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,790
to be able to purge the artifacts well

163
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:42,760
in alignment usually I wouldn't be made

164
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:45,670
up by and make software destination hard

165
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,370
drives drivers maybe attempt to get

166
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,890
narrow traffic don't we feed to see

167
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,920

we also have the possibility families

and bistro to get certain things with

tools that work in forensic analysis it

186
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,410
depends on what you wanna do when

187
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,610
commercially speaking the forensic reads

188
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,610

Microsoft Excel you're assessing files

massive files of ft and you might need a

massive spreadsheet and a Google is

195
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:30,380
always useful but you find something

196
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:41,620
unusual and it's always good to check to

197
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:41,620
ask what may be or may be used by this

whoever began a campaign against you

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:05,630
that you got them and then you need to

205
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:09,490
get money for training and analyst

206
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,490
timing to get trained on the wrong

207
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,410
we need to have the ability to get

208
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,180
trained in a short period of time and

209
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,129
then regard is certifying for action if

comes to presenting a frenetic statement

214

imagine and size does matter why because

215
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,939
most computers in the world do use

216
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,060
windows so it is very likely that if you

217
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:45,279
get a computer in your lab you probably

218
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:50,229
have windows because he were talking

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:57,189
about computers most of people's lives

220
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:59,170
is to have I also reference the

221

capabilities on score I'll focus in on

the problem with Windows 10 well

228
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:25,110
Microsoft decided no no change this is

again in with big windows since July 15

ending April 2019 and merely up to four

231
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,170
years we have been to many versions here

232
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:41,230
just years

233
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:43,809
I'm a probably half 1903 for us to see

it volunteer hours and those events are

235
00:12:43,809 --> 00:13:00,368
not here last month under my house bad

236
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:02,139
habit of touching things and you do the

237
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:04,419
Union before so you need to validate

238
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:06,730
your knowledge of those things are still

239
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:08,829
applying the current working those

have a correlative that what we guess

also happening with the version with

find Windows to go if you know about it

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,649
you may have a magic us be working that

252
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:44,739
you know this has to know is particular

253
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:46,660
is the versions of 32 and 64 bits when

find there's gonna be an S mode for each

Alicia I think they're just about to

261
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,799
announce 15 so Microsoft abandoned the

262
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,410
sample site it works like the black

263
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:22,660
beans every six months we have no

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:24,670
artifacts a prize every time he was a

265
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,379
major up left he's like updating the

266
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,559
parentheses in France France

267
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:31,179
it kills his version date of the system

268
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,618
so that was everything so now whether a

269
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:35,709
computer have been working for a while

270
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:37,629
so that disappears eliminates of events

271
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,118
on the system in the world so would just

272
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:42,100
kills a memory so you're a forensic

273

want to eat I mean how long the

intrusion house being in the system we

277
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:59,369

expecting people to post on github

it manually

you can see a number of folders that

affect the 36 of and you cannot refer to

were shot here here's Kela though there

was 2500 euros he's hardly the evidence

would help so you can find all sorts of

perspective one of the main ones is

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:41,930
there is a saturation as a forensic

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,690
many people here are our experience so

334
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,750
I'm gonna go quickly on theirs because

335
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,370
we don't talk about the policies

336
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,100
ourselves you know we're losing energy

337
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:34,790
affairs and the main evidence here is

338
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:37,219
I'm of deep that refers to everything

339
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,930
that is happening in the system the

340
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,090
system works with generally registering

341
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,370
everything that happens and frantically

342
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,379
speaking that is one of the first things

343
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,060
you need to assess there have been

344
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,880
changes in the current versions of the

345
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:54,290
system these are things that we need to

346
00:18:49,880 --> 00:19:08,000
explain them however are not adhering

347
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:12,260
yellow party nursing important so right

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,170
now all these six terabytes of our disks

349
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,180
are for what area for Kerry sectors if

350
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,620
you don't take that into account when it

351
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,930
comes to parse in the hard drives you

352
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,810
cannot get good evidence now we need to

353
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:25,300
highlight this regarding you

354
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:28,210
the new things we have no system about

355
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:34,480
sewing ideas we can find many more

356
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:37,360
things and maybe here in their copies

357
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:42,100
Yana is here like to get information

358
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,889
even though most attached to that bear

359
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,679
says you don't know information in fact

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:13,450
might need 32-bit machines to work well

with this

thinking and without cash they're my

368
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:31,750
problem they have windows that is 14.8

369
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:35,020
points tools that get updated with the

370
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:38,050
passing of uncashed with Windows 7 so

371
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:42,280
you need to look at the tool developers

372
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:45,550
for the objective - the developer two or

373
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,590
three years ago stopped advancing with

374
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:51,580
the tool and the last one on a pass is

375
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,620
Windows 7 so budem recommended using

376
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,770
Windows having tools on Windows that

377
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:59,439
because may be similar but not that may

378
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:01,800
be errors in the usage of incorrect

Windows Explorer we have helper objects

Microsoft edge browser we know some new

383
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:22,669
and have those objects and directs

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:25,310
location capability in some samples

385
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:38,390
maybe a party today because there's no

in cloud even if you have several

389

devices which is the aim of how people

work on the cloud you may find device

argue the world of X erect so

392
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,680
application we use the commands are the

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,200
first ones to open the same ones you

394
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,880
open play tend to offer advice that's

395
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,820
because information goes to Microsoft

396
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,900
servers the applications really against

397
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:14,870
our servers to obtain that information

398
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,640
therefore the new codes we get these

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,489
ones here

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,560
transfer course and already recovered

401
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,570
well we were there reading the system

402
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,080
but you know where they need to get

403
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,419
those files recommended for the user in

404
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:33,080
each application has its own sake and

405

this is new in the latest version we can

also show the using tensioner a similar

407
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:48,290
type Vance it is a good way of detecting

nationality we want I play forensics

409
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,180
like masters level you cannot integrate

410
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,879
the transaction law so there are these

411
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,710
three these works like a database you

412
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,190
have to fasten the system working which

413
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,920
one's actually text files then upload

414
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:08,480
information what against the registry

415
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:10,310
whatever there is this work you can

416
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,760
really registry sometimes informations

417
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:18,169
not uploaded malware files or if you

418
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:21,410
assess those from sectional element such

419
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:26,650
changes you see mal were lost except on

the type of them example never try scene

421

sometimes you don't find anything

422
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,760
you shouldn't think disruptively to find

423
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,010
a solution to the problem sometimes some

424
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,970
places

425
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:42,400
Thompson forensics to look for evidence

426
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:45,510
sometimes is worth to do it because it's

427
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,510
the only way to find something

428
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:59,790
Microsoft's or has challenged they have

429
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:04,260
the wrong evidence implants windows hey

430
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:07,260
have you here because they help me

00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:28,780
system in the classic control panel

434
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,780
windows you get a different thing than

435
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:34,450
with the keyboard combination new

436
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,680
combination shows you the ones you saw

437
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,620
that the ones are loaded from the

438
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,120
Windows Store if you go to the former

439
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:45,310
panel the ones in the store and I'll

440
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:48,760
show you the file from the database or

441
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:50,889
through PowerShell commands so the

442
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,570
system will give you back information on

443
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:56,200
the applications is sort of resolving

444
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:58,179
the system a forensic is life and you

445
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,640
can alter the system you might need to

446
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:03,110
do the script it take it to tax filers

have incentive to dad

448
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,830
you may be able to go to database access

449
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,900
it so there are no legal problems here

450
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,449
and the best possible scenario is to

451
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,520
harbor be turned on without blocking it

452
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:18,920
because you can do everything you have a

453
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:22,090
mutation to investigate okay so we get

454

your 20 adding the appraisal system did

459
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,900
thing was people wanted to have a vs

the last one is interest

you can take mechanical objects or peak

objects so they cannot be moved you can

pin pinned objects your generator told

00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:58,200
begins through their code which other

479
00:26:54,299 --> 00:27:01,830
novelties is Microsoft well we have so

as an opportunity

they synchronize a large amount by sense

deciphering objects we've only the

488

clipboard online looking directly the

489
00:27:49,880 --> 00:28:02,220
plants or the combination combination or

490
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:04,550
you can try society and here you have

do that

00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:51,429
basically you find text type Street be a

500
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:55,679
file name was basically the file so we

501
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,679
can see the local ownership in files

502
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,320
decide for us I think that was he for

503
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:04,760
answer Philippe's finally selecting this

504
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,159
computer Demelza raffia Fonzarelli

505
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,590
really marked with a JSON Associated

506
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,840
under the hyperlink may also be probably

507
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,270
generating three or four five three

508
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,659
things far as the normal HTML HTML

509
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:22,330
format no file so internally Microsoft

510
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:27,470
keeps way of signaling that it's a link

511
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:33,530
we have is another feature included

512
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:36,280
fronting is one and this is a prefetch

513
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,280
alternative

514
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:46,250
prefetch allows you do you know forensic

515
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:50,090
Li whether an application has being

516
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:54,650
executed in the system so these feature

517
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:58,659
associated - two - two files and I use

518
00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:00,260
that word persistent controllers there -

519
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,060
ready to pounce

520
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,550
so you go to the sub key of use of

521
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,500
settings and King health information and

522
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,600
then you have the Thomas Thomas they

523
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,180
need to convert

524
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,750
this is a student I see for the date

525
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:19,760
format and multiple bounty to the human

526
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:23,150
four months you can see the evidence of

527
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,700
what happened in the system thanks to

528
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:32,030
these forensic artifact they were having

529
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:34,310
no infertility did bother to erase the

530
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:39,230
previous evidence

531
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:43,360
Alicia sample they don't know exists and

532
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:47,680
they're leaving a trace as well dance

533
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,330
with every swampy area to do forensic

534
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,520
analysis there is a small difference we

535
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:54,379
they finished our summers they need to

536
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,120
know this because only comes something

537
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:01,700
of your ants analysis we need assistance

538
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,239
because legally speaking that could be a

539
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:08,570
problem so we need to know that there's

540
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,940
a difference in a minute between the

541
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,399
tongue to set of exams of execution time

542
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,170
but if we use from Sasha Roxanne purse

543
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,970
we were saying earlier that time

544
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:20,190
difference is recyclable

545
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:22,620
so he's much more proximal

546
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,760
regarding the persecution time between

547
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,760
prefetch and the bomb

548
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:36,240
regarding tunnelled is another feature

549
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:37,890
aversion 8003 just want you all it's

550
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,020
very comfortable to have this kind of

551
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:44,910
part of your activity this is my

552
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,710
granular from the system when he gives

553
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:54,410
you our obligation our browsing activity

554
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:58,020
but as we all know it looks more like to

555
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:00,240
recoup our to compile information but

556
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,299
it's not extremely useful you can also

557
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,330
have access to these three combinations

558
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:09,540
and if the computers are right we should

559
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:18,120
bury those how to try to assess the user

560
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:29,809
how all these ghosts risk we have a

561
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:29,809
database to endow some forensics

562
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:44,060
to the commands to process the evidence

563
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:47,480
which to use here in the information

564
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:49,220
timeline right now everything the

565
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,260
presents Microsoft other information

566
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,470
regarding without a minute all that

567
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:58,040
appears there I was useful information

568
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:00,200
you to process if someone applying some

569
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:08,629
different things and they don't know if

570
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:13,070
they need to kill the activities you

571
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:17,480
have yet another tools work with them by

572
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:20,389
the way I'm clear if you clean the fifty

573
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,750
years from the system and panel those

574
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:27,740
not eliminating countersued activities

575
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:30,920
cash a DVD file it only cleans was you

576
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:34,580
shop the so we hear something some

577
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:37,930
people love about database is a quite a

578
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:40,790
few many fees are maybe so information

579
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:44,390
obviously need to pass the time time you

580
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:46,280
might get a great here of the

581
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:49,350
information you may get in all if all

582
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:52,870
fields are filled out

583
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:59,529
novalee llamas is here today he has a

584
00:33:52,870 --> 00:34:01,479
tool called recovers khilafat which is

585
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:04,990
very interesting for these four Anson

586
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,120
County families this the lifetime of

587
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:18,820
this evidence is 30 days so we have a

588
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:21,879
city might be enough depending on what

589
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:26,649
the Chronicle Committee limitation of

590
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:28,000
the actual system is there we need to

591
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:30,250
know what those limitations make you

592
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,960
some more times the log is cut off for a

593
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,089
certain apology you know about the

594
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:38,260
system parameters but we found these

595
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:43,020
kind of things we also have a recent

596
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:47,740
arms is a registry key a new user that I

597
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:50,050
found before Windows that OS that gives

598
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:52,979
a hierarchical structure of more

599
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,980
relaxing system

600
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:02,790
but from the forensics perspective we

601
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:15,430
need to be careful in information we get

602
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:18,400
because we cannot conclude how if you

603
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:20,980
take it - but if you cannot show - like

604
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,200
the edges as we've said before at least

605
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,720
look at the rest of the way so I don't

606
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,370
new evidence and check whether this

607
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,009
information is valid this is not very

608
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:32,680
precise Microsoft uses it for a user

609
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:34,900
experience what is not without forensic

610
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,379
evidence is that it's 100% reliable than

611
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,200
a wall

612
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,860
I'm saying that because when people have

613
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:45,430
a counter evidence then all these things

614
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:47,500
they trying to talk to a time trial

615
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:51,600
until you find your gaps and this is one

616
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,600
of them we have the power

617
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,779
examples and why straight rows use

618
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:02,360
partially because she broke taxes so

619
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:08,240
here we'll go to the history empty

620
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:12,380
contacts file from version 3 young 4060

621
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,060
mounting system these basis is very

622
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:25,850
important for information without in

623
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:29,360
what may have to accept his warm for now

624
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:33,290
she'll another one for power shall I see

625
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:36,200
what are the money kept independently

626
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:39,830
the system so you should actually get

627
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:48,919
both here we have a issue of the

628
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:53,810
commands of show he got an idea for a

629
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,970
good idea when things happen but things

630
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:58,430
happen regarding more were of malicious

631
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:01,850
users for the types of research for

632
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:05,230
ingredients that impede this type of

633
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,230
evidence is not useful

634
00:37:07,930 --> 00:38:08,140
a statement about it is funny so he'd

635
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,570
maybe some boxes

636
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:20,160
well surprise you may have access to

637
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:20,160
education senator Rosie access

638
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:30,830
that's quite interesting travel because

639
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:33,230
it also retained every male is it

640
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:40,700
Windows the final message or something

641
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:42,170
something they asked me that we maybe be

642
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,089
able to show the attention of the user

643
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,940
tutorial in action that's really

644
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:49,670
important legally no but I mean that

645
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:57,770
there are tools that forces that help us

646
00:38:49,670 --> 00:39:00,980
person in an automatic way warnings are

647
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:06,350
the alert and this is a way of reading

648
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:08,390
it these are the register Keys that

649
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:13,310
control the configuration of the center

650
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:15,770
around the connected images are stored

651
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:18,080
here we can see that there is a picture

652
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:20,390
of the notification and the system

653
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,630
defines the road for this system kids

654
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:27,370
you can read the qualifier and access to

655
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:29,660
the system file for your story they

656
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,210
covered lighted evidence and the time

657
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:34,190
stamps are important from the forensic

658
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:40,040
people to know when things have happened

659
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:44,900
to have a proper timeline we have the

660
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:48,440
file notifications are stored as we are

661
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:52,040
working this type of everything you can

662
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,160
access the file directory the first

663
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:59,740
window versions were with a binary file

664
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:02,859
called beeping dot dat that seems the

665
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:06,189
16:07 they changed the

666
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:09,220
but database they included the file

667
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:14,820
SQLite and included the what you can see

668
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:19,240
in this cried which with this s cool

669
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:24,490
tool you can parse it and you so this is

670
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:26,439
more work it's harder to know what

671
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:37,259
information you need rather than take

672
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:39,970
everything these are the user attention

673
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,170
agents that are introducing are being

674
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,609
introduced all over the place some

675
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:46,090
people find them useful from the

676
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:48,250
viewpoint from the forensic viewpoint it

677
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:53,050
is relatively important and you will see

678
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:55,660
why next it integrates the user contacts

679
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,880
within the truth it takes a lot of

680
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:03,250
information and collects a lot of user

681
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:05,470
information and in no way can be taken

682
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:07,120
to third parties in Microsoft says

683
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,910
that's very clear it's open only

684
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:15,910
therefore for Cortana and for forensics

685
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:18,279
and futures whoever is that the computer

686
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:21,730
remove the sound but nevertheless you

687
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,440
get you get this message through the

688
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:28,190
speakers

689
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:31,430
you get this this way Cortana fright say

690
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:33,380
hi I'm Cara so this is the compilation

691
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:36,589
of information collected as I were

692
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:40,010
saying even with the blocked screen this

693
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:44,029
is working and there are people who

694
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:47,690
believe this is violation of privacy but

695
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:50,560
we suppose the system uses it sort of

696
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:56,330
legitimately so it's just information

697
00:41:50,560 --> 00:42:02,839
compilation related are the factors that

698
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:06,200
this database Cortana will have to limit

699
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:09,580
ourselves to framework and advocate for

700
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:13,430
whatever the research or data stores

701
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:15,920
which Wi-Fi you have a connected from

702
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,140
last time I don't know why it keeps not

703
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,720
information but from the forensic spear

704
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,450
point you know house you to know when

705
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,689
was the last time that you've connected

706
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:29,060
with a computer to a Wi-Fi if you're at

707
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:31,730
home that doesn't make much sense but if

708
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:39,680
you're talking about mobile computers it

709
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:45,339
helps to locate somebody and then the

710
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:48,230
tasks that were defined or which also

711
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:50,440
defines intentionality in terms of the

712
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,440
user

713
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:56,419
16:07 Microsoft as I was saying changed

714
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,849
the system that Cortana was usually and

715
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,710
since it's been sending everything to

716
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:04,369
the cloud so the information that you

717
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:07,190
can get is from foreign forensics it's a

718
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:09,530
is limited in Prior versions you have

719
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,810
more information so you know which

720
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,369
version you're working with to see if

721
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:14,960
you can have to waste time looking for

722
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:18,950
that information or it's not the page

723
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:23,000
not worthwhile about the microphone it

724
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:26,029
has some temporary files of a zero so it

725
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,580
doesn't make sense to go to zero to go

726
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:30,890
to that but if you manage to use the to

727
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,319
find the library that is using you could

728
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,348
pick the

729
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:39,390
they'd float and try flow and try to use

730
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:41,859
that to parse the information onedrive

731
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:44,950
we all know what it is it's one of the

732
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:46,480
storage tools for information available

733
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,759
for a cloud

734
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,369
it's Microsoft's and it's integrated in

735
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,260
the system they do not force you to use

736
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:56,880
it but but it's all over the place

737
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:59,530
allows you do it's integrated with the

738
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,079
with the office ideas are very

739
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:05,670
comfortable for the user to work with it

740
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:09,040
and therefore as I was saying native

741
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:10,660
users in affected Commons are the ones

742
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,390
that are going to use these solutions

743
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:16,799
because it's easy to save there so it's

744
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:19,779
a place where probably in terms of the

745
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,250
documentary investigation for the second

746
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,530
best equation there's probably a lot of

747
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,450
information there their problem with all

748
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:29,200
of this information in cloud is that

749
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:32,259
there are different types of way of ways

750
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,200
of working in the cloud you can work as

751
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:38,619
a local copy as well download us on the

752
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,379
first huge or to open it directly and

753
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:43,210
route so even if you see that it's in

754
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:45,700
that is it may happen that the file is

755
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,109
not there so if you do not have the

756
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,000
credentials of the user is not

757
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:50,799
collaborating in that case you will not

758
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,040
have access and you're going to need a

759
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,099
court order to demand access to that

760
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:03,460
local account and it's very difficult to

761
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:07,630
get that information that way this type

762
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:10,500
of cloud storage probably has other

763
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:13,619
devices the

764
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,180
a computer with a microphone perhaps

765
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:21,540
it's easier to access that information

766
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:24,629
from the other device or sometimes acts

767
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:28,890
I accessed the mobile phone from the

768
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:32,910
computer so this is by default saved in

769
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:35,279
the onedrive file of the user in you can

770
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,259
see if you know how to configure it the

771
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:42,510
logs and what files to analyze you could

772
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:47,790
try to do an interpolation of the truth

773
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:51,869
you shall know that there is a frequent

774
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:54,329
update of the use files if a computer

775
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:56,160
stops connecting at a point in time and

776
00:45:54,329 --> 00:46:00,420
that the working time of a person you

777
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:03,930
can define that that person that's good

778
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,880
to make the temporary correlation when

779
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,848
that person stopped having the machine

780
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,650
stopped having the machine on and if you

781
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,390
correlate the the other things that

782
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:13,950
we've mentioned everyone with Cortana

783
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,920
and so on you can say that somebody

784
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:22,169
disappear approximately around this time

785
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:25,079
in onedrive for business for some reason

786
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:27,089
it touches the heading of the files or

787
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:29,130
stored on the server side so when you

788
00:46:27,089 --> 00:46:33,900
heart the local with server they don't

789
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:37,490
much and that's it for that the main

790
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:41,900
tool and I'm almost done this is the

791
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:45,240
mail tool they included by default for

792
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:48,240
Microsoft since Windows I hate since

793
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,339
when Windows 10 it's changed the way

794
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,810
their tool works a lot of people don't

795
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:54,060
use it but it's much more one more

796
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:57,089
include in the system and in Windows 8

797
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:01,440
they use the format ml 4 to store the

798
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:07,360
emails and in 10 if you say HTML or

799
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:11,690
other or txt and it uses

800
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:13,400
this system with more SAP files 3 & 7

801
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:17,680
are the ones that are of interest for us

802
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:21,800
0 it's called itis Windows Phone and in

803
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:26,109
the top computer a tabletop computer is

804
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,700
not used in the 3 & 7 we have the

805
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:32,030
relevant information from the forensic

806
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:36,230
viewpoint it generates a files with

807
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:38,540
these characters it's a bit of entire

808
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:45,560
sample you can see how you can access

809
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:49,220
information 3 are the other files HTML

810
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:51,380
and the 7 are annexes and the database

811
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:54,080
with this location is the one that makes

812
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:57,500
the correlation between the evidence of

813
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,869
the text emails and the an accessor and

814
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:02,960
this database is easy to analyze it's

815
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:06,020
only 63 in 10 and analyzer so it's quite

816
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,450
small it's one has HTML tables and you

817
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:10,990
have to focus you know the approaches in

818
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:14,060
the right way because usually when these

819
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,950
databases subscribe to other majors at

820
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:18,049
the bottom are more than enough for the

821
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,339
forensic analysis you don't need to

822
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,410
analyze the whole of the database

823
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,640
because with part of it you would

824
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:25,790
probably have more than enough

825
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,770
information and that's all I think I

826
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:30,680
have not gone beyond my time I want to

827
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:32,780
thank you once more for coming yeah and

828
