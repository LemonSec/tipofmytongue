00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,960
this is a talk that is great for the

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,470
place we're in they're going to talk

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:49,410
about film we have with us

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:52,860
Francisco Jose he has computer and

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,610
masters in safety of the information

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,820
technologies and since a 2017 works in

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,060
Monica and the team crazy ideas and

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,550
collaborate with Luca in Nevada he's

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,210
also a research journalist he's a

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,310
co-founder of a journal such as how to

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,919
fulfill one magazine wanna carve another

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,759
media and right now he works with a

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,990
great team in the publication of rebus

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,990
Tasik who's a leading

27
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:32,430
welcome oh I want to think that for

28
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:36,140
offering us this space there's a great

29
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,399
honor to participate in the 10th your

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,500
birthday party and we're gonna talk

31
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:46,289
about movies and hackers film can be

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,869
considered hacker technology to the

33
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:51,899
extender it creates an intuition or

34
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,670
something that doesn't exist and it it's

35
00:01:51,899 --> 00:02:00,000
a passion for us and it fills us with

36
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:03,470
curiosity and it surprises us the fiber

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,149
history of the large of the big screen

38
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:11,810
us those of us would believe about

39
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,810
cybersecurity

40
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:23,610
much I choose these films our

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:29,430
expectations about the cyber Paducah but

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:32,550
before we start we're going to spoil do

43
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,860
a lot of spoilers I'm also gonna have to

44
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:40,020
put up with a lot of a pixel you never

45
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,209
saw something films are a bit old in the

46
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:47,459
last 30 years and the spoiler effect

47
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:50,250
won't be so serious so here we have

48
00:02:47,459 --> 00:03:01,410
August and lewiston yeah we believe they

49
00:02:50,250 --> 00:03:04,530
are the first hackers in history to

50
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:08,100
achieve a dream that's a lot of people

51
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:13,170
had had before which was to give

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:15,989
movement to image 20th of December is

53
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,260
the first day of the history of film

54
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:24,390
they projected in a coffee and a coffee

55
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:28,828
in Paris a film entitled frame coming

56
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:33,929
from today is that look so simple to us

57
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:41,780
made viewers run away in terror thinking

58
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:41,780
that there the train you say driving so

59
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:57,890
the first effects of

60
00:03:47,390 --> 00:04:02,720
century discovered that the Revere

61
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:06,839
invention could be consider more than

62
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,260
attractions but a great art of this

63
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,050
screen with these trained will feel our

64
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:29,610
heads and our homes and we'll end up

65
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:32,820
living in this virtual world of film

66
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:37,590
came about in which computers is one of

67
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:41,849
them whether it was white computer

68
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:45,090
almost like best based on mechanical

69
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:49,650
machine from child fathers and if you

70
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:54,239
know that it's connected with a Don

71
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:59,340
Lovelace computer Polly was at the

72
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,650
beginning and absolutely necessary

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,859
because the argument is that a meteorite

74
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,330
is going to you collide with Earth and

75
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,010
the government says we can't quite

76
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,669
believe that in both entrepreneurs

77
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:14,370
decide to launch an airship to try to

78
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:17,310
save as many people as possible and

79
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:21,300
calculate the trajectory of the

80
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:24,990
meteorite they used a computer it was a

81
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,020
differential machining they gave it

82
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,710
which was the one that Ada Lovelace was

83
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:35,130
trying to promote and computers not

84
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,680
becoming more popular not only in

85
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,820
societies because at that time they made

86
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,090
I was using it

87
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:48,800
also very common in the missile nuclear

88
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:52,349
missiles and one that popularized

89
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,870
computers were say with Catherine

90
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,260
careful and Spencer Tracy who weren't

91
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,900
and are famous unable to become later on

92
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,230
in this human that's cassette where a

93
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:10,260
computer was trying to get the job of

94
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:12,450
hard rehab who was librarian came about

95
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,520
and it's one that you all should see if

96
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:18,870
you haven't seen it which is fantastic

97
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:22,830
voyage that tells or explain how an

98
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,560
engineer part of making miniatures of

99
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,479
things to the extent that they manage

100
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,520
for submarine to be small enough to be

101
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:34,590
introduced in a person's body at that

102
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:38,389
chance that the Russians and they start

103
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:47,250
fighting to see who can do that until

104
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:51,630
creator suffers a brain problem that can

105
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:55,050
only be resolved by entering his body to

106
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:58,080
save him so what's funny about the next

107
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:01,080
year if not the highest from the biggest

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:06,830
computer ever manufactured

109
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:11,669
they were showed the IBM a NFS qu7 it

110
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:16,260
had 16,000 void her tubes it was

111
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:18,659
destined to the control of the a cold

112
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:24,510
war between Russians and Americans it

113
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:28,650
waited 245 talent that was the computer

114
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:32,430
and talking about the Cold War those of

115
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:34,500
you who are interested in AI hacking

116
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,570
computers this is a film

117
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:44,010
that was a milestone it was called

118
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:46,020
Colossus defecated project and it says

119
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,870
that the United States had Russia in

120
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,419
delegate all control of their missiles

121
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,710
into artificial intelligence but the

122
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,740
problem is of the artificial

123
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,830
intelligence detects that the people in

124
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,960
charge are not responsible and both

125
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,200
machines the Russian and the American

126
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,539
one agree on gun control from people if

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,400
this is the decoration at the end of the

128
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:13,830
movie where the machines right that they

129
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,739
are going to take charge because as

130
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:27,990
humans are to destroy each other

131
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:30,060
this was that perhaps was the first one

132
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,330
to talk about artificial intelligence

133
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,400
depth so when I will begin to do the

134
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,159
hacking whether the kind hacking come

135
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,510
along well before that you have to tell

136
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,240
you that computers have been great

137
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,000
protagonists of all films and this page

138
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,890
is interesting you have the link there

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,040
you need to have time for that

140
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:56,310
what it does is it takes all film and if

141
00:08:52,040 --> 00:09:01,520
there is one single screen frame with a

142
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,520
computer and it will it will listed here

143
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:12,279
and they you know ghost chaser the the

144
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:17,980
computer is only there for a couple of

145
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:24,040
seconds the crazy police academy this is

146
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:26,619
the computer you see what about hacking

147
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,099
why are they in cybersecurity really

148
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:32,019
come about well probably with this film

149
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:36,519
it's a film that's actually accommodated

150
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:44,109
no no drama no trailer it was considered

151
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:46,029
the best comedy concept of hackers there

152
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:48,389
is not quite like the one we have right

153
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:48,389
now

154
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,970
[Music]

155
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,849
also the detective of a heart attack

156
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:11,610
this is a thief that realizes that

157
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,560
through computers can sail and can steal

158
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:18,629
a lot of money and he's there so much

159
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:22,680
money that he he then has to run away to

160
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:24,870
Brazil with the secretary and I like to

161
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:30,410
say that this is the first time that

162
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:30,410
there is an unauthorized incursion into

163
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:40,829
spectra 7 and 50 but this is this is no

164
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,470
intelligent artificial intelligence at

165
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:45,660
all in cybersecurity we always say that

166
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,660
I wanted to be very careful with the

167
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:56,519
insiders who generate 70% of the

168
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:59,219
disasters in many companies well already

169
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,230
discuss a problem but society at the

170
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,629
time that made people laugh and it was

171
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,000
rifle that I feel and and they were

172
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:09,990
picking and that was also the beginning

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,269
of the image do you believe that hackers

174
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,269
in movies much hackers in real life

175
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:23,449
blocks everything and don't just care so

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,449
in the car

177
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:43,810
much yeah we have in the last one we

178
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:50,290
have supper area but this is the bond

179
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:54,910
hammer in your life so have these

180
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:57,160
hackers and these computers have also

181
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:07,629
built great protagonists of this

182
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:12,610
phenomena matrix and in the last example

183
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:21,220
perhaps is not the greatest film but but

184
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:25,629
it's still very popular hacker doesn't

185
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,060
make any sentiment connected to the

186
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:31,089
search of the origin of the hacker world

187
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,180
this is where it all begins

188
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:40,810
it all begins in the MIT this is a poem

189
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:43,479
written by a scientist of MIT in 1960

190
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:47,560
and why is there a train but at the time

191
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:52,060
the MIT was experimenting with a train

192
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,219
models and they they it were something

193
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,099
spectacular for the time but they were

194
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,339
missing some and components I want to

195
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:10,470
have a traffic light here or or a

196
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:10,470
junction that I need this part box

197
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:18,670
material that they needed and they not

198
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:22,060
use it for their model place and that's

199
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:24,459
what that's what that was a hack

200
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,640
when you were able to take something and

201
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:31,000
use it for something else than in turn

202
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:34,180
original in original indictment so Dobby

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,130
she was a hacker and there are all sorts

204
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,400
of hackers but what happened here this

205
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:43,720
is a murder this is a real picture of

206
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:46,810
MIT and what happened one day a nature

207
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,370
too many electrical business away from

208
00:13:46,810 --> 00:14:07,660
the telephone boxes and they left at all

209
00:13:50,370 --> 00:14:26,950
without phones electrical fuses from the

210
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:29,910
phone box this is the article printed at

211
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:40,150
the time explaining that this killed

212
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:44,420
broken of the of the hacker world as it

213
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:48,110
was originally and to try

214
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:53,449
to clean up the term we have invented

215
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:56,240
the term black hat hacker and white hat

216
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:59,120
hacker and that comes from the movies in

217
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,519
the western films the good guy always

218
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,470
dressed in white and they got the bad

219
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:09,889
guy always dressed in black and they

220
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:15,040
matching hats that's why we have these

221
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:17,660
white hub hackers and black hat hacker

222
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,540
although perhaps there's a better term

223
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,319
yes cracker would be a lot better it

224
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,399
says that my promoted and he said stop

225
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,699
calling

226
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:33,829
but guys let's choose another word

227
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:43,790
cracker it's been used a lot in the

228
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:46,250
ideas but it's so the question is if

229
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:49,730
this pejorative meaning of the word

230
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:54,790
started with this film because in Spain

231
00:15:49,730 --> 00:16:00,160
we have this habit of translating titles

232
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:04,250
it happened with the greatest spoiler of

233
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,819
raspberry baby baby which in Spanish was

234
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,940
translated into the seed of the devil

235
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:13,519
I'm sure you've heard about this feeling

236
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,740
1995 I have mixed feelings about this

237
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,350
but there are people living love it and

238
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,690
the technical people like it because it

239
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:25,779
it touches upon important topics but

240
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:36,410
look at that their crime is curiosity

241
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:41,089
and the second one is that in Spanish

242
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:43,730
they translated hackers computer pirates

243
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:47,240
and at the top it says you thought your

244
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:49,320
secrets were safe while you were wrong

245
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,360
so

246
00:16:49,320 --> 00:17:01,470
to see the film everything was spoiled

247
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:06,310
for you so what is a hacker so the film

248
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:19,050
has its charm because the main

249
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:23,589
characters be collecting IDs and writer

250
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:27,579
this prim writer just they are a lot of

251
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:30,429
people in the sector around but and

252
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:34,300
sometimes even wrote something that

253
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:38,040
actually made sense and there are two

254
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,040
books that you have to be familiar with

255
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:46,480
things but the static say history but it

256
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:54,000
is true that attack it talks about the

257
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:56,290
hacker culture which in the freak

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,120
element which has been part of the

259
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:03,399
culture ever since and the was quite

260
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:12,429
nice and it has been copied many times

261
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:14,140
have been in in mediums with beautiful

262
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,900
and Hawk the planet it's an interesting

263
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,300
concept yes and it identifies they they

264
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,630
save the planet sort of at play on those

265
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,629
words

266
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,960
there is one went forever because I was

267
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,970
a child of my first communion day I was

268
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,320
a suppressor and taken to see it I shall

269
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:41,170
feel very popular at the time wargames

270
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:47,939
1983 this film had a great impact in my

271
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:53,500
childhood because I wanted changed my

272
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:55,720
school scores with a computer I didn't

273
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:15,130
see the film but I was given the book

274
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:17,650
and from the I read it and the kid was

275
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:23,650
going to school and he would stay - in a

276
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:26,880
game being there you know that we spent

277
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:40,780
a lot of time in the game in arcades and

278
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:44,170
everything yes here is the time which

279
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,899
was were dialing you ring phone

280
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:49,270
Tennessee if a machine answers and then

281
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,390
if it was a machine you could use her

282
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:54,129
protocol of the time and and that was

283
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,700
something that was really off and it

284
00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:00,250
done yes that was done in United States

285
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:03,180
because you could you had a flat freight

286
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:06,850
and not in Spain you would have gone

287
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:09,160
bankrupt if you did that or so and here

288
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:15,070
the character or the computer to the

289
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:18,100
right has not monitor and the keyboard

290
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:20,770
and so but they

291
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,459
they just robbed us there being any

292
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:27,040
computer of the time that they lose

293
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,590
their person and they manipulated their

294
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,560
voice so what they did rather than

295
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:37,750
recording all of these entities they

296
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:40,659
would sort of scramble it in human voice

297
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,790
to make it sound machine like if there's

298
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,670
somebody who hasn't seen more games

299
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:50,680
everybody has seen it okay so you know

300
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:53,230
the genius with this a the film is also

301
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,020
based on this goes back like the first

302
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:59,790
ones today were a cold war this is the

303
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:03,250
second Cold War later on in the 80s and

304
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:05,830
here they introduced artificial

305
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,010
intelligence without noticing they are

306
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,929
talking about enhance the learner which

307
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,080
is a machine learning technique because

308
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:16,600
they were training the machine against

309
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,149
itself so that the machine should reach

310
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,240
a conclusion they didn't know but they

311
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:24,130
were actually starting from a base that

312
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,980
is now pinions which is enhanced

313
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,950
learning and a final metaphor which is

314
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:33,790
quite good the one over here the best

315
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:36,760
move is not to play because just

316
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:39,280
realized that with Cold War there was

317
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,230
going to be no winner whatsoever and the

318
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,250
dead cop this is the first time I saw

319
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:47,500
this term death come one two three four

320
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,630
that later on it became very popular

321
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,210
well this was probably the more the

322
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,280
flagship film of the eighties but it is

323
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,250
the dictator started again with the

324
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,260
comedy film a film that also showed

325
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,930
cybersecurity in a much more mature away

326
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,700
because one person just enter in the

327
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,310
system of somebody else trying to defend

328
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,790
this was teamwork very well organized

329
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:14,850
we're talking about these things they

330
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:17,820
sneakers are only 98 92 sorry

331
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:22,219
I like this more because it's it's

332
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,639
 yes it is a rat team no doubt

333
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,559
their works

334
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:27,750
these are different experts in Swiss

335
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:32,759
market whose electrode who is an expert

336
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:39,059
in in piracy and at the center is the

337
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:41,460
red team boss yeah that actor has to be

338
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:44,279
the boss here it's a penetration team

339
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:47,190
that panel testing and then their real

340
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:50,509
hacker the technician and a woman at the

341
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:59,250
top charge of the management of former

342
00:22:50,509 --> 00:23:02,129
FBI agent and and who did social

343
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:06,779
engineering and then there's some who's

344
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:09,689
based on this person the applied expert

345
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:13,799
Steve but for instance love him because

346
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:18,240
he got into the hockey area in security

347
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:21,269
and and it even founded April Apple with

348
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,120
Steve Jobs because they did this film

349
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:26,519
and when take care of the whole freaking

350
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,080
community of the time and Dave's they

351
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:33,149
said that this guy could actually

352
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:37,889
generate by blowing the right frequency

353
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:40,229
to reproduce the sound of the telephone

354
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:42,600
yeah it's a wild film the other tape and

355
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:46,169
we were preparing the tall guy I showed

356
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,719
the tried it no trailer to my 12 year

357
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,970
old son and he said when is this one

358
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,559
coming on but it's twenty years old and

359
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,320
you'd be surprised if you see it now

360
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,110
because of how contemporary it is and in

361
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,570
fact it closes with the quotation the

362
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,490
bad guy in the film who became famous

363
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,080
because of the Oscar that they receive

364
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,129
but then they stall better and worse

365
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,189
they replace the bad guy in Iron Man 3

366
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:14,090
shall bake a slave in place the bad guy

367
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:18,800
on this fear in the end

368
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:22,790
Thank You Slee supposed to go against

369
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:25,669
rather bad for a start and they started

370
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:27,710
feeling being a couple that are trying

371
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:32,150
to steal money from the banks to pivot

372
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:33,740
to charities and this film what they

373
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,560
have a box that have a reference a

374
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:39,380
stolen and they wanted to use to bad

375
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,590
stock and it's a box that allows you

376
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:45,110
with cryptography to have access to all

377
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,550
code and then kiss me tell him that

378
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,280
scheme is not this is not just about

379
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:51,680
money this is not just about power but

380
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,780
what it says here the world isn't round

381
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,360
by weapons anymore or energy or money

382
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:58,610
but it's run by little ones and zeros

383
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,229
little bit of data it's just electrons

384
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,360
it's about who controls the information

385
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,970
what we see and hear how we work what we

386
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:09,620
think it's all about the information and

387
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:18,760
this is 1992 and we're still there and

388
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:18,760
the fear was also supported by experts

389
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:29,120
he was one of the advisors of the field

390
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:32,300
so it has a sort of a very solid

391
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,850
scientific based basis and as to the

392
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:38,540
Machine it was able to decipher any

393
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:41,389
cryptographic code here I am that

394
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,240
suggests to me quantum cryptography

395
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:48,470
yes but the pocket quantum cryptography

396
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:54,140
a great film anyway but of being a bit

397
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:56,510
of kind of cheated here in the first the

398
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:01,820
x-files film for a few minutes you get a

399
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:05,180
team what these guys the longer legs

400
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:07,850
guys like teamwork sneakers are

401
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,169
appearing on The X Files

402
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,879
and there's a series they're not my

403
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:12,559
people have seen he's in a speech I say

404
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,100
it's been off from the x-files I'm going

405
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:19,580
to save you telecoms expert social

406
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:22,100
engineering expert and then the idea is

407
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,668
just amazing is really it really is

408
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,740
amazing

409
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:29,539
so technically do read of the real

410
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:38,780
things so let us go back to the hackers

411
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:58,340
movies here we have another one between

412
00:26:38,780 --> 00:27:01,399
TV option suppose we call this picture

413
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:05,330
you see one of them is working the other

414
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,190
one I was working of course the real

415
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:10,000
Apple genius he was one doing the work

416
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:14,809
to see if Jobs was looking at things

417
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,669
but why pirate first of all pirates

418
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:18,590
sorry can remain that off because they

419
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,350
didn't have any geographic environment

420
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:24,649
apple or Windows they install it to

421
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:29,480
Zurich Palmer who operated one day Steve

422
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:32,240
Jobs Bill Gates got ahead in publishing

423
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,280
Windows 1.0 okay so what happened very

424
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,230
angry he called him up and said hey

425
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,760
don't you so from now know Bill Gates

426
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,760
was the only person

427
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:45,779
has been proven between a name Stanley

428
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:50,010
Steve Jobs said hey I haven't done

429
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:53,789
anything I say I know when to steal from

430
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:57,809
a neighbor and I saw you are you won't

431
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:59,129
just leave it before and he said it's

432
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,678
not probably not in that way without

433
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:05,929
conversation it exists so when you look

434
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,929
at things you did happen Steve Jobs

435
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,960
imperative about theft then on the other

436
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:16,440
hand it was quite common Silicon Valley

437
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,000
you have a pirate flag in teams who is

438
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,130
something innovative affect my sick jobs

439
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,000
done we need to be smart or maybe have a

440
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:28,529
permit flood and here we have pictures

441
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,539
from the film when this picture is part

442
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:35,549
you know sting and you're saying yeah so

443
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:36,840
Steve's looks great today yes so it's

444
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:38,490
our security there's a level of

445
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,129
awareness three two one

446
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,049
it is a funny thing how many bows for

447
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:48,320
the Raptors not you know a cyber

448
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:48,320
security needs to pertain to everyone

449
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:58,019
especially hackers is ability to admit

450
00:28:55,110 --> 00:29:00,629
point that is right it's hard for same

451
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:06,510
time to make it well sometimes we

452
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:09,419
advanced is worthless if you and enough

453
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,960
put this here underneath of Apple

454
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,960
foundation

455
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,649
Steve what look so that he hadn't done

456
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:26,820
anything because Irish that was just

457
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:26,820
warehouse well he's doing easier based

458
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:41,499
remember joy bubble who was in front of

459
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:47,469
cereal box and inside there was a

460
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:52,929
whistle that little joy bubble did 600

461
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:56,229
heads and they bond to make three calls

462
00:29:52,929 --> 00:30:01,149
use them at university but they never

463
00:29:56,229 --> 00:30:07,599
really sold them maybe some expertise

464
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:13,299
working my kids they begun with this and

465
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:40,708
we'll get his machine he was trying to

466
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:40,709
make a call with Tommy and Hughes

467
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,110
see also stoner free Chima that he

468
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:02,240
fought near deal but he got paid with

469
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:04,580
little food and I'm not taking the

470
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,030
Marriott offer Steve Jobs he had the

471
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:13,250
world of business great vision and he

472
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:17,810
knew how but he does talk about I love

473
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,920
hate relationship of safe gates of Bill

474
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:34,460
Gates and Steve Jobs

475
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:37,520
well Microsoft towards the owner of

476
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:41,300
nearly all of our people who are whether

477
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:43,970
you not see Bill Gates that was cremated

478
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:47,180
lunch and then job said let's see my new

479
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:52,520
partner and Bill Gates appeared and

480
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:54,520
people were moving because he had always

481
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,610
been Chris a simple guys but he

482
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:01,290
eventually won

483
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:15,629
we'll help those there's a whole

484
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:18,000
long-standing relationship between its

485
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:25,290
called transpiration

486
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:29,179
is really scary remember the Publix is

487
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:37,309
not just like in here all executive

488
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:40,710
doing commerce on signal Valley however

489
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:54,090
behind he is sitting software for

490
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:57,720
programmers and masking really Phillips

491
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:59,490
are and if t realize is that different

492
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,919
people are dying strong circumstances

493
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,919
yes is lost a set of circumstances like

494
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:13,650
there's some interesting concept is by

495
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:20,809
some McCarthy that the founder of it's

496
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:20,809
obvious that I wasn't with those two

497
00:33:27,490 --> 00:34:10,699
so she virus security and through a

498
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,679
front she discovers one of the software

499
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:16,759
problems of the government of the USA

500
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:24,530
he's using has bugged all the pretty

501
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:27,139
much everything : way to say the same

502
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,030
thing he'll office absent a fire sale

503
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:36,290
so she's guilty number disappears she

504
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:39,200
knows her circular but the e key part

505
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:41,679
the in part of a she finds a virus

506
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,678
greater

507
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:53,740
this is a king of the world

508
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,030
now the management machines

509
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,020
talks about

510
00:37:39,130 --> 00:38:17,270
he's just good because there are some

511
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:21,640
mistakes such as they own a machine

512
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:23,810
human manufactured he was picture here

513
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,250
manufacturing hitting a gallery junkies

514
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:29,359
song but it was a undermining the

515
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:31,940
chronic machine he didn't yourself when

516
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,670
a machine even managed to automate this

517
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,580
de touhina process you see the

518
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:39,530
university barber is just inverse

519
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:43,310
engineering trillion remember he was

520
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:54,640
opposed then all of a mansion here so me

521
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:54,640
too well

522
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:17,940
you probably expect I hated this we have

523
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:21,650
one ship of the virus and once I saw the

524
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:32,840
extended version expand it to make sense

525
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:32,840
right in lucky 150 there was a spaceship

526
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,260
15 years these have been

527
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:59,280
I stopped in the food network computers

528
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:03,500
so the phase which is beginning Facebook

529
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:06,800
so Lincoln very active database nation

530
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:11,090
yes it kind of expands out can you see

531
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,090
there's a realistic full of cinema

532
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,679
[Music]

533
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,910
for my ears she's like this

534
00:45:13,150 --> 00:46:00,290
well he made me say to American systems

535
00:45:53,090 --> 00:46:13,210
selling information so you are some o2

536
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:13,210
others but do something with each animal

537
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,919
[Music]

538
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,080
consciousness

539
00:47:47,540 --> 00:48:12,800
when I'm 15 again too much fish might

540
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:18,430
face what it is was a secret it was a

541
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,430
code it's not reality

542
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:31,240
there's another thing here like a Seco

543
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:49,550
18,000 monitors with possible just

544
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:55,330
mechanisms trace of a gimmick you teach

545
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:55,330
English for a hunter I don't think

546
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:02,990
how are you doing

547
00:51:03,489 --> 00:51:16,059
there's actually

548
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:47,299
so KP 1 you saying

549
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:27,710
but there needs to be something

550
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:39,429
ok so let's give the hospital rules

551
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:39,429
[Music]

552
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,560
okay

553
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:08,308
can you since we don't like security

554
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,309
firms in Spain

555
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:21,840
fix wasn't too much does anyone have one

556
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:23,819
question for the speakers I think I said

557
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,580
when we go to detail where they should

558
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:28,950
be really short and quick by the way

559
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:34,160
well you might not like it but here miss

560
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:37,710

561
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,770
made with a snail do you have any

564
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,390
windows a little suggestion yes we're

565
