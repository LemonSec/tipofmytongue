1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:07,660
you have the floor well good afternoon

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:09,730
everybody thanks to the organization for

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,299
giving us this opportunity and pushing

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:16,810
the Spanish startups so what you already

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:20,110
know what usually happens with all the

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:25,330
security security departments we are

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:27,730
always overwhelmed I become I belong to

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,130
the sisters department and we are always

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,420
doing many different things and we try

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,970
that everything's as safe as possible

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:40,690
but it is not easy especially when we

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:45,339
have to make a lot of deployments etc so

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:48,370
we have words that are exposing any type

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:52,870
of thing we have not been mischievous

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:56,470
but they end up by spoiling our safety

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:59,320
and our things so mr. rooters trying to

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,000
solve these type of things we try to see

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,360
what we have on the internet what type

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,250
of assets you have what ports and what

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,979
things are affecting you to solve it as

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,500
soon as possible because every

22
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,020
additional minute could mean a pollutant

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,479
a lot of millions of euros or dollars or

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,240
whatever and with these course we are

25
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,530
giving just an information score and

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,750
that's it

27
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:27,760
so it's just to tell you what level you

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,330
have within that score and how do you

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,060
work this is our high our top level top

30
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:37,119
level infrastructure we have a cell

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,610
provisioning system we just need a

32
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,860
domain in that way we can say what do

33
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,630
you have the Internet so mr. lucre as

34
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,880
every organization no matter its being

35
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,220
small etc is as simple as that we didn't

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,100
have to start installing things that you

37
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,350
start having IP ranges etc so this

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,710
information is taken by us so this is

39
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:59,770
analyzed through real time and in a

40
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,369
periodic way when we introduce it and on

41
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:06,880
a periodic way daily weekly whatever and

42
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,579
we inform the involve parties through a

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,760
website email etc so that the action is

44
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:15,909
as quick as possible so I think or

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,530
you try it now it's open we've launched

46
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:20,709
the version number well the first

47
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,599
version 15 one month ago 15,000 one

48
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,569
month ago we can register your own

49
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,890
company your own domain and you have to

50
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,839
register the domain that you want to

51
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,899
register so that we know that it belongs

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,110
to you and to others and what is

53
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,760
trending now are the cloud environments

54
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,099
what happens with these environments we

55
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,970
resume machines and seconds

56
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:45,040
databases are developers raised

57
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,680
databases machines etc we have much more

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,950
flexibility but we also have many more

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,170
problems so it would be great that we

60
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,030
could say well we're as a machine we

61
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,679
know about it and if there's any

62
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,329
vulnerability we can react against that

63
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,280
in minutes this is way where we are - we

64
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:09,030
have a solution with a three main cloud

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,030
providers Amazon Azul and Google we're

66
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:15,040
just installing Miss lucre with some

67
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,959
configuration and setups we were able to

68
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,388
scan that in real time this is not just

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,090
I mean we were walking the talk we have

70
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:28,299
we have a real we have a real test I

71
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,040
can't say the name with a bank but what

72
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:32,379
we have in this case has an

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,440
infrastructure in Amazon and what we

74
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:37,540
have is a lambda I don't know if you

75
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,169
know a lambda where lambda is well it's

76
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,340
a function that is executed on the

77
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,370
specific environment so we have

78
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,370
developed a lambda in Amazon that with a

79
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:52,829
couple of clicks can be installed and

80
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:55,720
it's moisturing the your cloud provider

81
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,650
infrastructure and in that moment each

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,650
communicates

83
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,059
through with our environment through an

84
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,069
API on real-time it informs a customer

85
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,830
through we're home

86
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:12,980
to close reports to throw the Machine

87
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,470
away whatever but to do it as fast as

88
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,769
possible so I wanted to show you a demo

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:22,400
so that you can see how it works well

90
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:25,870
here you can see the lambda in the

91
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,169
marketplace Oh No

92
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:32,480
yes that's it well after installing it

93
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,760
after clicking on installation it's just

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,490
one click to install it another one to

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:42,950
give new permissions and the sense that

96
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:46,270
we want you to to install it etc and

97
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,440
this is going to deploy this function

98
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,510
everywhere we want it in this case I

99
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,830
think it's in California in Virginia and

100
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:56,599
it will be deployed and we'll be

101
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,890
monitoring everything we do it's we will

102
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,860
be checking whether there are new

103
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,180
machines no I mean it will be the other

104
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,040
way around every time that there is a

105
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,300
machine new machine created we will know

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,770
that it's going to be executed this is a

107
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,140
configuration that we have Kim mr. Luger

108
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,919
this would be our app we have to create

109
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,659
a token JWT so that this mom that can

110
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,229
connect to our infrastructure and that's

111
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,660
it as simple as that now we are copying

112
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:23,719
and now we're going to show you the part

113
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,900
that has to do with work hooks if we

114
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,419
want to call to launch wahoo what we're

115
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,179
doing here or what we could do here is

116
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:34,609
to configure our URL where we the room

117
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,080
is so lookit to attack to say well I

118
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,380
found this ports these vulnerabilities

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,650
on this asset so this way you'll be able

120
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,140
to act if you were to close ports you

121
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,810
send an email whatever so now we're

122
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,310
going to configure this token in lambda

123
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,260
is the only thing that I have to

124
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,240
configure in lambda for everything to

125
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,940
work and that's it but this will have a

126
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,979
missile occur in our infrastructure and

127
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,710
this is a real there's a real little

128
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:02,090
test well it's a video I mean we're

129
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,650
we're creating a machine I'm get to

130
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,500
create a machine with an boner bulimia

131
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,219
ami I've just raised the database and an

132
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,619
index where I'm going to expose the poor

133
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:16,610
5432 and

134
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:18,499
8080 port and this should tell us well

135
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:22,519
you have two ports open there's a

136
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:25,789
database an open database so here we are

137
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:28,309
opening the Amazon proxy we just

138
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:29,389
launched it we give the permissions

139
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,769
everything we have to do if you are

140
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,869
accustomed to to do this type of thing

141
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:35,269
screen machines all the steps that you

142
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:37,669
that Amazon requires and we launched it

143
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:40,219
this is what every developer would do

144
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,409
every develop the race racism machine we

145
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:44,149
do we're not machines but they opened

146
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:46,629
the ports because they need to continue

147
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:50,959
to log in from their computer from their

148
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:54,919
local position so what happens in Miss

149
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,829
lucre let's see if it I am up the

150
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,058
creation so mr. Luger knows that there

151
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:00,559
has been any creation there's a no

152
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:04,159
there's a note that says there is a new

153
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:06,769
IP in your infrastructures so it is

154
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:10,759
scanned then everything's stacked so

155
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:12,889
that you are able to know who's that IP

156
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,569
is because we won't know all the

157
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,479
information to them and with an IP and

158
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:19,550
after that we saw to give new to be to

159
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,409
receive vulnerabilities not pools here

160
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,389
we can see all the information both of

161
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,949
the the poor the banner that we can see

162
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,709
etcetera and the vulnerabilities that we

163
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:32,269
have linked to every port these are

164
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:33,829
under a critical level critical hello hi

165
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:35,449
whatever cotton depending on the

166
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,639
