of the day very closed lunchtime and my

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,308
presentation is aimed at sharing with us

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:37,219
healthy which I often see especially

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:43,468
when I talk to HR people had hunters and

13
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:47,250
what I see in the market both from the

14
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:51,390
IE and from our education institution

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,840
where we have two security programs and

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:59,100
courses when the Job Description for

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,250
security expertise produced oftentimes

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,710
we see that those who produce or create

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,400
the profile or describe that profile

20
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:12,509
have no know nothing about cybersecurity

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:17,400
those of us who work in cybersecurity we

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,920
will have a safe job for the next 20

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,530
years so we would retire some security

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,850
experts those of you who are younger

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,729
will also have lots and lots of work we

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,780
have a match focused on kuwaiti but what

27
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:37,470
come to us as a result of TG that

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,900
Reformation ruled in innovation factors

29
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,798
is just impressive

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,560
according to LinkedIn well actually if

31
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,680
you type in security you will find out

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,200
the high number of vacancies that are

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,130
open even in the Spanish market that has

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,909
been in big extensions up until now we

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,689
are starting to see personnel turnover

36
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:08,009
for people switching companies often

37
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:11,609
with an interest and now well which are

38
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:14,179
the most wanted profiles there are very

39
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,180
many of them

40
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,518
so some of our masters courses students

41
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,530
had people from international

42
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,750
relationship from the law school people

43
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,870
who have never seen a code of line in

44
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,629
their life yet they are following our

45
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,610
muscle school in cybersecurity we will

46
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,640
be needing hackers we will be needing

47
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:40,170
technical experts we will be needing

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,958
managers legal experts by the time cyber

49
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,420
attacks will be actually materialized we

50
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,930
will be needing team leaders people

51
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,018
managing budgets budgets will be greater

52
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,349
and greater we need people who will

53
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,780
explain to Jose who don't know anything

54
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:01,220
what will happen if we do not take

55
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:06,030
action I talk about digital jungle

56
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,549
digital transformation no security the

57
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:14,190
digital security is implemented all that

58
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:19,799
become care data are overwhelming 4

59
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:26,130
million is the vaulty number for 2020

60
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:29,940
1/4 million the business school 4

61
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:33,480
thousand people are here so quite a few

62
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,180
centuries to cover the market needs for

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,720
human resources so we have to bring in

64
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,010
talent from the vocational schools

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,510
because many of you haven't studied a

66
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,510
university career or are considering it

67
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,668
either you don't need to need it all you

68
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:59,459
need is to have enthusiasm and

69
00:03:50,669 --> 00:04:05,609
imagination and creativity we talk about

70
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:09,870
the most attractive position you just

71
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:12,510
ask what you want it's free first many

72
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,910
times these profiles do not exist and if

73
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,209
they do they are in high demand or there

74
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,608
may be be polar or psychotics or

75
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,620
Psychopaths but if have to know

76
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:26,159
absolutely about every

77
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:30,419
so people look for profiles that models

78
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:33,479
have to be has to have hard skills as

79
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:39,258
well as soft skills so there has to be

80
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:45,719
someone who has superpowers laser vision

81
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:47,219
hyper strength hyper intelligence so you

82
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:50,520
can ask for it when I saw the job

83
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:55,020
descriptions the soft skills is

84
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,690
overwhelming 24 27 year old guy who

85
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,969
knows how to manage teens with

86
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:07,650
leadership capacity charisma but a

87
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:12,360
conflict resolution so if then I go to

88
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:14,250
the hard skills a whole long list in

89
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,279
addition to that they have to control

90
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:23,669
emerging technologies tech venker

91
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:28,430
vectors AI robotics drones car attacks

92
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:31,849
hey how much I'm gonna pay this guy

93
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:36,840
because in the end if they say well a

94
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:41,400
hundred and fifty to a hundred a few

95
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:47,279
zeros to that actually you say you're

96
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,020

[Music]

101
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,539
calories are in a celery stick six

102
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:30,620
calories Clara celery is excellent for

103
00:06:20,539 --> 00:07:01,810
your health your vitamins your training

104
00:06:30,620 --> 00:07:04,639
session Eliza way no school stop below

105
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:09,199
okay did you like videos happy looks do

106
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:12,919
you know what pillow is it appeared in

107
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:17,210
the markets and then then it was gone

108
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:21,590
you know why raise your hand if you know

109
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:27,710
how many cybersecurity people worked in

110
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:30,909
this project come on give us a cool 20

111
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:35,090
okay you got a cookie as a reward so

112
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:38,180
zero cyber security people so pinata we

113
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,940
were able to capture this video just

114
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,479
before it was taken offline

115
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:48,349
it's a venture capitalist idea is

116
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:50,630
amazing it's a great idea you have a

117
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:53,060
person robot that gives you your

118
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,870
medication it advises you on your health

119
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,750
it knows what are your problems your

120
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,720
health problems

121
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,670
number of your relatives to medical

122
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,780
alerts or disinformation correct my

123
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:10,220
pillows and interacts in the physical

124
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,169
space because pillow supplies pill

125
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,300
pillow that's why it's called pillow so

126
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,460
imagine one of the freakiest here what

127
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,700
can you do that when you know the pillow

128
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,890
connects to Wi-Fi its exchange

129
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,260
information with the cloud of the

130
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,229
company of a pillow cloud right that

131
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:32,840
there's no one in the company who assess

132
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,840
the risks what can you do with pillow

133
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,150
another thing what can you spin well

134
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:43,409
just thinking about the business plan

135
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:47,189
that were great to sell 40 20 million

136
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:51,439
pillows so 42 million families in the US

137
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:55,550
with a pillow on the kitchen table

138
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,870
imagine what Chinese Russians could do

139
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,260
any government that had control of

140
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:04,290
pillow and said hey I did that's all I

141
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,350
need I've got pillow under control these

142
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,240
guys tomorrow will be I mean they won't

143
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:15,560
even get outta bed I will supply them

144
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:18,780
with an Aldi or I came the wrong advice

145
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,020
malicious intelligence artificial

146
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:26,640
malicious intelligence

147
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:30,480
so we're highly focused on the core T in

148
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:34,350
seeing where's the VPN calculation

149
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:39,540
center but this isn't the future our

150
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:42,420
homes will be filled with these things

151
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,930
that rumbas there are these automatic

152
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,479
vacuum cleaners or one of the best most

153
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:52,829
popular gifts they have the cameras

154
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,480
cameras microphones speakers so they

155
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,570
collect a lot of information with these

156
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,050
robots you can kill people actually so

157
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,550
pillow just no longer on the market it's

158
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,670
you can't ride anymore

159
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,530
but it doesn't come on its own we will

160
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,310
have a lot of things coming behind it so

161
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,420
when I think

162
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:14,250
what do we look for in what is the

163
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:18,209
profile of someone to work in the future

164
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,970
in cybersecurity little boat you see

165
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:27,839
there it's a Norwegian project that has

166
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:37,529
over 100 metre long bow ties without a

167
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:39,960
human being on board it is going to put

168
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:42,900
it into production after a pilot phase I

169
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:46,320
hope they have learned from pillows and

170
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,900
put someone in the project checking

171
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,210
about the risks or shall be have another

172
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,209
pillow but in a ship 100 meter long ship

173
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:58,279
imagine what can be done with it or was

174
00:10:54,210 --> 00:11:01,920
that da Vinci approach the robotized

175
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:04,439
operates in theatre houses our homes

176
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,689
will be full of robots so we have to be

177
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,460
able to warn raise alerts create new

178
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:16,700
auditor environments new control

179
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:21,360
environments new monitor many styles

180
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:24,210
types of malware focused on controlling

181
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,960
this on the digital devices are you

182
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:32,089
ready because he as we will have even

183
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,740
more jobs if we need four million jobs

184
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:40,170
with for IT imagine with the pillows

185
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:42,600
that will turn up so what I'm missing

186
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,500
when I to take a look at these job

187
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,620
descriptions are things like what those

188
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,790
who work is number two or level

189
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,500
three over shock can understand don't

190
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,380
turn talk to me about the leadership

191
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,670
team management when you work in a shock

192
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,460
the first thing that you need is this

193
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,430
confidentiality we'll methods manage

194
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,920
sensitive information resistance to

195
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:13,689
stress if in crisis management

196
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:17,439
cold-blood one a cries man the

197
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:20,360
confidence commitment you were not

198
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,170
someone who develop colds in an IT

199
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,380
department that go he just turn off the

200
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,240
computer and go back home at five this

201
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,730
is different you work on incidents and

202
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,330
these can occur anytime and you've gotta

203
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:40,750
be available in addition the most

204
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,750
involved nothing is creativity intuition

205
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,199
pillows oh my god what these guys are

206
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:51,320
gonna put in the market for $600 then

207
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,110
these realize and it said hey have any

208
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,170
certification any control no but it's

209
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,140
safe there's nay not even a regulation

210
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:06,829
to require anything a pillow no laws to

211
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:10,390
certify these devices perseverance

212
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,390
another characteristic

213
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:19,140
well we really have nanorobots to take

214
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,870
care of our children the latest data of

215
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:26,040
the RSA they have 70,000 companies world

216
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,720
while developing IOT ot ever in science

217
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,790
between fifteen and twenty seven and

218
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,800
please raise your hand if you know how

219
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,959
many interpreters community and

220
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,219
cybersecurity works in these 70,000

221
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:44,339
companies you another another cookie for

222
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:47,220
you zero amazing the world that is

223
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:53,640
coming it will become a jungle if we

224
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:56,850
don't start to work so I think it's

225
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,250
great that you're focused on karate but

226
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,800
this is the future it's the the old

227
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,870
digital environment that is coming on us

228
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,719
and we will need many code analysts

229
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:13,050
testing ability sessemann audits

230
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:18,990
everything you can think of because

231
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:21,390
losing information with a ransom of lost

232
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:25,740
all the pictures of the birthday of your

233
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:28,319
son the appointment for the dentist but

234
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,720
imagine if you can manipulate all the

235
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,350
robots we've seen before that interact

236
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:44,089
in our life so what is the risk like

237
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:49,890
with a pillow how I perceived many

238
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:51,120
fronts this is from a book the work in

239
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,240
cybersecurity

240
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,500
it's called that inspired me for this

241
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,470
presentation which is what what we have

242
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:05,640
to develop as actual capabilities not so

243
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:09,450
much leadership but this been lawyers

244
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:12,520
for our cybersecurity advocates product

245
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:16,610
managers researchers

246
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:20,060
investors we will need people who can

247
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:29,480
send cyber security and defended in all

248
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:34,910
forums connect empathically with the

249
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:38,840
board of directors companies last year

250
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:42,949
the SEC or release the security

251
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:46,010
guidelines football for boards so are

252
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:49,580
you ready to go to a board and turn them

253
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,620
one of the risks and then where they

254
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,800
have to invest their money we have to do

255
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,800
this

256
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:04,690
pre-med leave it'll cure a community his

257
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:06,700
first book I recommend this is a bishop

258
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,650
partners that the that next year to

259
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,020
politics the future of world air force

260
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:15,340
the way in which technology will change

261
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:18,250
geopolitics and the same basis of on the

262
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:25,930
core of democracy with hybrid threats

263
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:28,740
and fake news sure at least some started

264
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,949
to collect information and large it and

265
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:34,330
obtain genuine risk scenarios on the

266
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,440
basis of what we know and this is

267
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:46,360
overwhelming us imagine terrorism with

268
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:50,490
pillows and monix drones on the second

269
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:55,450
book yeah for you to take the picture

270
00:16:50,490 --> 00:17:00,910
the second book working in cybersecurity

271
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:06,580
the various phases of our world it is

272
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:10,379
not about cold cold in only but we also

273
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:14,609
have to interpret harms of the business

274
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,610
will be impacted

275
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:29,220
to know how to develop things like

276
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:32,658
rooted to exchange information how to go

277
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:39,090
beyond how could how to go out there and

278
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:40,799
tell a story to people who don't know

279
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,668
this if they're gonna buy pillows okay

280
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,190
great

281
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:48,600
people are buying room baths every day

282
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:50,549
to clean the floors with the author you

283
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,399
can use some types of where what is to

284
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:55,620
reveal where you are at your location

285
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:56,549
and this is part of our job to raise

286
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,500
awareness

287
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:05,700
I love the chant University said I want

288
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,340
to see technocrats experts in

289
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,820
cybersecurity involved in politics

290
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:16,289
otherwise we will get into trouble so

291
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:19,559
any questions I told the man that I'll

292
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:27,299
be short and straight and to get a

293
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:29,668
debate going I I love The Avengers we

294
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:31,830
would rather be identified as electronic

295
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:34,159
mechanics I believe is it so thank you

296
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,158
very much

297
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:45,690
saying thank you look at any questions

298
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,690
remember you have to use the microphones

299
00:18:46,679 --> 00:19:03,160
question politician techies and

300
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:08,080
conventional tech their techies you have

301
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:16,559
to displace the old guard well at one

302
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:16,559
point they have to retire so nature

303
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:25,059
works it's cause there's a generation of

304
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,720
techies there is a pushing and making

305
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,950
headway

306
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,190
Bruce Mayer has become a politician in

307
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:36,669
few years he is dedicating half this

308
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,520
time talking about the risk if techies

309
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:41,020
do not get involved in civil society and

310
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,790
they start talking about these things

311
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:49,179
outside of theirs usual circles what

312
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:54,178
they can attract in these forums and I

313
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:54,179
think that the pillow is the best friend

314
00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:02,320
we also have to do our homework I agree

315
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:06,899
and that there many people in the US but

316
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:11,710
also in Spain having a million

317
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:14,320
technology so stop making so much money

318
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:18,360
and start getting involved with your

319
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,439
society around you there was an

320
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,409
interview to the vice president of Chile

321
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,230
that he said something that was really

322
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:31,200
amazing for an elderly person he said

323
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:35,460
that democracy is the result of the

324
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,990
printing machine he said that if the

325
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,610
printing machine is the result of

326
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,420
democracy what will happen with the

327
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,540
Internet

328
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:47,280
well I see it as quite bleak democracy

329
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:50,399
right now is endangered by the hybrid

330
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,260
threats that come in upon us and we're

331
00:20:50,400 --> 00:21:00,810
getting there late and I can tell you

332
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:04,710
stop burning millions and starts telling

333
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,750
us what we have to do and for what we

334
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:11,790
