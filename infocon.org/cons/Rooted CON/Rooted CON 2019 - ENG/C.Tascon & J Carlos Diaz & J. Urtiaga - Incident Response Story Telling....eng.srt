1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:09,239
come on we're okay thank you very much

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,410
for staying here in the room for this

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,490
presentation like to think the

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:18,029
organization of rooted for us it's a

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:23,160
pleasure to be here and to see how the

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:25,830
community is growing we went from being

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:32,610
just a handful of people to be such a

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:37,949
huge crowd we will use a storytelling

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:41,700
format to describe a very high impact

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:47,879
event as a complex story so we will

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:50,340
distribute the rolls and the blue guy as

12
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,430
you can see my t-shirt with his collar

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,399
in charge of the defense and detection

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:03,449
and reaction at the event against the

15
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:19,890
event and each one has but not here but

16
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:22,310
also there and so as my Connor says I'm

17
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,580
in charge of carrying out the attack

18
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:36,570
with strategy to counteract the defense

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:38,880
strategy try to show you my video to

20
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,279
give you an idea of the situation that

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,880
gave rise to the call we received from

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,880
this company

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:57,350
oh you just plug in the jack

24
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,490
hello can you hear me

25
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,470
give me yes can you mean strange with

26
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:40,980
the distortions but enough to understand

27
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:44,250
it safely any communications amateurs so

28
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,660
I take some precautions prefer to avoid

29
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,660
being tracked this one is typically

30
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:55,290
looks good did you follow my instruction

31
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,810
yeah strictly but I'm a bit worried as I

32
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,359
have been afraid to get in particular

33
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,940
stores don't worry for fun of us our

34
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,459
indications you won't get any problem

35
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,959
and you will get what you want these

36
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:11,790
disabilities did you get access to the

37
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:16,769
service I'm trying but it's difficult to

38
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,989
do it without noticing from everything

39
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,019
is privately canceled until a the date

40
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:26,130
we have an order and we never fail our

41
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:28,590
plan has to be fulfilled to the mind to

42
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,769
the smallest details I won't have any

43
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,610
impact okay this week I will focus on

44
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:38,579
this download there were clear data

45
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,709
submitters I sent you and run it on the

46
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:42,720
server I'm sure this one was I don't

47
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,600
want to end up on the street or in

48
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,910
person we've been years carrying out

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,130
these operations throughout the world we

50
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,489
go in all together and we live together

51
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,859
we never say I will never betray our

52
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:59,630
other clients installed

53
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,630
rootkit and we do the rest

54
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,920
behaves naturally the worst ignore any

55
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:08,379
news remain here and everything will be

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,450
fine it's the only way to reach our

57
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,440
objective this type in the movie of

58
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,780
course I've already asked how many

59
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:20,440
things depend on this event the people

60
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:33,090
could die this would be finished and if

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:33,090
I need necessary when this is over again

62
00:04:53,190 --> 00:05:21,210
because in the

63
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,970
[Music]

64
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,629
[Music]

65
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,840
just crazy company SSL internal context

66
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:21,270
from the clients in panic mode in a

67
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:21,270
situation of to place this in context

68
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:42,250
what does a high impact private a

69
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:45,520
multitude of due to the transformation

70
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:49,240
process supported by technological

71
00:07:45,520 --> 00:08:00,810
assets any disruption would generate a

72
00:07:49,240 --> 00:08:00,810
very high reputation of

73
00:08:17,150 --> 00:09:08,640
so this at stake involving huge amounts

74
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:10,199
of money vector is disruption okay so it

75
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
is clear there's an organized group

76
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:14,490
organized crime group from another

77
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:30,750
company in that they have some proof

78
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:39,510
country and they have an inside so we

79
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:42,930
have to be very the primary and

80
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:54,079
secondary should be as a transport and

81
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:57,079
then the sophistication of the approach

82
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:57,079
break

83
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:05,970
acid that will give entry to the

84
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,970
secretary which is the organized crime

85
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:21,430
vamos a terminar we we will determine

86
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:27,910
the risk to understand where we have to

87
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:32,500
focus frequency master facing here is

88
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:35,079
quite safe actually that the tax will

89
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:40,150
take place so the probability of action

90
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:44,920
we know it is intended intentional here

91
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:47,170
we have some counterintelligence we are

92
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:55,150
not against the attacker we can

93
00:10:47,170 --> 00:11:05,260
influence the background a lot of money

94
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:21,400
at stake for the attack difficulty and

95
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:32,620
protection side to minimize the impact

96
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:40,209
and related to the resistance of the

97
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:42,900
organization against the event thank

98
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:42,900
again I am sorry

99
00:11:57,149 --> 00:13:35,970
because they have a degree in the

100
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,970
blackout mechanisms to be activated

101
00:13:39,690 --> 00:14:01,220
it's fundamental method the first thing

102
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,220
is to orchestrate everything to capacity

103
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,810
final part in which we take control and

104
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:29,430
establish all the mechanisms to recover

105
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:34,680
control different impact reputation or

106
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:48,390
economic in this defensive attraction in

107
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:53,099
line with the committee's bodies and

108
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:56,670
here the all wrench has to be conveyed

109
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:00,590
or to report the news in the most

110
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:04,319
diligent so how would we coordinate

111
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:10,860
orchestrate on this basically do a

112
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:12,530
deployment in three million area the

113
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:17,340
first part is to evaluate the

114
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:19,290
consequences and focus we know we could

115
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:23,450
be successful that is diminish in the

116
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,449
impact to sway to the attacker

117
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,630
there are two establish mechanisms of

118
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:33,030
relationship that feels teams that will

119
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:37,560
be doing the investigations as well as

120
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:41,750
the defense so we will review the entire

121
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:46,800
parameter of businesses of this company

122
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:48,210
to identify any entrance vector and then

123
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,300
we will class

124
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:56,200
most critical in-house platforms to

125
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,750
verify their level of security we will

126
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,660
implement intelligence capacities we

127
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:06,390
monitored by different sources to find

128
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,390
out whether the event the or the attack

129
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:15,970
can be identified through the internet

130
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:18,460
so in the blue part what we have is the

131
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,880
most conventional part of incidence

132
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:26,530
response so we classified the various

133
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:29,620
assets based on the information sent by

134
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:34,720
our red partner resolve vulnerabilities

135
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:38,610
to diminish that exposure an increase at

136
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:45,240
least the difficulty of the attack and

137
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:51,220
see in which way we can limit vulnerable

138
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:54,850
data increase the barriers and identify

139
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:57,310
if something is occurring inside the

140
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,740
organization - as well as developing a

141
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:06,069
plan B in case they can actually damage

142
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:12,569
the organization we will through

143
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:14,980
committees each one for change will wait

144
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:19,958
strategic part and decision-making and

145
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:23,890
reporting mechanism the hand and the

146
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,350
talk management company and we have to

147
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:32,040
give them all the information for taking

148
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:32,040
these decisions must be representative

149
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,129
but with a greater weight of the orange

150
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:46,540
operation of crisis committee

151
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:49,809
trustworthy people to define the actions

152
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,520
of each business area

153
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:56,418
answer we'll consider the legal

154
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,610
implications and finally operational

155
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:00,289
follow-up committee this is crucial

156
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,979
because it has to be to be deployed at

157
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:06,770
first day while the red and blue teams

158
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,350
are obtaining information extensively as

159
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:16,639
possible so right from the start we can

160
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:24,230
actually substantiate and deliver all

161
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:26,450
the abilities we talked about now we

162
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,760
have the face of deploying the

163
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:32,510
capabilities from the blue viewpoint the

164
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:38,049
first thing to do is to take stock of

165
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:39,799
the environment talking about in assets

166
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:43,940
secondary company's subsidiaries

167
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:47,510
etcetera the company of this size to do

168
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:50,330
this in a morning it's a difficult task

169
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:58,039
but you have to do it understand how the

170
00:18:50,330 --> 00:19:00,379
attack where it would come through so

171
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:04,340
you have to identify any see how the

172
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:09,970
technical ulnar abilities are mapped one

173
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:13,399
of the first points make a join of the

174
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,049
operations theater here we have the

175
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:19,129
offices distributed throughout the

176
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:23,350
country the main colors which are the

177
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:25,399
operational services port a airport X

178
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,699
extraction and distribution of gas

179
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:34,250
plants some offices in other countries

180
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:37,309
and a small cloud environment once we

181
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,980
have this map we have to understand what

182
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:44,020
tools we have available to defend the

183
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:46,299
environment firewall safety measures

184
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:52,158
technology available

185
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:54,470
connectional systems so the first thing

186
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:57,559
is to see what this map looks like

187
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,139
and then what tools we have to take

188
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:02,210
decisions that is the first protection

189
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:05,840
line the second line is detection and

190
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:11,120
response we want to know in which way we

191
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:14,658
can identify information about the

192
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:21,110
netbook what is going on and the points

193
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:23,809
at which collect this information so it

194
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,240
is important no there's detection

195
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:29,360
capabilities and how to react in case we

196
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,720
find something are generating backup

197
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,399
center etc and then there recovery we

198
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,529
have to understand the capabilities we

199
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,989
have to recover an environment that they

200
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:41,299
may be damaged and how critical this

201
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:48,620
will be to the function of the entire

202
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:54,340
system and archaeology processes and how

203
00:20:48,620 --> 00:21:03,168
much time I have this to respond and

204
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:06,500
prepare backups as as necessary ok this

205
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:08,090
is the core of work once we have

206
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,269
identified the business that

207
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:13,760
technological platforms we know more or

208
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:16,700
less the parameter of a company we have

209
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,120
to start to classify the platforms based

210
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,120
on the

211
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:27,280
mission critical value of each we have

212
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,320
to ask audit reports later on even tell

213
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,720
you the result of these audits the

214
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,500
network architectures Maps

215
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:39,940
communications and then the services

216
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:44,230
with third parties like b2b b2c the

217
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,930
administration employees etc and we have

218
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,850
to do this as fast as possible because

219
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:53,860
we have a low

220
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:56,409
we're very short of time this is the

221
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,260
coordination scheme we have to work as

222
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,840
fast as possible without missing

223
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:05,110
anything out and being in continuous

224
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,590
communication first we had three teams

225
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:11,500
working in parallel Orange coordinated

226
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:14,199
with his management and business and

227
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:21,130
what suggested made suggestions on the

228
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:23,100
basis of the results here in red was

229
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,600
quite complicated

230
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:30,659
interlocutors were validated by the top

231
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,659
management and groans in which we work

232
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,530
because we very paranoid to check for

233
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,260
microphones connections if we were being

234
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,800
followed because a lot of money was at

235
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,290
stake

236
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:54,909
so this department was at a very low

237
00:22:44,290 --> 00:23:00,040
profile main the vulnerabilities find

238
00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:01,500
gaps try to break through them we will

239
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,909
focus on the most critical

240
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,910
vulnerabilities and study the

241
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,720
combinations then the strategy is handed

242
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:13,870
over to to the new area with this

243
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:17,140
parameters of interest for him to his

244
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,149
team could define what to do but as we

245
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:27,160
had to keep a low profile

246
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:29,640
and avoid being detected to remain

247
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:35,800
untraceable and set of tools and swear

248
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:39,130
and launch process so once we had the

249
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,290
vulnerability analysis we were able to

250
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:46,120
penetrate we can see what part of the

251
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:48,280
network we ended up draw up a

252
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,320
vulnerability report which basically

253
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,540
said this is what I found I got as far

254
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,240
as this this is very complicated this

255
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,770
other part is very difficult and then we

256
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,290
had these three elements as the

257
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:03,160
technical complexity the information

258
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:08,320
required by an attacker to make use of

259
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:10,840
this information and the probability of

260
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,460
being detected every time we got

261
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,030
something from this guy from the blue

262
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:21,160
part as far as possible within the

263
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:26,020
stealthy approach we defined whether we

264
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:32,620
could mitigate it pathways and patch it

265
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:36,150
as a normal match abilities then two

266
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:38,770
weeks on end but we're talking about

267
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:43,020
systematic automatic system and I'm

268
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:50,500
coming very short of time way to

269
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:52,350
organize the response to the attack well

270
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:58,540
for gentleman said we went to a

271
00:24:52,350 --> 00:25:00,428
different location well we could be well

272
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,460
launch our from where we could launch

273
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:05,260
our attacks and then if we were detected

274
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,670
our contact within the organization will

275
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:12,100
let us know and then we will move away

276
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:17,590
from there and then now the task was

277
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:19,120
about seeing of verifying that in case

278
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:25,290
something was patched was properly

279
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,290
punched approach was waterlogged

280
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:32,549
we wanted to identify all the access

281
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:37,690
from IP addresses we used to check the

282
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:39,668
ranges of the public register entities

283
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,289
as well in the world and as well as

284
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:43,779
information that we got from the company

285
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:46,350
and then we discussed that internally to

286
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:51,100
see what each of those assets were

287
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:53,709
allocated so we have 14c classes there

288
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,629
were linked to businesses there were

289
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,450
some branches that were absolute no

290
00:25:55,629 --> 00:26:02,769
longer belonging to the company and we

291
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:05,499
also find some shadow IT that is to say

292
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:08,489
cat firms that were already deployed but

293
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:11,440
they were older and they were in

294
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:14,649
vulnerable server I said that was not

295
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,820
touched and also in difficult

296
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:22,149
environments we wouldn't like to go into

297
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,389
detail here and now we use the red team

298
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:28,840
tools and for their quick management

299
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:33,789
between the blue and red so we use the

300
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:36,070
effect dojo so dark generate ticket so

301
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:39,009
tar we would keep a count of all the

302
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,678
vulnerabilities that we detected so we

303
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:43,299
realized that we were in a nightmare so

304
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,909
you know that there is a person inside

305
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:48,309
and inside us so they are talking about

306
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:50,799
maintenance of the server then we

307
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:53,099
started to do the first turning the

308
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:57,158
fasting and then we started to see how

309
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:58,689
difficult it was to well we when we

310
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:01,090
analyzed them there were we find

311
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:03,039
vulnerabilities absolute networks so we

312
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,519
find ourselves a situation where we

313
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:10,179
wanted to protect a large infrastructure

314
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:12,609
but there was a professional inside

315
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:15,070
wanted to attack the organization and

316
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:17,259
create a big impact so when we asked for

317
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,090
the audit reports we went through them

318
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:21,940
and I'd like to share these with you so

319
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,918
that all of you being well that are red

320
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,259
and blue take these into account some

321
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,109
machines have been trivialized by the

322
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:33,119
former company that went to that company

323
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:35,949
to make an audit so they have left

324
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,779
software there that they use for the

325
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:42,460
pivoting so that was

326
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:46,450
impact to us because as I said before we

327
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:51,309
didn't know if the actually insider was

328
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:53,739
using it whether because we had access

329
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:55,658
to those audit reports

330
00:27:53,739 --> 00:28:00,909
apparently this person had technical

331
00:27:55,659 --> 00:28:05,409
expertise and knew how to well to do

332
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:08,649
administration it was not like genius

333
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:11,379
but he knew what he was doing so we

334
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:13,859
wanted what we could do to secure the

335
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:19,478
organization and to reduce impacts and

336
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:22,899
as well as to identify the insider so we

337
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:26,859
discussed that with the man but actually

338
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:29,468
this is very well by deduce but zero

339
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:31,149
trust so just don't want to trust anyone

340
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:32,469
when you are talking to administrators

341
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:34,748
you don't know whether the

342
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:37,139
administrators are the actually insider

343
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:40,299
do you know nothing about it

344
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:44,949
so the situation becomes extremely

345
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:46,570
complex we started working from the blue

346
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,690
team following the cement structure

347
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:53,739
first of all protection detection and

348
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:56,859
response recovering and then in then we

349
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:58,809
moved on to working on the central

350
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:01,899
feasibility of environment how the

351
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:04,089
different segmentation choose configure

352
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:08,649
such as fire world even if we couldn't

353
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:11,649
change organization overnight so we

354
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:13,809
could do some small adjustments if we

355
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:16,839
got information from the company about

356
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:20,918
the person or the insider which was

357
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:24,279
somehow trespassing and then because we

358
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:28,509
had information about the network that

359
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:32,679
allowed us to kind of monitor it without

360
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:35,649
generating lots of noise we inserted a

361
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,139
trunk mountainous which we took it to

362
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:40,119
one of our systems we did monitoring

363
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:44,408
from there and actually one of the

364
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:45,549
actions that were made there we took

365
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:49,059
advantage of one of the maintenance

366
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:50,379
windows so we identified a list of all

367
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:53,120
the program

368
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,640
windows for maintenance to see what are

369
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,679
the systems that will be implemented so

370
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,130
that we could capture the traffic to

371
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,620
analyze it analyzing with full traffic

372
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:06,050
of the organization it was just not

373
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:08,929
possible but at least we wanted to get

374
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:11,750
some information nothing that we did

375
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:16,400
checking as basis that there was an

376
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:23,060
insider in backup copies of the most

377
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:26,980
critical environments and accessible so

378
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:30,050
we took some drives from the

379
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,000
organization to secure them so that we

380
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,909
could ensure that we could recover a

381
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,550
critical server and some backup copies

382
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:44,510
were working we also took with us some

383
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:53,149
backup copies and what we found were a

384
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:54,920
bit lucky in one of the maintenance

385
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,020
windows we managed to cut our

386
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,060
information about the activity of the

387
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,920
attacker it was difficult for us to

388
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,450
analyze it but we could see that from

389
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,290
domain controller we could access an

390
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:08,600
external URL and we a number of binaries

391
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:12,320
were being unloaded we linked that

392
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:15,620
obviously and right away to the activity

393
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,409
that we have seen in the activity

394
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:22,850
reports that the agency had handed out

395
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:25,160
to us then we then we could see that the

396
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,719
connections of the domain controller we

397
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,000
didn't know how many people were

398
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,880
connecting to it

399
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,470
we could see some source machines but we

400
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,050
could see that Magua was being unloaded

401
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:39,110
and then from domain controller after

402
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:41,480
the unloading so we could see two

403
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:45,590
completely different systems that did

404
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,350
not fit in with the actual policy other

405
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:51,949
than the other activities that we

406
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:54,199
carried had we decided to investigate

407
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:57,360
what was happening into the system and

408
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:01,619
how we could trace back this environment

409
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:08,488
so what we could see from from the main

410
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:11,238
controller from as I said from domain

411
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:14,249
controller a number of tasks have been

412
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:17,580
executed one of them being adding an

413
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:19,470
admin user to a group and that was the

414
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,559
only group that had access to some

415
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:26,100
jumping machines then we could see that

416
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,499
that user was used to log into these

417
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,139
jump machines through the IP which was a

418
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:34,169
tool of those machine a number of tasks

419
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:37,350
were made one of them being creating a

420
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:41,850
local user then it knocked out and then

421
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:44,519
it knocked in again not through the IP

422
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:47,699
of the pool but from the machines that

423
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,070
has been created with the user then

424
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,629
locked out and then deleted the user

425
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:56,039
that was created in the domain

426
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:58,498
controller and then it when he knocked

427
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,799
out again so we were a bit kind of

428
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:06,119
terrified because those damn machines

429
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:12,179
gave access to all the control centers

430
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:13,889
and then orange started to discuss or to

431
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:17,070
communicate the situation to the whole

432
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:20,699
business and lots of stress was created

433
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:25,189
well we were now we were certain that it

434
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:27,690
was an entry channel and the

435
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:31,499
expectations that were very very

436
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:34,070
negative so that created that was of

437
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:34,070
high impact

438
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:46,889
all right now so they want to attack the

439
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,540
different control centers of the

440
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:51,810
businesses we want to secure them as

441
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:55,200
fast as possible and here blue had red

442
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:57,629
significant role to play so we decided

443
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:05,640
to take a look at the idea structure

444
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:10,050
access to the various environment if I T

445
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:12,179
security was a bit delicate and then in

446
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,130
terms of policy there will be lots of

447
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:17,280
problems in terms of juice software

448
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:20,100
fashions and then we were doing these

449
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,810
very carefully very quietly if you go to

450
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:25,199
a control center you tell them that

451
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:27,750
machines have to be updated that you

452
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,339
have to that they had to introduce or

453
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:33,960
make changes in users that would be a

454
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:36,030
bit crazy yet we were able to make some

455
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:43,530
adjustments to understand this ability

456
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:46,740
and to kind of obtain information from

457
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,960
the control centers so we made a number

458
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:55,678
of adjustments we change some of the

459
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:59,840
default users and what we did but the

460
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:03,690
whole organization could become aware of

461
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:06,980
and then we could see the access of this

462
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:09,780
in center and then we check whether the

463
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:12,420
insider could jump to one of them he

464
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,310
went to the data control center we were

465
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,920
really anxious about that because of the

466
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,840
potential impact that it could have we

467
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,600
suspected that that could happen we

468
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:25,290
monitored the attacker logging into that

469
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,480
jump machine and then one of the reduce

470
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,990
one of the default user with a very

471
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,090
simple password so our colleagues from

472
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,910
the previous presentation would have

473
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:39,420
found that password and position number

474
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:42,509
one or two so this is the one that the

475
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:46,820
users used and then he went in and then

476
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:50,420
he started to upload a number of tools

477
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:52,580
and then we could find out the software

478
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,450
that he was running he also tries some

479
00:35:52,580 --> 00:36:04,130
of the servers and here on these points

480
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:06,740
this is what red told me so now a very

481
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:10,190
complicated situation arose in the

482
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,200
crisis hair Commission do you have to

483
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,380
tell them where to press the red button

484
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:18,939
they have seen we have located an

485
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:22,640
entryway we have alternatives for Plan B

486
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:25,790
in terms of isolation in case we take

487
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:32,270
control and then they debate whether we

488
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:35,840
should take control now or not here

489
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:41,360
these points is where we explain them

490
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:44,660
where we wanted to go and now we move on

491
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,760
to deception environment for us it was

492
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,440
very important to secure all the ot

493
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,380
environments that could be accessed from

494
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,050
the jump machines have a very was

495
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,080
impossible for us to do this quick

496
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:59,690
patching to change everything that was

497
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,330
for leveling those machines because to

498
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,580
be honest that infrastructure had not

499
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:07,130
been secured for a long time with

500
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,590
exception of the jump machines and say

501
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,390
well if this sexual environment will

502
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,400
help us to detect activity of the

503
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,960
attackers security environment and to

504
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,770
find out what attacker is early that

505
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,050
would be welcome reception environment

506
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:22,700
could launch a more generic or more

507
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:25,460
targeted campaign each and every one is

508
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,439
about deploying elements elements across

509
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:31,130
my whole infrastructure is some of them

510
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,720
is being touched will get an alert very

511
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,070
interesting because the machines are not

512
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,649
connected to the production environment

513
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:40,030
but they are running parallel if someone

514
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:45,140
tries to log in order to scan them or

515
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:48,020
download something from them we know

516
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:50,529
where which machine has been compromised

517
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,640
and then we also have targeted campaigns

518
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:55,040
based on trial

519
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,140
previous intelligence well we decide to

520
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,660
include elements simulating the real

521
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,118
environment

522
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,670
and that would allow us to anticipate

523
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,210
the activity of the attacker find out

524
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:09,759
information finding out what he what are

525
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,200
his intentions and so that we are in

526
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:13,089
full control of the situation at all

527
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,118
times instead of the attacker

528
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:21,160
and this is the decision that we made so

529
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:21,910
when the attacker succeeded n3g

530
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,019
environment

531
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:28,089
he found that we have deployed a series

532
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:29,640
of machines some of them were similar

533
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:33,038
others were not similar we have

534
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,680
simulated from the jump machine that

535
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:39,339
engineering station was that the

536
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,740
attacker would reach would be with those

537
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:43,900
machine and then a number of services

538
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:47,769
and other machines had also been

539
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:50,230
deployed so these are so for the

540
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:52,959
attacker the this environment was

541
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:55,329
similar very similar to his so the

542
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,849
attacker try honest our system we took a

543
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:59,829
look at all the information real-time

544
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:01,960
information we could see that on the

545
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:03,759
console that was very very interesting

546
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:10,509
because at that point we already know

547
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:14,230
what the attacker was intending to do he

548
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:17,890
was he had approached him gas site and

549
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:23,470
then August facility and once we located

550
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:26,440
the attacker the system was made for us

551
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:29,288
to go into operation into contingency to

552
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:33,880
take control of all the systems and to

553
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:36,640
eliminate all the entryway every single

554
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,640
entryway but that could not be made

555
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,359
because the three groups trust with each

556
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,328
other and then also well we the top

557
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,859
management's also disagree with that and

558
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:49,839
then the top management said well we

559
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:51,970
know who is the attacker we know well he

560
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,339
wants to do we want to eradicate and we

561
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:57,578
as a blue team we persisted we refuse

562
00:39:54,339 --> 00:40:00,900
that because the takeover control is the

563
00:39:57,579 --> 00:40:00,900
most critical moment

564
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:09,240
the attacker will see that we are just

565
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,439
we have cut them and they will try to

566
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:15,600
harm the organization if you are not

567
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,640
well ready they will attack you from the

568
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,549
viewpoint of the blue team we were not

569
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:23,370
ready we were not ready to take in the

570
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:27,360
attack because the impact will be very

571
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:29,460
very significant but from the red team

572
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,480
perspective we wanted to minimize the

573
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:35,820
attack of course we knew that we will be

574
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,640
having collateral damage we will be

575
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:41,730
having production issues operational

576
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,350
issues but we didn't really want to risk

577
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,110
it and not to know where the attack

578
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:50,160
would be materialized and we just didn't

579
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:53,190
want to leave any entryway open so that

580
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,060
the attack becomes successful so no

581
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:05,120
matter the discussion control was shaken

582
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:07,410
so repairing the control taken was very

583
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:11,900
complex as well

584
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,899
based on the intelligence that we had

585
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:22,410
made to reduce exposure as much as

586
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,020
possible anything that we could manage

587
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:27,779
that would not have a significant impact

588
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,400
on the organization will be isolated or

589
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,890
stopped we don't know whether there are

590
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,020
any more inside us whether any more

591
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:37,440
systems have been compromised or not

592
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:42,930
but we decided to do to stop everything

593
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:45,600
so we could we looked into how we could

594
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:47,940
deploy each of the environments on how

595
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,860
to isolate each of the environment we

596
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,800
cannot really afford for the attacker to

597
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:56,780
access one office and from there to

598
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:03,060
access every single service so we

599
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:08,180
disabled all the communal F&E lines so

600
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:10,860
we we also disabled remote accesses

601
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,770
different environments were warned about

602
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:17,150
the contingency test to be carried out

603
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:25,519
so that the people responsible for that

604
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:28,220
should be pressing so a big big happen

605
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,078
so that everyone would be ready and then

606
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:33,019
at the same time we really wanted to

607
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,720
have as much real-time information as

608
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:38,240
much as possible so we just don't want

609
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,970
to call the law enforcement agencies to

610
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,390
come over and to take the attacker away

611
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:46,730
with them we just wanted to ensure we'll

612
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:51,440
be sure of everything that was taking

613
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:56,630
place of happening simultaneously we

614
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,640
also had to ensure access just in case

615
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:02,619
something went wrong because we have

616
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:06,249
already identified the attacker we made

617
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:09,799
forensic analysis of his machine we

618
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:12,230
identify all the activity taking place

619
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:15,499
in his machine we also identified all

620
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:19,220
the environment he has gained access to

621
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:22,220
we use different tools to analyze his

622
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:26,078
system all the systems he has accessed

623
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:30,890
so we check whether there was anything

624
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:35,809
strange or not and well that was that

625
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:45,348
was the end of my task ok oh no now if

626
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:48,730
you have to keep what you said putting

627
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:52,249
pressure on me for the last few days

628
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:54,799
well now the red team doesn't have so

629
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:58,750
much work but then now it has to help

630
00:43:54,799 --> 00:44:04,210
out the blue team ok let us cover it

631
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:04,210
[Laughter]

632
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:19,870
all right so now your blue finishing

633
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,560
okay we will restore the environment now

634
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:39,920
so when we took the control when we

635
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:46,490
continuty of the business we stopped the

636
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:50,990
environment so the domain controller did

637
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:55,339
not have an internet connection because

638
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:57,500
we could see that here together with the

639
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:00,020
rest of the elements that we have cut

640
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,710
off all the elements that we had

641
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:07,640
isolated little by little we have to go

642
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:09,770
back to business as usual but going back

643
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:14,450
to business as usual from this starting

644
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:18,860
point was about taking all the steps one

645
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:22,430
by one ensuring that the attacker was

646
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:25,130
not backing the organization so little

647
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:29,299
by little as I said we will be covering

648
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:35,990
the lines of communication the isolation

649
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:39,140
that users were into so when we were

650
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:41,930
starting their servers while reading was

651
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,640
making a number of tests we were

652
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:47,410
checking whether we could make

653
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:53,290
improvements in the configurations and

654
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:53,290
because we had a map of all the services

655
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:01,610
we were controlling the perimeter

656
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:06,320
continuously if there were any changes

657
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:08,990
in these services then we an alert was

658
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,840
triggered so we did our for the external

659
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:14,560
perimeter where we have all the IP

660
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,670
addresses as well as a critical

661
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:21,210
platforms so we set up

662
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:24,289
access rules and from there we were

663
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:28,170
monitoring five platforms specifically

664
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:33,839
obviously the crisis did not end here

665
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:39,150
lots of work was judged to be done first

666
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,869
of all ever since then the companies

667
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:43,950
Halliwell

668
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:51,589
of cybersecurity the organization is now

669
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:55,230
aware the company if highly exposed

670
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:57,089
business can be actually compromised and

671
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:02,609
there may be significant financial

672
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:05,788
losses so a number of lessons have been

673
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:09,828
learned so the first one that red line

674
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:16,200
on top the red line of an organization

675
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:19,589
it's different in the day to day life

676
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:22,859
in crisis scenario so that red line

677
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:25,859
could be legal nature or of any other

678
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:29,400
nature so here I just didn't want to add

679
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:31,799
any explanation or to that depends very

680
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,960
much on the DNA of the company of

681
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:36,538
decision-makers how much they want to

682
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,089
risk or not because they may have a

683
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:42,869
different risk appetite

684
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:47,519
other than that many conclusions can be

685
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:52,759
true for instance it is to respond to a

686
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:55,258
high impact incident not only security

687
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:58,009
capabilities orchestrating the whole

688
00:47:55,259 --> 00:48:05,460
incident in a manner that you launch

689
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:07,680
specific actions to face up to the risks

690
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,390
that have a direct impact on the

691
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,538
organization here we're talking about

692
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,700
the red and blue capabilities

693
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:17,900
capabilities that are to be targeted so

694
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:21,839
that at the end of the day everything is

695
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:23,279
aimed at the survival of the company at

696
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,900
that time when there are crisis

697
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:28,700
situations they don't care whether the

698
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,700
accounting system is down

699
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:35,890
anything that you do they just want you

700
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:38,980
to put an end to the crisis and how you

701
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:40,660
can't help company survive so when you

702
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,450
ask them about this and that they go and

703
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:45,609
say well you have to do that in now work

704
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:48,640
but then later on when they are the

705
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:51,760
crisis situation and they say well four

706
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:55,930
days is enough okay no problem we give

707
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:59,860
you all that time criticality of the

708
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:03,460
environments and the time periods

709
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:07,780
changed significantly and they below the

710
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:11,440
line we did not their crisis as well as

711
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:16,330
a crisis that we can see in the team the

712
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,820
stressful moments where you may be five

713
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:23,560
were the consequences of what you do may

714
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:27,640
also risk the life of people so that's a

715
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:30,190
high high stress stressful situation

716
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:33,060
well this is of a month now it is time

717
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,060
for questions

718
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:51,440
I know when I wanna congratulations

719
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:56,100
impressive Julio hello very interesting

720
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,280
however I feel that this is not cheap at

721
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,410
all

722
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:08,150
you think it could you give us an

723
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:13,339
estimation how much was that for

724
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:17,070
calathea in terms of time team etc

725
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:23,870
financial impact of responding with her

726
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:30,420
highly qualified team is very very low

727
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:37,310
considering the consequences so gas idea

728
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:40,470
has a turnover of 17 million if we have

729
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:42,900
highly critical environment so versus a

730
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:46,740
less critical environment so we are

731
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:49,820
talking about different sizing so all

732
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:54,270
these may start at the time of the

733
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:57,030
crisis processes recovery and when that

734
00:50:54,270 --> 00:51:01,310
happens we deploy full capabilities and

735
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:06,300
as I say the cost of it depends on the

736
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:10,890
capabilities that we deploy no well with

737
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:13,710
this I mean so that if we could when we

738
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:17,549
think about having a response capacity

739
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:24,720
in place we'll have to give allocate

740
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:29,810
figures to that or a customers well you

741
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,810
should finish off your presentation

742
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:39,220
so potential losses so one year out of

743
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:41,740
service because it pipes have been

744
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:45,160
destroyed so we'll be very is received

745
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,450
for you to mention that at the ends of

746
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,230
your presentation which are the

747
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:57,270
potential losses if you don't apply this

748
00:51:50,230 --> 00:52:04,060
any other questions in the meantime I

749
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:06,700
have a question what was the most

750
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:11,230
complex the most difficult part of this

751
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:14,500
process so what the red team do and then

752
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:19,420
the merger with the blue team what was

753
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:22,840
the most difficult date today or the

754
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:27,400
orange team fighting and battling with

755
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:31,420
the top management and officers this is

756
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,910
a very very difficult question well we

757
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:35,440
all sweat a lot we all works really hard

758
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:37,690
well we were never asked that question

759
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,210
but I think the most difficult part is

760
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:43,200
the blue part the moment you have to

761
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:47,230
secure something which is unsecure

762
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:51,819
that's the most difficult bit so that's

763
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:57,130
what the highest accountability lies yes

764
00:52:51,820 --> 00:53:00,160
it's desperated so you say I have it it

765
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:02,200
will be much realised it will happen for

766
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:06,129
sure whether you do it or not you may

767
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:13,259
have significance in fact but the most

768
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:18,100
difficult part is explaining the damage

769
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:19,750
that you are assuming to reduce

770
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,299
potential damage sitting down with

771
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:24,310
people and saying look if I stop this I

772
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,920
will stop all the communication between

773
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:29,170
the gas pipe and the headquarters all

774
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,840
the breakdowns that you will have you

775
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:35,080
will not be able to fix them however you

776
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:37,120
will have to pay these compensation and

777
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:40,000
then you will say yes these will be a

778
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,580
stop for a couple of days and you will

779
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,500
lose these amounts of money so that

780
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:46,880
debate that discussion is very very

781
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:50,130
difficult that's the most difficult part

782
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,619
well these could help you develop a

783
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:55,590
business case to be tortured businesses

784
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:58,740
schools very very interesting we'll have

785
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:00,690
the last question first of all

786
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:06,000
congratulations for the presentation

787
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:10,520
it's been very interesting from phase

788
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,520
zero to phase five how long did it take

789
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:28,800
well in case of gas idea that took few

790
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:33,930
days say two weeks so from the message

791
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:36,630
we knew well we were taking advantage of

792
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:42,089
maintenance windows is company to still

793
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:44,310
have maintenance every two weeks so two

794
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,930
days later we had information about what

795
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:54,049
was happening then they took a bit

796
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:58,169
longer to access the controller

797
00:54:54,050 --> 00:55:01,589
environments so that was took longer

798
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:07,520
that was over a week up until phase for

799
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:10,369
until recovery phase up until the

800
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:13,589
takeover of control then that was a week

801
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:14,990
okay last question now so

802
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:28,770
congratulations

803
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:33,479
I have a question which jump machine you

804
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:37,259
simulate what what they had before get

805
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:41,960
this process to avoid having an impact

806
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:41,960
on the system changing IP

807
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:54,020
the Machine the local user created had

808
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:58,080
the routing that we had cloned so we had

809
00:55:54,020 --> 00:56:02,880
separate and we made a channel and we

810
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:06,509
never fortunate if we wouldn't have seen

811
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:12,270
that user create in that machine he

812
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:15,840
connected to and to be discrete he

813
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:18,030
connected the user on the l1 so we took

814
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:21,360
it out from the pool and we substituted

815
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:24,450
in the honeypot environment once he was

816
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:26,250
connected there the visibility of the

817
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:29,009
machine was my virtual so we could

818
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:31,200
manage it transparently without damaging

819
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:33,390
the environment because we were thinking

820
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,520
the same as you and we had the attacker

821
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,900
inside we couldn't changes in the

822
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:41,940
infrastructure without raising the alarm

823
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:44,880
and we modified the environment but no

824
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:48,300
only the machine ok thank you very much

825
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:52,829
thank you congratulations

826
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,829
[Applause]
