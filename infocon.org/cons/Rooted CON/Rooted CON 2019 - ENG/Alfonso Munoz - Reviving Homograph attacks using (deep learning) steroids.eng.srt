1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:07,410
one of my nose okay good morning

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,870
everybody forget about the title I

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:37,410
always do this on purpose just to

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:39,690
intrigue you quick introduction all

5
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:46,559
these places if you want more

6
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:50,699
information you have all my data money

7
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:57,209
in case you wanted this is a special

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:59,280
mission wasting these minutes I'd like

9
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:06,740
to thank the organization for everything

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:10,110
they do my case I started with working

11
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:17,610
Reds so for this reason I've got to know

12
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:21,780
Roman and other people God said you know

13
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:26,430
this congratulations for everything we

14
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:42,180
have achieved ratios this is something

15
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:48,350
that things happen afterwards this is

16
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,350
the seventh time speaking at

17
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:32,829
so we started professional security

18
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:32,830
hodgkins X but also suspicious people

19
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:51,200
so the professional type of people do

20
00:02:48,470 --> 00:03:00,709
businesses I feel smart you can't reduce

21
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:07,459
yes I will say presentation setup so

22
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:11,230
beyond my knowledge base we got and we

23
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:14,150
got people students got in touch with

24
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:17,209
secondary students interested in

25
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:22,540
developing hardware projects and privacy

26
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:25,880
terms rotor the roots it and the

27
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,970
influence it has so what of watching

28
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,100
five minutes already

29
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,670
anyway now I'll tell you what my agenda

30
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,560
is for this presentation I like to

31
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,890
theorize a lot so there's a question

32
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,720
there ideas make myself free whether we

33
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,529
can intimidate the best possible

34
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:50,170
attacker because the defenders always a

35
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:55,250
step behind the attacker in the theory

36
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:57,679
this is more the perfect attacker who

37
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,930
has unlimited resources and limited

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,390
knowledge and the limited access

39
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,879
la capacidad de Modell are not acanti so

40
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,488
if we were able to model an attack among

41
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,739
these characteristics as defenders we

42
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:17,120
might become the best defenders so let's

43
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:19,789
see if this can be done about

44
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,900
intelligence application at artificial

45
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:29,449
intelligence my apologies I'm not going

46
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:31,429
to talk about offensive security to know

47
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:44,380
what became a filing out Michelle

48
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:56,300
yearning applied to our unique or

49
00:04:44,380 --> 00:05:08,930
unicode conventional response after that

50
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:12,430
give you a few examples actually so when

51
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,430
we talk about artificial intelligence

52
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:24,039
Terminator is the first thing that comes

53
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:26,240
to mind like kill us all Terminator but

54
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,400
just have to take a look at the amount

55
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,000
of money then governments are investing

56
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:36,799
in picking the best brains of each

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,680
country to work for their own defence in

58
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,520
Spain this thing is sort of are a bit

59
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,520
slower

60
00:05:43,120 --> 00:06:01,199
but it in quanta Soviet offensive

61
00:05:45,190 --> 00:06:01,199
Umatilla money as regards typical change

62
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:11,340
using artificial intelligence branches

63
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:19,410
security artificial intelligence

64
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,750
mixed attacks which is the theft of

65
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:29,289
intelligence models optimization of

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:43,389
machine learning model in German this

67
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:46,650
right now to a website that works how to

68
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:49,200
simulate real faces how to flux of five

69
00:06:46,650 --> 00:07:11,340
authentication mechanisms of all time

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:07:15,760
fingerprints voice audio video etc nor

71
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:19,900
expensive professional companies we are

72
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,900
expensive companies to users to apply

73
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:27,099
the best defensive measurement see get

74
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:32,469
set aside on human interface so I could

75
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:35,860
be reasonable to think that do not

76
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,919
imitate humans a hundred percent but

77
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:53,280
could spawn up to about 60 70 percent of

78
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:53,280
accuracy could think about you me

79
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:47,100
as well so if we go to this commercial

80
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:50,560
in because they're not to be trusted

81
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:54,430
focus on public we can see the majority

82
00:08:50,560 --> 00:09:03,189
are focused on the agile hygiene phasing

83
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:07,260
procedures listed faster here have the

84
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:19,210
links so you can check them out for

85
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:21,580
improving SQL queries or website did you

86
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,700
know that in map you used magista for

87
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,310
regression to identify ipv6 when I

88
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:38,440
didn't know that so don't feel bad if

89
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:57,550
you didn't explore all the cases we have

90
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:59,529
done is sufficient not then used

91
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,620
the system models under the numinous

92
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:06,670
neural networks and there's a splice

93
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:12,790
yeah it's a very simple idea see we'll

94
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:17,260
have a senior and junior tester system

95
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:21,069
it has a web server and launching

96
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,439
exploits a bit of luck it works

97
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,000
a senior tester will you make a list and

98
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:32,529
with greater knowledge we'll go to the

99
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:36,190
specifics similar use its uses listing

100
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:38,080
with met exploit and it learns when it

101
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:42,970
learns that some experts work better for

102
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:46,420
some numbers he focuses on it and so on

103
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:48,100
so it's not like a human untested but

104
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:54,699
this is one of the most advanced things

105
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:58,990
that we have seen publicly you can

106
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:01,029
download even play with it after the

107
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,820
previous presentation by born on Hyman

108
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:07,660
well please know everything related to

109
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:13,089
cracking is moving exponentially using

110
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:15,990
this type of technology in this case for

111
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:18,100
generating mutation are you taking

112
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,589
dictionaries of the keys that have been

113
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,140
stolen for instance you generate me

114
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:27,329
attention wrong and then they use the

115
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,329
typical tools that we used by question

116
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,110
so this was the introduction captured

117
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:37,180
your interest

118
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:39,820
I hope it seems that large organizations

119
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:43,089
to understand about security like DARPA

120
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:46,029
and others are analyzing this and we see

121
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:48,520
what we have on the public side it's not

122
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:52,899
for amateur but it seems to make some

123
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:57,310
interests stay with the same procedure

124
00:11:52,899 --> 00:12:03,680
in my mind but now we will focus on

125
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:08,260
Unicode encoding attacks this is all but

126
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,060
for some reason I wanted to know what

127
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,750
it's a redundant question but what do

128
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,250
these problems have in common the senior

129
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:26,570
ones here wouldn't know if you've got

130
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:30,080
evasion of HTTP ideas occultation more

131
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,870
recent problem is Apple finds bug that

132
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:37,520
causes iPhones to crash with a unique

133
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:45,250
old problem here we have a number of

134
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:48,040
headlines failures mainly by Apple for

135
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,980
incorrect processing of Unicode change

136
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:58,790
take a look at these things because I

137
00:12:50,980 --> 00:13:00,980
discuss about browsers any spanish

138
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:06,709
company so the only one I will attack

139
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:08,779
here is rooted anyway problem is Java I

140
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:12,890
mean I don't many people hate Java

141
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:14,839
I'm sorry but I like a security failure

142
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:18,020
you see in this code I develop this code

143
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,720
this simulates a server a payload and

144
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:24,230
port which is of course fake a socket

145
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,880
and I prin print a screen message so

146
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,740
what is the security problem in this

147
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,120
cold

148
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:33,980
it's very quickly because I'm running

149
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:40,160
out of time I won't come on someone has

150
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:42,230
to identify failure is right here I'm

151
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,850
not calling the class system in Java

152
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:49,279
here we have a package talks about

153
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:54,160
system here the actual change is that

154
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:59,870
this s is not an lettin it serially so

155
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,370
confuse to altered source code you have

156
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,020
to take this into account because

157
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,020
someone can have to save you with this

158
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:12,730
so taking this into account in case

159
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:16,020
someone doesn't know what money code is

160
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:19,720
a single slide to show unicode is a

161
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:23,069
representation system for exchanging

162
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,070
text in multiple languages

163
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,040
the only thing unicode is that there is

164
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,750
a huge amounts of characters the last

165
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:40,360
version 100,000 characters and these are

166
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:42,910
grouped in blocks this is a we wants to

167
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,800
evade protection measures set by

168
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:52,420
browsers security problems in unicode

169
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:56,829
and countermeasures focus on the right

170
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:58,810
side the homograph attacks these block

171
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:04,540
is related to unicode encoding and your

172
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:05,859
tanks to develop countermeasures to

173
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,240
these attacks you need a lot of

174
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:13,330
knowledge focused on good application

175
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,740
security testing facing processes safe

176
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:20,470
development and in-depth security so I'm

177
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:24,850
not going to get into detail here

178
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:26,350
because is a software very well I will

179
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:32,160
focus on this one who writes the

180
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:36,340
homograph attacks many of you know this

181
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,189
this is your URL example with BBVA this

182
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:42,700
typically thing we talk about where do

183
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,620
we get attacks you are ready that's it

184
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,440
but I put it sincerely concerns matching

185
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:52,620
so visually it looks the same but

186
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:55,450
they're different in order to protect

187
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,089
against these attacks the industry to

188
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:08,629
Virata unicode

189
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:13,910
konista standard web browser introduces

190
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:16,279
force URL in Cyrillic someone could try

191
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:20,689
to one to a phishing attack on baby yeah

192
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:29,600
yeah well the attack will have a hard

193
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:32,929
time doing it so questions palace is

194
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,669
used by browsers to protect us against

195
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:37,339
these situations are they always

196
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:47,359
functional do they always work sometimes

197
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:52,489
yes sometimes not usable are critical

198
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:59,149
those characters that seem could be used

199
00:16:52,489 --> 00:17:01,100
by an attack could generate all the

200
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:03,199
possible characters inseminate the best

201
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:09,769
possible attack time if you simulate

202
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:12,519
that best attacker like we could see if

203
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:12,519
this is possible

204
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:26,119
apart from doing fishing that you can

205
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:32,240
analyze a source code it could deceive a

206
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:38,320
model to call words channel property

207
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:42,700
mechanism etc etc visually similar

208
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,700
character is can be used for many things

209
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:53,690
timewise I'm doing ok apparently what

210
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:56,179
have we done here one try to generate

211
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,139
the best section of confusable for this

212
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,139
I will use deep learning

213
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:09,970
this was a long process I would

214
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:14,520
summarize it in a couple of slides try

215
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:18,480
to do with an automatic procedure

216
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,879
visually similar characters for humans

217
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:26,130
but without using a human was so we

218
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:31,510
picked up was the entire Latin alphabet

219
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:34,030
and we compared each character visually

220
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,280
was thirty eight thousand eight hundred

221
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:40,270
Unicode characters the system was

222
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:43,270
something like this there's a lot of

223
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:46,240
science behind this but it says look

224
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:48,760
simply so we took the visual

225
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,540
representation of each letter and

226
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:56,890
compared it with all the Unicode with a

227
00:18:52,540 --> 00:19:01,030
neuron and network system so we got a

228
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:05,430
probability if you enter an A and B this

229
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:14,620
is like so playing with this percentage

230
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:17,680
you can get many similarities the best

231
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,489
confusable dictionary existing on this

232
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:25,240
planet I generally you know if it's URL

233
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,350
tools the typical tools for phishing or

234
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:32,440
falsifying domains

235
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:34,389
well quite better than that if we want

236
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,940
to use better even better so yeah we can

237
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:42,070
use the Unicode started as reference

238
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,160
basically you put a character in and it

239
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:48,340
shows you visually similar characters

240
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:52,420
like this one here is from the Unicode

241
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:55,330
and here this is not so with all the

242
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,560
system tip you learn we developed a

243
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,560
texture that is better

244
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,370
conventional dictionary so we got 50

245
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,649
similar characters too for each

246
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,889
character and here we have a quality

247
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:14,010
above 10 15 percent this quality

248
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:19,230
percentage is subjective because when

249
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:21,390
you see an aim in a or not depending on

250
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:26,490
each human being and this is done by

251
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:32,190
machine visually check it gives an

252
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:38,060
improvement of 10 50 percent that you

253
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:43,170
can use deep learning in offensive tools

254
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:47,220
a summary of this which is quite ugly

255
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:51,830
but as you can see it's not very pretty

256
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,830
you can download it it is accessible for

257
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:58,800
for example for a letter A but there are

258
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,870
others that are visually more similar

259
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,030
another there are less similar some will

260
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,580
be more useful for some scenarios and

261
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,139
others another however it is important

262
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,689
to have all the possible combinations

263
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,050
because this will allow us to test a

264
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:17,490
number of scenarios so what do we do

265
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:20,280
with all this we create you all right

266
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,280
deep to very deep you can download it

267
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:28,139
from github as you can see that this

268
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,470
tool includes many of the current

269
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,060
techniques for generating files domains

270
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,390
and see if anyone is trying to do a

271
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:40,649
fishing but it has other advantages one

272
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:46,020
is that it uses this dictionary so if

273
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:48,660
you work in any organization test all

274
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:54,600
the possible domains that an attacker

275
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:56,850
may use for doing an efficient so you

276
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,250
can download it and play with it other

277
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,169
characteristics now I will tell you

278
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:05,910
about this

279
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:10,710
you're not this dictionary created best

280
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:17,670
dictionary on about confusion so let's

281
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:24,440
see some examples I will show you three

282
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:26,670
cases one or with URL then intellectual

283
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,740
property protection you can the last

284
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:38,280
example which is close to my heart is

285
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:40,800
related to the CIA later on the best

286
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:45,720
possible dictionary that an attacker can

287
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:48,629
use I took a look to see what the bad

288
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,660
guys are able to do so I made a list of

289
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:56,280
all the Spanish Stock Exchange company

290
00:22:51,660 --> 00:23:05,520
the avid certified analyst all the live

291
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:13,410
SME 25,800 33 SMEs so I made the online

292
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:16,139
betting websites separately ten thousand

293
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,170
talk of domains these domains you see

294
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:23,010
here in case of Spain exactly live

295
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:29,640
active domain some are registered by the

296
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:36,080
companies at least maybe you should take

297
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:38,040
a look at your policies in detects bank

298
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,840
Garcia McCain which is cheese

299
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,280
manufacturer I would like him to be

300
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:48,290
caught what is defenses down because I

301
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:51,000
like the cheese this is funny example

302
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:55,190
analyzing the busy day I've got this one

303
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,780
this is VB v4 which is the Chinese

304
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:01,800
website it would never go down as fishy

305
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,379
but you can imagine what it is a funny

306
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:08,260
thing

307
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,260
here we see in the red line of domains

308
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,820
not only the domain the attackers could

309
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,340
use because there's a huge amount of

310
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,100
domains that could be registered these

311
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,199
are only the live ones

312
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,899
the top domains are ten thousand I

313
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,720
indentified twenty thousand eight

314
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,000
hundred thirty-six URLs that are

315
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:36,940
distributed in rubbish samsoon this is

316
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,940
nice without sort of triangular Amazon

317
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:46,300
so the attackers use these combinations

318
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:52,340
this dictionary we can identify them

319
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:56,540
maybe someone wondered as well with

320
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,820
these URLs but in the end if you click

321
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,550
on a URL it will take you to a browser

322
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:04,909
and the browser will implement some

323
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:07,820
protection that will expand that you are

324
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:11,150
right to increase your protection here

325
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:13,370
are two different topics one is that the

326
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:16,100
browser will expand the URL doesn't mean

327
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:19,040
that the URL cannot execute an exploit

328
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:22,459
or JavaScript so we have to evolve

329
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,340
anyone deceiving us to click on a Ural

330
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:28,040
beyond the protection of the browser

331
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:33,470
then we have the browser protection per

332
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:37,670
se this is an example of security policy

333
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:43,460
followed by crow to decide it has to

334
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:46,700
expand the website you can spend hours

335
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:50,020
to see you can think about some it's an

336
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,020
area that can avail

337
00:25:51,180 --> 00:26:01,830
this is what hotels the majority of

338
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:04,320
cases are covered so here potential

339
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:08,040
character with which you can create

340
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,350
humanoids that in a vein protection

341
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:17,730
imagines of Chrome and Firefox and other

342
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:25,639
browsers fishing I did to the river town

343
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:28,710
nobody gets angry with a dot underneath

344
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,350
so I've claw into the web so whether you

345
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:35,810
read deep you can until the minus L

346
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:39,060
option and you get potential domain

347
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:47,100
minus C option and you can check whether

348
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:55,500
they live or not targeted fishing or

349
00:26:47,100 --> 00:27:05,159
whatever you can not very far to ID any

350
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:08,670
policies this can be done with all the

351
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:14,190
companies the of the ix35

352
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:17,130
and SMS countermeasures in browsers in

353
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,860
the case of our Firefox they towards the

354
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:23,310
application of unique or if you force it

355
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:26,040
it does not execute these are ID and

356
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,950
policies so this attack wouldn't work so

357
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,980
if you do about configuring if I have

358
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:34,770
Fox and your force this is Q it would

359
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,710
expand and a case of chrome you have to

360
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:40,830
install some extension in this specific

361
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:48,180
case if someone introduces this rooted

362
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:51,000
Khan websites the period trigger so you

363
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:54,810
can force in this because if you have

364
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,370
URL they could to save you

365
00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:01,500
I love this picture so what happens with

366
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:05,340
all this we have seen that there

367
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:09,290
couldn't be specific scenarios just a

368
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:12,840
few that could evade the ideon browser

369
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:16,500
policies and apart from that even though

370
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:21,750
it expands the URL if you click on it it

371
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:24,150
could activate exploit JavaScript

372
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,180
whatever something good we did in this

373
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,830
industry is in-depth security I want to

374
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:33,030
know before the browser gets the place

375
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:35,760
the URL I get the media how easy is it

376
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,950
to deceive me because I don't want it

377
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,680
not only to expand but also to not

378
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:49,050
execute anything so I took a quick look

379
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:55,850
at a load of email what subterra met

380
00:28:49,050 --> 00:29:01,350
cetera so we started with emails outlook

381
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:04,230
Gmail 1:10 with a score of 10 or outlook

382
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:06,090
on Yahoo if you put a unit code it

383
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:10,560
doesn't allow you to click it so you had

384
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:13,409
to go to the browser user you enter a

385
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:20,879
user with Unicode code it doesn't allow

386
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:23,160
it in the case of proton is this

387
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,560
Israelis MIDI controller the URL

388
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,770
applicable so you have to have

389
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:32,040
experience at the bottom if the browser

390
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:38,340
will expand it if we use the tool we

391
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:45,000
enter a domain that deceives to main

392
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:48,260
protection you can get in poorest one in

393
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,260
this regard is Gmail

394
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:01,210
it'll be approvable in case of users you

395
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:05,650
can enter false user with unicode

396
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:10,630
encoding so I send an email to Romana

397
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:13,390
you've taught CEO at Farrakhan's and in

398
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:16,780
copyright it's not the CEO but the CEO

399
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:19,900
instead of being let's see I put it in

400
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:22,810
Cyrillic right now gmail allows you into

401
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,090
sending emails in recipients will

402
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:27,370
receive it I have some training in

403
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,709
security it won't be able to visually

404
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:37,689
differentiate whether the mail is from

405
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:40,240
the genuine CEO or the bogus e this is

406
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:43,090
allowed by Gmail so you report it to

407
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,450
them and they say this is not a security

408
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:49,000
danger so just be aware that this is a

409
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,100
this can be done through Gmail if we

410
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,350
talk about instant messaging which is

411
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:57,879
where the party is if we talk about

412
00:30:53,350 --> 00:31:01,649
Skype in the mobile application wave on

413
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,650
desktop they perceive differently

414
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:09,129
desktop version there is no human way

415
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:11,590
unless you copy and compare real as well

416
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:15,490
as domain is true or false they can

417
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:17,020
intercede in this case Microsoft has

418
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,300
managed this quite well

419
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,770
I reported it to them they admitted it

420
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,980
was a security failure and they

421
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:26,410
corrected it they published it in the

422
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:30,270
safety in the security bulletins and

423
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:33,550
that was it others do a good job

424
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:35,620
Facebook Twitter they do a good job in

425
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:38,590
the case of LinkedIn there are some

426
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,709
scenarios were they act poorly if you

427
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:44,530
publish an article URL is not properly

428
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:47,560
expanded so you could be deceived there

429
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:53,440
in other types of instant messages and

430
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:56,050
social media Instagram and twitch they

431
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,120
don't allow to be clicked but doesn't

432
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:01,440
expand it either so they are in the

433
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:06,100
middle of a ground so

434
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:09,310
if you uses a free social media it's

435
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,500
relatively easy to deceive the final

436
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:15,300
user there are no mechanism for you to

437
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,300
see whether the page is legit or not

438
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:22,450
in case of signal Telecom what's up this

439
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,030
is an actual disaster there is no

440
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:28,030
possible way for you to know whether the

441
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:34,240
URL is legit or not so in the case of

442
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:36,940
signal we have the desktop there is no

443
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,630
visual way for you to tell that this is

444
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:45,040
false domain this has been this is in

445
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:47,800
Latin and this is in Cyrillic I've

446
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:51,070
reported that to signal they just ignore

447
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:53,770
it and the same goes for telegram well

448
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:56,320
when in this case this was the answer

449
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:59,290
that I got well thank you very much

450
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,590
Alfonzo but another security expert

451
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,920
reported it to us five years five days

452
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,709
ago

453
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,710
in the case of whatsapp I also reported

454
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:11,950
his failure and they said they did not

455
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:15,760
consider it a security failure so well

456
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:19,540
wear this in mind now if we go to G

457
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,870
Street Microsoft Office they are acting

458
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:25,060
rightly they're doing it well even they

459
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,189
give you good enough information for you

460
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:31,980
to detect that someone is trying to

461
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:35,530
deceive you and open office you can be

462
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:42,310
deceived very easily because they act

463
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:45,820
very poorly Google any so final users

464
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:47,919
and users have difficulties in telling a

465
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,540
digit domain from an on digit one I

466
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:53,670
reported it they ignore it

467
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:56,860
in case of PDF accrued of Acrobat Reader

468
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:58,690
does it quite well and in case of Foxit

469
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,590
reader I don't know what have you use it

470
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:05,980
or not this is the typical reader of for

471
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:10,870
PDF files of Fox 8 who doesn't have his

472
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:12,440
purity in I reported it to them they are

473
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:16,129
serious people they

474
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:19,369
acknowledged the security fader and they

475
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:22,038
will be including it in the security

476
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:24,619
bulletins next month and for those of

477
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:30,139
you who are a bit lazy this is a summary

478
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:31,069
table these are the ones I have detected

479
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:35,720
a failure

480
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:38,779
Skype desktop well admitted program is

481
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:41,538
trying to fix it is fixing it these

482
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:45,020
other two foxy Freddy did not answer

483
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:48,520
these are the two answers but they said

484
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:51,079
that they would not implement any

485
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,699
security changes and they says well that

486
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,139
what I did was just social engineering

487
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,480
that they were not interested in that

488
00:34:54,139 --> 00:35:02,869
okay does this is a summary table for

489
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:05,630
you to bear in mind and now I just

490
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:09,099
didn't want you to feel that these

491
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:12,740
confusable yes I'm I'm pretty fast

492
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:14,780
because I'm finishing I just didn't want

493
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,970
you to have the feeling that this is

494
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:20,510
only good for fishing or to detect force

495
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:24,529
to mean confusable can be used in any

496
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:29,109
scenario where someone needs to process

497
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:35,210
a text as if there is a human person

498
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:41,180
around or reporting it may use it may

499
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:43,849
find it just to finish off I'd like to

500
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:49,399
share with you two examples one is about

501
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:52,250
IP bypassing IP tools until one about

502
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:58,119
creation of cover channels the first one

503
00:35:52,250 --> 00:36:01,069
please to not get angry I know that

504
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:03,440
delivering a speech and Bridget car is

505
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:04,910
cool being a hacker is good but actually

506
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,910
we're able to be the coolest of the

507
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:11,649
coolest will be to be the Prime Minister

508
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:15,910
of the company of Surrey of the country

509
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:18,910
so it is a common when you plagiarize

510
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,910
PhD

511
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:29,810
yeah phonetics is a service and writing

512
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:34,080
a PhD is lots of hard work I know it

513
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:35,850
because I've wrote her PhD myself so now

514
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,640
that I take a look at the progress are

515
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:41,069
reduced to detect plagiarism we start

516
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,259
off on the right with placards comer

517
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,950
I've reported it to the manufacturers

518
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:50,430
they also ignored me that I reported in

519
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:54,299
five or six months ago have not answered

520
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:58,169
yet so I just enter a text from the key

521
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:02,730
shadi so anyone could identify that

522
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:05,070
receives a text from fishery so when you

523
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,830
enter the original text clatter scan

524
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:10,740
tells you that you have copied it with

525
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:13,170
99% and likeliness what will happen see

526
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:17,520
if you replace one character instead of

527
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:20,640
letting a you just typing Cyrillic a so

528
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:25,320
the probability goes down to 0% so you

529
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:28,640
fully these series I don't know whether

530
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:33,000
some of the well some of you who are

531
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,910
following master's course please be

532
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,580
careful with this too so in case of

533
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:41,129
Turnitin which is a software widely used

534
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:46,950
at many universities we could say that

535
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:50,430
10:18 be better so to be honest I

536
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:54,290
devoted half an hour to these tests so I

537
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:57,839
didn't do a food auditing but these

538
00:37:54,290 --> 00:38:02,070
texts of each other they 100% went down

539
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:05,520
to 18% so in this case I did not read

540
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:12,660
case one character only but I needed to

541
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:15,330
replace more than one characters well

542
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:18,569
because this is just because of the

543
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:20,930
algorithm that Turnitin is using even if

544
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:24,740
it may sound a bit all to you

545
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:28,919
many software is not good as

546
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:30,959
validation another example will be

547
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,200
creation of covered channels

548
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:40,380
we have published the tool which shows

549
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:42,450
on the screen it is a bitter Russian tea

550
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,490
spoon offers several options it allows

551
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:51,419
you to create coverage channels by using

552
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:53,129
confusable facility to other things if

553
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,950
you were to then Laura today the

554
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:59,280
features that perform are these ones

555
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:03,210
here so the previous previous tools were

556
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:07,079
made in Python this is developed in Java

557
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:10,500
to just enter enter text of your choice

558
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:13,109
then the message that you want to hire

559
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,910
to cover and then this is a result the

560
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:19,770
result uses confusable as well as an ID

561
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:22,140
system to hide cover the information you

562
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:24,480
see that in with the text but you could

563
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:27,598
use that in social media this is an

564
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,920
example from Twitter here we are using

565
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:37,230
confusable to code information and here

566
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:41,339
we have some 40 bits that we can cut

567
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:44,130
from these two in the future in the

568
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:47,880
future we'll work with text PDF word

569
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:54,329
HTML we will be adding a feature this

570
00:39:47,880 --> 00:40:02,270
one here defended me to create a psycho

571
00:39:54,329 --> 00:40:07,740
libraries that are transparent using

572
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:11,009
plug into library so that a would do

573
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:13,078
stay calm in the bathroom so you

574
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:16,670
configure it and everything that comes

575
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:20,819
straight all the techniques will help

576
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:25,020
code all these techniques we will be

577
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:28,619
entering other techniques that are best

578
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:31,559
known so the use of tagging for creating

579
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:33,809
uncovered channels so this is an example

580
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:38,010
where we use non-printable tax in

581
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:40,559
unicode to create covered channels you

582
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:43,520
can do that in Twitter this is what the

583
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,710
user can see however at the end

584
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,480
today there are some coats of Unicode

585
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:52,070
that are not visible so therefore you

586
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:56,150
can't covered quite some information so

587
00:40:52,070 --> 00:41:05,570
actually this is the amount of data that

588
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:07,900
have been covered so to finish analyze

589
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:10,910
the developments and advancement in

590
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,640
offensive security who is in telling

591
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,670
artificial intelligence actually there

592
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:20,569
is more hype than actual work or results

593
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:26,260
yet we are seeing some examples hopeful

594
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:32,300
examples about his future practicality

595
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:37,370
it is sad to see some Unicode coding

596
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:42,350
issues are still impacting us today so

597
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:46,850
this continues to be there and because

598
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:50,029
security is never fully or buddy ready

599
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:53,240
enough so this is a full dictionary of

600
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:58,490
confusable use it to test security in

601
00:41:53,240 --> 00:42:00,169
any type of applications I will show you

602
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:02,569
this example Spanish oh there are very

603
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,150
many others out there but also would

604
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,630
like to put at your disposal a really

605
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,670
deep

606
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,350
tool you will see all the possible

607
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,050
combinations that an attacker might use

608
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:14,390
to make fish into you you cannot seduce

609
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,310
them to see which are these domains that

610
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,520
are life and those that are not life and

611
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:21,980
in case you do pen testing right team

612
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:29,570
exercises this will help you generate

613
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:33,650
URLs offering security Firefox Chrome

614
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:37,580
etc and think about this and bear it in

615
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:40,910
mind and consider the other scenarios

616
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:44,870
but you could use it other than URLs I

617
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:47,540
would like to thank Roma because I've

618
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:49,279
been sending him fishing for two months

619
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,560
now i a server like so

620
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,900
thank me well for giving me a hand with

621
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,779
a juice our cousin Sam who are the

622
00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:00,290
people who know the most about

623
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:02,300
artificial intelligence and well this is

624
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,500
all for me thank you very much for your

625
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,500
time and attention

626
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:16,549
[Applause]

627
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:19,070
I've gotta be fast central questions so

628
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:22,250
thank you very much great for the

629
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:24,350
library so please pass on dhikr to me

630
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:28,310
and then we will compile them in dll and

631
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:29,960
then we will have 32 in you for your

632
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:33,700
questions please use the microphones

633
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,700
provided there is a question over there

634
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:44,060
hello one-fall so impressive

635
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:46,390
presentation impressive as always I have

636
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,390
two questions

637
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:54,170
so creating malicious URLs in doing so

638
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:56,930
have you checked whether people rate the

639
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:59,510
full URL or just the beginning of the

640
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,250
URL has more white so to speak because

641
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:07,250
perhaps when it comes to creating the

642
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:08,750
tool you prefer to include the

643
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,820
characters at the ends of the URL

644
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:12,800
because people may not read their full

645
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:15,170
URL no I didn't do that but actually

646
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,030
what the tool does it has this all the

647
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:19,100
possible combination sufferings to see

648
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,440
if you tap in Bridgette calm it is sort

649
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,640
of we are and then all the possible

650
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,010
characters for that you generate

651
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,049
settlement then it goes to then

652
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,940
generates all the domains so the logic

653
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,010
that you I share with me it's not

654
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,700
followed as it does cut it no no no it

655
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:39,860
doesn't do any scoring actually it does

656
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:42,649
all the possible combinations for a non

657
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:45,590
domain for instance often if X company

658
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:47,690
you may end up with 2,000 or 3,000

659
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:50,710
different combinations but yet what you

660
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:53,390
are saying could be very interesting

661
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:55,370
thinking about in terms of the attacker

662
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:58,730
another question now

663
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:03,770
so imagine that I am the hitaka and I

664
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:05,660
want to make fish into apple similarity

665
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:12,340
between characters have attractive

666
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:17,330
resources versus Unicode most used font

667
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:21,380
in Apple no I didn't cover that so that

668
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:23,600
could be useful word you're saying so I

669
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:26,960
showed you this example with a Latin

670
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:30,770
character but you could also try it out

671
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:34,220
with other languages we did some testing

672
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:36,710
with Chinese language imagine that you

673
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,810
want to make fish into the Chinese deep

674
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:42,440
learning also allows you to use

675
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:44,750
different combinations what I showed you

676
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,670
was for the level of characters but for

677
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:49,000
these type of attacks you can combine

678
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:52,910
more than one character to make one say

679
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,060
yo and with I don't know with another

680
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:59,870
symbol and then you get like a different

681
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,980
combination but what I did was more

682
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,690
generic but what you are saying

683
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:06,050
specifically could make it very

684
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,350
interesting any other questions in the

685
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:10,610
room

686
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:15,190
well I have one myself please come back

687
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:17,960
to the URL of LinkedIn instead of

688
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:27,670
targeting determine have you thought

689
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:30,560
about targeting the HTTP semicolon - -

690
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:33,920
well that will be a domain when you

691
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:39,259
click on it when you register the domain

692
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:41,540
you go through all the regulations my

693
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,790
experiences has followed Italian other

694
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:45,620
providers and when I shared that with

695
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:51,800
other people that did similar thing

696
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:57,200
first you seen a teensy bit register so

697
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:59,210
URL if you don't we are not in these

698
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,390
strange situations that I share with you

699
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:04,940
most of the register asking you to

700
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:06,859
register it in Unicode formats and that

701
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,790
you cannot change it in the dictionary

702
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,500
have false

703
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:12,910
semi

704
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:14,530
four dashes but no I couldn't do it I

705
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:19,210
tested it and I couldn't get through

706
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:23,380
okay well we could test it ourselves

707
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:25,780
later on very interesting helpful so is

708
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,970
there an last question well no more

709
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:32,590
questions oh yes there is one question

710
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:37,060
Oh a brave person has a question so when

711
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:38,890
you train the neural network I can I

712
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:44,680
take that you trained it with this

713
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:46,990
specific number of sources oh thank you

714
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:50,770
very much for your question fortunately

715
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:52,330
I have time to answer it in full so you

716
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,670
were all the time talking about a

717
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:56,650
generic attack by understanding that it

718
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:59,230
is for the several sources that

719
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:02,080
represents those characters with similar

720
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:04,660
clifford's well doesn't the source

721
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:07,150
doesn't really matter is not important

722
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:09,670
I'll tell you more about it basically

723
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:13,510
one of the interesting conclusions of

724
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:15,490
this part does it internally with the

725
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:20,020
people that I mentioned at the end of my

726
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:24,189
presentation so knowledge about tools

727
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:27,009
and library has advanced so much any

728
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:30,070
security research our professional can

729
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:34,240
easily use those libraries and tools in

730
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:38,020
his system this system but we did not

731
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,848
invent any specific network we invented

732
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:42,130
a technique which is known as stressful

733
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:43,900
learning in artificial intelligence

734
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:45,339
Sutherland is very sick to explain

735
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,339
imagine that there are a number of

736
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:52,210
algorithms that allow you to identify

737
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:57,490
table so to speak you may take that

738
00:48:52,210 --> 00:49:01,420
algorithm and specialize it so that for

739
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:05,520
each to identify a leg table neck for

740
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:07,839
you so just specialized knowledge

741
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,790
participative here we got an existing

742
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,009
model we made it a specific to our

743
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:15,580
environment and this mirror never tells

744
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:17,349
you how much two images look alike we

745
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,779
just don't go into the search we just

746
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:21,400
don't go into anything so this neural

747
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,130
network tells you the level of similar

748
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,380
between two images yes but images are

749
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:29,890
fonts I have fun when I tested that

750
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:31,720
where the O and the zero are identical

751
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:34,930
and whereas other fonts the O and the

752
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:37,000
zero do not look alike at all yes as I

753
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,740
said before in Unicode all the possible

754
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,380
combination of characters are reflected

755
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:48,009
and we swipe here will scan all that yes

756
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:49,990
but in under a long time ago the most

757
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:56,740
presentation precisely about that about

758
00:49:49,990 --> 00:50:03,339
replacing zeros and that are similar in

759
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:05,890
some fun discuss it later on but I don't

760
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,270
know whether I'm answering now but here

761
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,770
basically you're testing all the

762
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,890
possible combinations whereas in the

763
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:14,980
standard in the Unicode lock in the

764
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:18,160
specific case of this tool I've used

765
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:21,490
these Latin characters but we can't

766
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:24,609
discuss that later on but imagine

767
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:26,379
different examples so that here would be

768
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:29,110
just a similar thing

769
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:33,280
take these due to the correlation do

770
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:34,900
extract the similarities and I said so

771
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:40,570
thank you very much to have come very

772
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:45,180
fast through the source code you tested

773
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:50,200
the typical editors would you enter

774
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:53,740
source code no I didn't test that is

775
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,200
that not pat class class yes it is and

776
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,919
is that the way you view it yes that's

777
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,830
exactly it

778
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,290
so I come uploaded every part - you have

779
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:04,480
with completely fully false and

780
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,070
libraries looking like if I were doing

781
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,020
an import system I'm not going to

782
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:10,060
tolerate your code yeah you may upload

783
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:12,550
that but I don't know whether you will

784
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:14,380
visually see it in github no I'm not

785
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:17,830
saying indeed huh but if this works in

786
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,630
note pad plus plus look I just want to

787
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:21,490
correct it but if it we go back to the

788
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:24,940
dictionary you see this in bredesen yes

789
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:26,620
shows up in red this is what happens

790
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,660
well it does not identify character

791
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,490
these are the characters and okhla

792
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,220
notepad plus plus does not identify

793
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:34,118
anything which is not in red it is

794
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:39,609
identified

795
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:42,369
bye so I didn't test what you are

796
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:47,348
telling me but I could do it well do you

797
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:49,509
have a next thing to do now and now when

798
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:53,380
it comes to what now for those of you

799
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:55,599
who edit code when editing well surely

800
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,819
you will notice that you see the package

801
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,890
you will enter the package who would

802
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:01,210
analyze it you will researches you will

803
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:03,879
see that there is something wrong this

804
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:05,019
is an example of how you can use this

805
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,240
tool in other scenarios

806
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:10,990
what about malware I'm thinking about

807
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:14,740
very many vectors all right thank you

808
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:21,578
very much is that last question yes

809
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:24,220
there is one that sums of Defense magic

810
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:25,960
that we received you have a list of all

811
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:28,019
the domain for instance on fruited and

812
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:34,559
then you go and detect that you have

813
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:38,649
register and malicious domain so domain

814
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:42,930
providers can if they carry notification

815
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:46,410
if you report that to domain brightest

816
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:49,328
registrate errs would they do anything

817
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:51,670
to fix it but the good thing about this

818
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:55,809
tool is that it will show you all the

819
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:58,150
options so if you don't know the - later

820
00:52:55,809 --> 00:53:01,450
on you will see that the tool comes in

821
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:07,619
readable format and then it goes into

822
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:11,618
Unicode format most of the registers and

823
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:13,779
register it in Unicode format when I

824
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:19,210
executed it which was at the end of

825
00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:21,910
February so nowadays it status massively

826
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:23,619
so no Jenny attacks but now when you

827
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:27,279
have too soon you can't defend yourself

828
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:29,289
because you have the 307 name problem is

829
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:30,880
that you have the Unicode domain

830
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,920
someone may try to say it if that

831
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,259
happens you would report it and then

832
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,900
additionally if you register it yourself

833
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:40,599
which is easier to register Unicode you

834
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,999
may use some of the scenarios register

835
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:44,890
before signal telegram and others so

836
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:45,379
that someone would click on it thinking

837
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,270
that

838
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,730
it is legit and then it would be your

839
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:52,810
domain that you registered in Unicode in

840
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:56,890
I feel that you can report that to the

841
00:53:52,810 --> 00:54:04,549
provider and then the provider all the

842
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:08,299
register will take action here there are

843
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:10,820
very many security services providers

844
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,410
and there are many individuals providing

845
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:18,770
services to me

846
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:22,100
specifically they are sitting in row two

847
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:25,730
and you are cutting in the browser proxy

848
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:28,069
all deep domains as my company yes he

849
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:32,330
got really angry the other day because I

850
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:35,090
sent him a list of domains in Ferrovial

851
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:38,920
they were like nearly 8000 so thank you

852
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:38,920
very much Alfonzo and thank you everyone
