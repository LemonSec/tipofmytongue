1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:10,500
yes thanks first of all I would like to

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,320
congratulate rooted for its 10th

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,009
anniversary and the celebration of these

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,439
sort of bunch benchmark event in our

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,210
sector having said that what I was going

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:27,090
to talk about we're going to talk about

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:29,130
social talk about the capabilities that

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,590
were given by the analysis of our social

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,870
networks we're going to try to see how

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,239
this applies in the real world and then

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,910
we will try to see with some examples

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:46,500
whether it works a life with things that

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:52,769
can be done I need to move on to the

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:58,230
next slide a quick presentation or

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:05,300
introduction I'm sure some of you here

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:05,300
know I started in cybersecurity in

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:24,750
hardness is responsible of the cyber

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:29,130
intelligence area an expert in the

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:33,979
layers then he's going to contribute to

20
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,329
talk about I think it is vital to

21
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:38,610
discuss the concepts we're going to

22
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,869
explain to give it a bit of context of

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,840
what we're going to be talking about

24
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,240
because there are some myths or things

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,740
that are often misinterpreted and we

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,149
want to define very briefly sort of the

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,220
general picture

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:59,730
first of all when we talk about social

29
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:04,600
networks if we ask any of us what is

30
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:08,500
that come to mind would be twitter

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:12,760
facebook Instagram these platforms of

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:17,410
massive used but really these are social

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:20,620
networks and those of us who are of a

34
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,650
certain age are clearing about this

35
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,130
social networks are human interactions

36
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:32,290
is what the person who the people you

37
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:36,340
went out to have a bite or go to the

38
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:38,650
movies or playing with your friends is

39
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:47,500
our social networks that then purchase

40
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:53,740
the throne time but I'm fourteen nature

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:57,100
and interpret social networks house like

42
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:00,100
this what we tend to see is this and

43
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,590
this is not just three majors but these

44
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:07,030
are very common pictures at restaurant

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:09,630
at restaurants or anywhere else and what

46
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,630
is the problem

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:22,719
sorry I need a bit of water the problem

48
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,390
is that the best friends nowadays are

49
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,060
those that you haven't even met and that

50
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:32,040
is a problem that somebody can benefit

51
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,040
for anybody in the following way

52
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,720
having got here at Ozma candy I said we

53
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,769
can make a difference between well first

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,000
of all the things to retentive or

55
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,070
bringing me and the organization for

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,190
inviting us so we can see that on the

57
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,739
one hand we have social networks in the

58
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,570
physical and the virtual level and they

59
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,650
overlap at so important on the other

60
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:06,940
hand we have social media which are

61
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,710
traditionally yes and in fact there's

62
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,270
one of the things that was a very

63
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:15,370
beginning if you use you may use

64
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:18,970
interchangeably social media social

65
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,420
networks when actually they have very

66
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,850
different context what is social media

67
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,530
and what are social networks when we

68
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,290
talk about social media we're talking

69
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,809
about online platform communication

70
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,900
platforms in the case of Twitter

71
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,240
Facebook Instagram all of these but also

72
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:42,099
not just the platforms but also the

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,470
content in the case of social networks

74
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,410
we're talking about relationships we're

75
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:51,550
talking about contact who publishes what

76
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:56,200
who relates with whom who says what and

77
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:59,560
for how long and what the degree or the

78
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,840
frequency of content of contact and in

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,770
fact one of the key factors of social

80
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,690
networks is the influencer power and we

81
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,560
will discuss that later on with candles

82
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:13,900
which are the what is the intention that

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:19,720
somebody may have to manipulate the

84
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:23,508
environment of a user like this user we

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:31,680
have here a group of friends and we want

86
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:34,159
which specific user to work and these

87
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,190
pictures also very interesting because

88
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:42,690
through social networks we look for

89
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:45,120
approval we look for friends and that is

90
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:48,379
great but on the other hand somebody can

91
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,460
benefit only users data for the wrong

92
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:52,979
what's interesting for us when we

93
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,979
analyze social networks is to get to

94
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:58,560
know the environment and the context if

95
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:00,508
we want to approach a goal we don't go

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,639
straight to that person or that we

97
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:11,729
probably approach first a friend or a

98
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:15,210
family member and in fact we have a fire

99
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,550
the perception is very different what we

100
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:21,330
believe people see from answers from

101
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:25,590
what they usually see we believe that we

102
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:28,620
look just great and it's and it's it can

103
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,739
be completely different in fact it's

104
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,529
very much connected with a with ego and

105
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,380
aneurysm and the desire to be the best

106
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:41,310
the most popular we believe that

107
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:45,180
anything that we publish everybody is

108
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,310
just expecting to see what we see and

109
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,110
how we react and that is a problem

110
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:54,990
because we've discussed it already that

111
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:58,889
people may actually test one to use that

112
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,650
information that situation to to use it

113
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,080
as an approach technique for the time

114
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,500
that I profile if I want to have me

115
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,789
inference on characters I can set up a

116
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:15,960
profile where I express ideas completely

117
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:20,310
different from the ones he has and you

118
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:24,568
can say that's counterproductive but we

119
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,830
face a profile I by showing this but I

120
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,889
can actually have to a profile

121
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,539
when I expressed complete opposite

122
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,300
apologize and another one when I

123
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:36,550
approached his ideas and his discourse

124
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,080
and when I have those two users

125
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,979
I can play muse both play with both to

126
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:50,740
obtain his trust

127
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:53,378
yes one of the techniques that we want

128
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,680
to reach a call we want to approach

129
00:07:53,379 --> 00:08:00,460
somebody at some point probably you will

130
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,099
have found that for no reason so from

131
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,830
that word you may receive an attack or

132
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:08,080
negative comment that you don't know

133
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,219
that didn't know and very often that

134
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,258
happens because if I am a and I want to

135
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:16,960
approach me and I don't know how to do

136
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,150
it because depending on the capacities

137
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,219
of technique of time he would use

138
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,549
different techniques and one possibility

139
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:25,900
is to set up different profiles to

140
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,419
approach him and out of the three

141
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,549
profiles I have to I'm going to use to

142
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:33,338
attack him in social networks I'm going

143
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:37,149
to criticize him and when he tries to

144
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:39,820
defend himself unless he is the typical

145
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:42,370
guy who blocks the people away

146
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:48,520
I can appear the defending him and

147
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:50,980
therefore we set up a link and then in a

148
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:57,459
private conversation he can perhaps

149
00:08:50,980 --> 00:09:00,910
thank me for the family name etc this

150
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:03,550
looks like it's a very activation but it

151
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:06,399
actually happens quite often so very

152
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,229
careful with those who believe who we

153
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,810
believe are our friends because they may

154
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:17,500
actually want in something against us a

155
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,869
to their advantage okay some statistics

156
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,680
there are over four billion users in

157
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,380
Internet and out of and more than 80%

158
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,290
are active users of social networks and

159
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,470
so there are many users connected and

160
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,899
many users that use social networks but

161
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,420
only we use social networks but we use

162
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,990
them

163
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:42,170
in a massive way another very important

164
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,580
figure out of the 10 websites that are

165
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:49,569
used more often

166
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:54,490
except for google adapted the russian

167
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:57,260
engine search engine we find twitter

168
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,480
facebook instagram these are just social

169
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,450
network so there's really a lot of

170
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:09,920
interest we spend pretty much all day

171
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:16,070
long horn videos don't skip it it's also

172
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:23,839
a graffiti it's also there between the

173
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:28,310
top 10 products but what happens if

174
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:32,000
social networks I happen become like the

175
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:37,130
place for compassion where we express

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,810
our sorrows and our choice but as we've

177
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:44,180
said on the one hand we want somebody

178
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,130
who listen to us but we don't know who

179
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,010
is out there listening to us and they

180
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:53,270
may actually use that moment of weakness

181
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:58,490
because probably when we are expressing

182
00:10:53,270 --> 00:11:03,800
joy this is probably done publicly but

183
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:05,330
when we there ourselves we probably do

184
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,420
that in a more intimate environment

185
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:11,240
perhaps we're at home and in that type

186
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:17,589
of environment we do not see any danger

187
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:21,170
and therefore we can express ourselves a

188
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:23,630
sort of more frankly more sincerely and

189
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,120
say things that we want we wouldn't say

190
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,610
in public but that message I can get

191
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,570
anywhere and people can use it against

192
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:35,960
us and of course we're always striving

193
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:39,560
for the likes this is an example that I

194
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,630
think shows very well the use that we

195
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,180
make of social networks in the case of

196
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,800
Twitter this is a

197
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:51,729
an example of of terrorists attacking

198
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,790
stress work and somebody says I've just

199
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:59,890
I'm in the middle of shooting the center

200
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:05,829
of Strasbourg and I've I'm in the cellar

201
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:08,110
of a restaurant so you're a terrorist

202
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,480
attack and you mention of this in

203
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,130
Twitter you don't you not only imagine

204
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,490
that that you're there you could just

205
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:18,310
say I'm I'm okay but you're saying I am

206
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:23,100
with 50 people if you want to do even

207
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:25,900
more damage come here I've never seen

208
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,510
messages in the case of the Paris a

209
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:32,020
terrorist attack in November 2015 where

210
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:36,040
they actually said I remember at the

211
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:39,280
time I was monitoring so from that

212
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,610
person and there were users that were

213
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:48,069
saying we're hiding in this street

214
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:50,770
number 11 and we are with so-and-so so

215
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:53,440
you have to think social networks are

216
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,949
okay to to communicate the social lives

217
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,020
but you should actually be careful with

218
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,640
what you say because yes in this

219
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,470
particular case this is these are

220
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,449
extremes but it's particularly relevant

221
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,290
how we use social networks to

222
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,890
dissimulate

223
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:11,170
any type of contact in this case he is

224
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,120
after the light just by mentioning that

225
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,490
he is in the middle of the shooting of

226
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,530
the tourist attacked so social networks

227
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,600
have a good side and a bad side and the

228
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:23,829
bad side can be used by the good guys or

229
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:33,010
the bad guys so after this short

230
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:35,740
introduction spare some demos so having

231
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,870
established the difference between

232
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,950
social networks and social media of

233
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:44,350
course we're talking about social social

234
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,960
networks and virtual social networks and

235
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,410
it's not the same

236
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,570
social network is really much wider than

237
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:54,060
just a virtual social networks and now

238
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,410
we're going to talk about none there's

239
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,869
real social networks when we talk about

240
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:02,100
social networks everybody does that

241
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,870
study politicians a company's good guys

242
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,000
bad guys because you can get plenty of

243
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,730
information and if that information as

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,950
we shall see now you overlap it with

245
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,440
information we publish it can be very

246
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:18,180
interesting

247
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:19,710
when we do a social network analysis of

248
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,620
our structure the first thing we have to

249
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:25,530
do is to know which type of structure

250
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,780
were facing first of all to know whether

251
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,880
we know this is a formal or informal

252
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,579
structure and we will see what how

253
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,830
they're different because when we do

254
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,830
this type of analysis what we're after

255
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:40,500
is to get to know how it is and then see

256
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,870
what's the goal or who are we going to

257
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,780
investigate or research there are many

258
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,240
types of networks you can see a bunch of

259
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,130
example here's we have two but what's

260
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,860
crucial is the difference between formal

261
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,510
and informal let's see an example this

262
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,730
is a formal structure within this

263
00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:00,600
structure this is this could be a

264
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,930
company or it can be an organization

265
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,930
such as

266
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,200
of whatever retina Network type if we

267
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,210
decide for whatever reason that we want

268
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,220
to approach presenting because we think

269
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:17,720
is a relevant position in that

270
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:21,580
organization and we want to acquire

271
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,950
relevant data if I wanted to think who

272
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,840
could can I approach because I I have

273
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:30,320
time and I don't want to go straight

274
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:33,110
away to him I would guess he won't make

275
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,120
sense to to approach somebody in the

276
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,250
board of directors because they would

277
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,520
seem to be closer to them so it might be

278
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:43,580
easier to approach one of them before

279
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,310
tackling Basanti this will be a formal

280
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,860
structure but if we move on to the

281
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,810
informal structure this is the same

282
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,420
hierarchical structure of a company

283
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,880
what is the informal structure like

284
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,550
because in parallel the formal structure

285
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,980
we also have an informal structure that

286
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,140
will be due to friendships and

287
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,540
interpersonal relationship within the

288
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:10,310
company or any organizations or we can

289
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:14,000
see that be invented as here and we

290
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:16,550
should think that he should be at the

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,530
center but no he is yeah it's enough at

292
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:24,430
the border he said the sort of outside

293
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:28,370
and if we think who should we approach

294
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:30,319
to then can access to rule we can't

295
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,510
there well we see that we have two

296
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,820
approaches and the rules are saying as

297
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,590
Annie was right there at the bottom so

298
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,960
initially we wouldn't have considered

299
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:43,210
him as a way to approach with anything

300
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:46,700
so if you don't do the informal analysis

301
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:49,040
of the relationship as well as they form

302
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,410
one in overlapping information from the

303
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,270
social networks this this type of

304
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:59,569
approach wouldn't have worked an example

305
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:03,269
of this type of approach to profiles we

306
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:07,529
can also find in a very classic example

307
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:10,109
which is fraught of the CEO first of all

308
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:15,569
you have to know which is their formal

309
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:17,490
structure of the structure you have to

310
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,500
study the informal structure and getting

311
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,679
information from social networks to know

312
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,529
at the point in time when the gentleman

313
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,569
who's going to make the payment order is

314
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:29,390
going to be out of reach because they're

315
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,730
travelling or whatever and then you can

316
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:37,289
replace them and and make the payment

317
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,940
request this would be like what happened

318
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,490
in the Minister of Defense I guess

319
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,760
you're all familiar with the crisis that

320
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:48,990
has been reported in the media because

321
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,850
of the intrusion of the Ministry of the

322
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,299
fairest network and this would be the

323
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:56,850
case because it's if I'm not if I'm from

324
00:17:54,299 --> 00:18:00,360
what I've read in the papers it seems it

325
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:05,908
would seem that it had been done through

326
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:08,549
a fishing through some low-level user

327
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:12,390
with a profile that's quite low level

328
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:14,240
and probably what they did was to

329
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,010
analyze their formal and informal

330
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,520
structure to know that that was the

331
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:23,399
chosen the user the one with which they

332
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,120
would have more probably the exercise so

333
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:29,850
I could be an example yes it was if it

334
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,139
was directed at time the targeted attack

335
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:38,520
them it was a good strategy so we find

336
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:42,720
the space which are the virtual networks

337
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:45,059
and there and then the social networks

338
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,799
and in the overlapping their social

339
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,379
media analysis and the social networks

340
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,168
the overlapping surface is very

341
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,510
important to get information that once

342
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:57,630
we process gives us very valuable

343
00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:01,429
intelligence and why

344
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:05,510
because we are social animals we like to

345
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:08,700
socialize and share have have friends

346
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:11,990
think that we have influence in the

347
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:15,000
networks and that makes us very easily

348
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:17,490
very easy to manipulate if we get

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,860
together Diego we had with the likes and

350
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:27,179
the information that we publish we are

351
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:30,600
really very life probable victims we

352
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:33,630
have the the because we have this

353
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,389
physical and virtual networks that

354
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:43,140
overlap and that generates a lot of very

355
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:46,409
relevant information going back to what

356
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,990
I had said at the beginning it would

357
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:51,870
that's what doesn't happen in social

358
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,940
media doesn't happen it's like the prior

359
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:59,879
presentation that was very interesting a

360
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:02,549
very dynamic and we've seen it most of

361
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,799
us have seen most of the failures have

362
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:07,289
good very well identified with the

363
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,830
comments but there was one journalist

364
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:18,510
and in this case journalists use a la

365
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:20,309
social network because our users

366
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,610
themselves that I provide that

367
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:25,530
information well intelligent you know

368
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,918
known social media will be based in that

369
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:32,100
on publishing content where we will see

370
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,169
the different types of content content

371
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,299
that is published and how it can be used

372
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:38,700
on the other hand their relationship

373
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,500
between these people that are producing

374
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,750
this content we will talk about virtual

375
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,330
communities and how there could be a

376
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:49,159
shared interest between different users

377
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,158
and how that can be detected

378
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:59,708
and use the Lafayette so very quickly

379
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:02,950
what happens in what in 20 60 seconds in

380
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:04,989
internet in social media what happens is

381
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:10,019
everything that you see here in the

382
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:14,139
slide over 1 million logins to Facebook

383
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:16,509
19,000 publications in Twitter so a huge

384
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:20,049
amount of information were very active

385
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:22,899
over 80% of users are active users of

386
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:25,089
social networks and we are very active

387
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:28,059
and we not only use them but if we use

388
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:29,708
them a lot and what's the content what

389
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:32,889
is the content that's interesting to

390
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:35,589
analyze weathers day there's everything

391
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:38,379
really because sometimes when we think

392
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:40,958
if we ask what type of information do

393
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:44,168
you believe that can be relevant for

394
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:48,609
research or for an investigation many of

395
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:51,279
you here the text that is published for

396
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:54,129
instance we in Twitter that the message

397
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:59,109
parents the picture instagrammed a video

398
00:21:54,129 --> 00:22:01,539
an audio file these sort of things but

399
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:05,019
there is information that we do not

400
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:09,759
control where we depend from a third

401
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:12,219
party for instance from the type of

402
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:16,359
information that we use to publish it

403
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:19,209
with we cannot remove that and people

404
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,968
can know whenever using iPhone Android

405
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:24,909
Blackberry iPad and then there is

406
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:27,099
information about the date/time our user

407
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:29,289
ID there's a lot of information and

408
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:31,979
everything is relevant everything is of

409
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:36,190
interest for an investigation or

410
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:39,759
research so do not think only about what

411
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:41,320
you say but when we say to whom we say

412
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,919
it all of that information is useful

413
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,379
what we're doing in Isis so we're going

414
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,979
to try to make the first of the

415
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,978
direction

416
00:22:51,610 --> 00:23:04,820
Carlos and I like risk I can I'll call

417
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:06,950
him to the borders to the limit so we're

418
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,740
going to do it life and what we're going

419
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:15,680
to do is connected to water has come out

420
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:17,690
in the previous presentation there's

421
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,850
been a comment about the fact that

422
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:25,580
somebody devoted time to identify which

423
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:28,459
appeared in what film these are things

424
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:32,199
that can now be done automatically one

425
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,520
example this is say particularly because

426
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:39,260
what we think is going to show right now

427
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:43,250
is useful because when you try to

428
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:48,140
identify visual communities that we want

429
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:52,730
to analyze we will not only use what

430
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:56,330
they say or who says it but also which

431
00:23:52,730 --> 00:24:00,980
device they use and how they use it and

432
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:04,909
what they say within that medium and one

433
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:07,340
personal perhaps can vary their way over

434
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,650
to the talk depending on the network

435
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:13,429
that yourself so it can be relevant how

436
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:15,650
many people are behind digit identity or

437
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:19,700
a tutor account a lot of matters of

438
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:22,100
interest so this is a great explanation

439
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,400
that we have developed specifically for

440
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,669
this conference and what we're going to

441
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,670
do

442
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:38,070
I have different videos and we're gonna

443
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:41,629
do tests and see if this works we're

444
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,629
gonna upload this video

445
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,049
[Music]

446
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:05,840
this is a program perhaps many of you

447
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:09,530
won't know it because it's a TV 3 the

448
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,199
program is a new program it's started

449
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,780
recently and I've been important to be

450
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,700
able to collaborate in that program here

451
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,460
to see what we can do in an automatic

452
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,289
way in the one heart I've uploaded the

453
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:26,679
video and what we're going to do this

454
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:29,450
imagine we are a company where we will

455
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:34,250
you check on the brand of our company

456
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:42,230
and we being published on a social

457
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:44,780
network so online real-time so we'll do

458
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:49,610
a search of phenomenon for words that up

459
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:53,149
here or may appear in a video so we are

460
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:55,309
recovering many videos and want to do a

461
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:58,250
search and in this case we will include

462
00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:01,149
words that we know are going to appear

463
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:05,539
but the approach is that you can monitor

464
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:08,150
any type of network of content where we

465
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:11,289
want to check whether there is a

466
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:13,929
reference to our brand or somebody

467
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:17,629
appears that can be of interest for our

468
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:20,929
research being to act proactively or

469
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:23,740
just to increase our knowledge about a

470
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:23,740
brand or

471
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:29,940
so we have captured many videos and we

472
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,700
want to search in this case because it

473
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:36,570
would be doing a search by the name of

474
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,170
one person and an expression that may or

475
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,169
may not come up

476
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:45,499
vamos become sort of that but then even

477
00:26:43,189 --> 00:26:48,879
a warp another line so we'll know who's

478
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:48,879
merciful deep in the body

479
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:18,050
this is just a wall so you can really

480
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:21,710
tell that this is her demo otherwise so

481
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:23,659
we want to detect which terms or names

482
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:26,870
of people that may come up in a

483
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:29,930
multimedia content and in this case or

484
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:35,899
using a video and you will see how it

485
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:43,340
can detect how these terms they come up

486
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:48,850
in that video in that content so now it

487
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:51,350
is analyzing the video and using

488
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:53,449
artificial intelligence to interpret

489
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:57,709
what's being said in the video in as

490
00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:01,990
soon as they content that we've art that

491
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,990
were after it should let us know

492
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,930
yesterday night it was working

493
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:17,790
we are here connected with our own

494
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,939
servers how the connection is not the

495
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,899
right one there's not the real

496
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:28,890
environment and that's why it's going

497
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:34,160
quite slow so now I need to then we'll

498
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:36,690
see what happens we've tried to look for

499
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:41,040
examples with different moments of the

500
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:44,600
media that I thought were relevant on

501
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,600
the one hand the first word

502
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,040
no bachelor party videos the ATM

503
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:09,580
maybe I have to move on to the next

504
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:11,650
video MC if we're lucky there we're

505
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:17,760
gonna try bond with another one in this

506
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:17,760
case this for the video of a program and

507
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:38,590
representing contra de nuestras we're

508
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:44,050
against a some of our people who were

509
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:50,470
not at all hot nothing so there are some

510
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:53,159
very violent scene is here the original

511
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:57,030
videos that yeah

512
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,030
uncensored okay

513
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:13,520
so we are part of the security forces

514
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:17,180
and we want to see if there's a

515
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,820
reference to review the to the palace

516
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:28,040
security forces the work that may be or

517
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:34,010
to a specific people in this case you're

518
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:37,790
looking for a final because I was a

519
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:40,550
reference to him in the tweet important

520
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,889
because this was a video that had been

521
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:46,790
put together with different terrorist

522
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:49,370
attack in different cities and in Verona

523
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,950
was very prominent and there was the

524
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:56,479
video was most of the most of it in

525
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:59,600
Spanish and there was this seem to have

526
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,690
quite a lot of knowledge about the

527
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,610
location because of the Twitter messages

528
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,210
that have been published in Spanish and

529
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:10,490
because of references to specific people

530
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:14,570
the the interesting bit here in this

531
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:16,580
approach is an arrival without needing

532
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:19,100
to watch other content because we're

533
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,830
just saying that I hear some people are

534
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,320
beheaded and there are some really gory

535
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,480
scenes see so the analyst students see

536
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,530
need to see these contents it should

537
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,900
just be some kind of whistleblower or

538
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:37,360
you can set the people you want to

539
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,360
monitor control if you want you know

540
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,330
if you want to see something awkward

541
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,730
some mansions

542
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:50,189
Zoid or what if you yield was an onerous

543
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:52,860
paying nothing you get a warning - okay

544
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,929
the main location source to the

545
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,780
investigation on to block on social

546
00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:00,330
media of that is being disseminated in

547
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,160
the civil guard for example they were

548
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,909
looking for the pants were the speaker

549
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:09,240
is mentioned as what a soy de Barcelona

550
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:12,710
could eat that much without needing to

551
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,710
pluck without needing to play the video

552
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,330
this is quite interesting now as we were

553
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,600
saying at the beginning if we

554
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:25,429
assassinate but a certain point it's

555
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,469
full of happened in the case of Basanti

556
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,900
or a senior you're investigating our

557
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,740
target that is good for you that in fact

558
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,780
is not good

559
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,270
I'm going to research another one if

560
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,920
they're monitoring the whole network

561
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:39,610
even though there are no focused on the

562
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,610
second objective

563
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:50,419
so we'll know who's but also forgiving

564
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,420
about it yeah

565
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,099
[Music]

566
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:16,649
what you think until it can stop little

567
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:18,479
until the stars have your boy for

568
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:22,189
everything is this how you usually talk

569
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:22,190
to a girl when you first met her

570
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,709
well as you can see on the video if

571
00:33:28,889 --> 00:33:36,869
someone was talking about about the

572
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:38,609
wrong TV channel blame Apple user may

573
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:45,928
identify that they're watching a certain

574
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:49,289
TV channel in particular particular

575
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:53,879
stake I saw was por ejemplo congregated

576
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:57,169
talapus a Geordie case LLL % adore this

577
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:57,168
guy's jewelry for example

578
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:05,740
like a bit of orange on the door it says

579
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:08,949
100% electric you can check in which

580
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:12,280
second disappears and there are more

581
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:17,969
later if you see I and as I was saying

582
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:21,610
earlier so this is a code in this frame

583
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:24,668
is very down but this is the loveless

584
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:28,780
drum screen it and we can see we were

585
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:36,429
thread so here the power is quite

586
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:39,149
interesting and last last video he's

587
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,149
also quite relevant

588
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and is yet another video from another

589
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:58,020
part of the former fool or six minute

590
00:34:48,000 --> 00:35:02,940
video from jihad channel I'm gonna look

591
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:18,630
for empanada with cheese they the police

592
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:21,450
of the city of our salvation from mentos

593
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,460
the video some videos pyramid so these

594
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:25,020
fragments are from videos that have been

595
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,590
published in jihadist channels

596
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:30,450
mentioning all the time is paying that's

597
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:33,740
why it's interesting to monitor them and

598
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,740
to use these kind of tools

599
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,069
to be proactive when it comes to

600
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:42,609
protecting this continent even though

601
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:44,950
our bridge beating myself but my

602
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:49,930
watching the video we wouldn't have to

603
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:52,689
defy this do you Terence yesterday we

604
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:56,220
were accessing videos and we will see

605
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:59,710
some more towns and one of the

606
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:05,288
firefighters in the video if I just have

607
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:09,910
a label belt level with a 913 ID and

608
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:12,970
that could be detailed you barely see

609
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:17,140
but it is moving and the library signing

610
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:19,680
the application the testator tell that

611
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:24,690
person without ID was there at that time

612
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,690
he were looking forever guard

613
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:34,060
you see this you can't really see it

614
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:37,390
well but when we have this involve

615
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:39,578
clothes run were looking for I will look

616
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,549
at me via video we may believe the

617
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:43,780
ground over TV another be so long even

618
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,280
other media is talking about a mother

619
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,720
brand or maybe they will modify the

620
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,660
video and they have a negative message

621
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:54,189
but see these are the things that we can

622
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:57,640
actually attempt will be young down to

623
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:00,870
finish Carlos how do you you notice in

624
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:06,279
the video who appears

irrelevant people the king of Spain the

627
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:20,990
former Spanish president Rahul Khanna is

628

Buju them on the forward and compressing

629
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:26,839
tell everybody

630
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,940
Catalonia regional government and we can

631
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:36,319
actually identify who appears in these

632
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:37,849
videos that we facial recognition so we

633
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:42,500
can do something as powerful as the

634
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:44,390
following look for the word Phillip the

635
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,279
sixth give the name of the king

636
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:51,348
you know if we can see whether this is

637
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:59,410
attempted say that we're doing

638
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:59,410
surveillance someone watch videos

639
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:09,750
and we're interested in seeing something

640
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:12,270
in particular this case will ingest

641
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:15,150
acknowledged that we recognize our

642
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:18,660
because we saw the word Felipe volcanoes

643
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:22,020
and because there was facial recognition

644
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:29,100
of all people here and one of them is it

645
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:32,820
Englishman so this is an example of the

646
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:34,589
power can thereby plan destiny avoiding

647
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,950
for having any to visualize all of

648
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:41,070
content because it would be unfeasible

649
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:43,790
to cite all the contents published on

650
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,790
social media

651
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,830
he as we were saying before doesn't

652
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,060
appear but we have the bit the picture

653
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,990
of the person interesting for the

654
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,990
investigation

655
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:16,040
well my is las posibilidades que tiene

656
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,690
esta pasando so near sunny minutes as

657
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,490
well we are you have seen the

658
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:22,160
possibility of these which are quite big

659
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:24,859
I'm gonna speed up because we're getting

660
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,299
out of time so what do we need a social

661
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:32,660
media now is is for mainly to discover

662
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,670
patterns this is we have a structure of

663
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:38,509
hundreds of thousands of individuals or

664
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:40,520
entities as we will see now why is this

665
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,550
interesting well to identify the most

666
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,380
important stakeholders and together

667
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,630
features of that kind of network and to

668
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,850
know how many to interact with it and to

669
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,100
get to know each role and for each

670
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:54,920
individually network and to attend

671
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:59,540
groups and subgroups within the actual

672
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:02,060
network and houses are all the basis is

673
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:06,220
very powerful mathematically speaking in

674
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,220
explain this but briefly

675
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,430
we were sitting nanny network made up

676
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:19,359
like now aleeah's who knows he's a

677
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:21,040
smallest entity of a network in here by

678
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,540
looking at a node they may not only

679
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:29,259
hearing and read each nursery will be

680
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:32,800
connected by lines or edges which would

681
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:38,800
be the connection system and each node

682
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:40,750
has a degree that is a number of nodes

683
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,560
with which it is connected and why is

684
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,880
this I would think we talk about a node

685
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,490
we don't care about the type of entity

686
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,359
it is it could be a person IP address or

687
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:54,399
domain you tell and there are any sort

688
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:57,480
of information that we want to associate

689
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,480
with his interesting

690
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:06,110
okay let's look at an example this be

691
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,109
more real

692
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:12,800
nobody had people battery back so we

693
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:15,940
have more demos prepared but hopefully

694
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,940
we'll be able to visualize them

695
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,049
well initially should be okay

696
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,759
let's see

697
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:49,700
well ideally here could be any of us and

698
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:54,099
we any sort of entity may have any sort

699
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:57,439
of information were a friend a vehicle a

700
00:41:54,099 --> 00:42:01,369
spouse and a building of these kind of

701
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:05,049
information we'll see what we can do

702
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:05,049
let's see whether we can come back

703
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:24,860
thank God we didn't bring more laptops

704
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,860
Carlos let's see whether it works now

705
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:31,500
knows you buy a store you're not a

706
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:34,380
phenol ok so much so we get to this

707
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,380
actually now if we imagine that each of

708
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,770
these he saw us with our form

709
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,990
relationships we get an example of the

710
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,550
massive volume of information that will

711
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,200
allow Tom inaudible that could be

712
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:50,030
available for example in failure on

713
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:55,830
Facebook if you make an example between

714
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:58,530
two million users two random users among

715
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:04,620
them that will only be four leaves of

716
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:06,360
people and what happens all these data

717
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,950
information that we're publishing and

718
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,840
not just used by unique companies

719
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:12,540
they're also used by the good guys in

720
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:15,720
bar and the bargain is how with him from

721
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:17,970
its operations what is that to change

722
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:22,740
the behavior of a target audience to

723
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:24,509
alter their behavior example of this may

724
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:27,899
be seeing the latest American

725
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:30,380
connections after the influence and his

726
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,380
drone campaign

727
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:38,170
to influence certain group and

728
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:40,990
polarizing the behaviors depending on

729
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:46,390
the specific matter of the messages they

730
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:48,089
manage to take around elections to give

731
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:51,129
an example

732
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:52,770
whilst we have a network which you know

733
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,270
it can be armed

734
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:58,509
well it will depend on go we mentioned

735
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:01,150
earlier the target because if I wanted

736
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:04,089
to disable this network I probably want

737
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:07,839
to end up with a dial or a glasses

738
00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:09,069
because I'm a busy in network if I want

739
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,650
to have influence on the network

740
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:13,029
although to his lady who may have of an

741
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:16,780
influence on the element so it's very

742
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:21,650
important to number one and this is an

743
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:29,170
example of a part of a new structure

744
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:32,059
most elegant community here we have

745
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:35,710
resources and network analysis and here

746
00:44:32,059 --> 00:44:37,910
we need to attack them a nervous here on

747
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,710
parking on these heaven knows we could

748
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:44,118
disable this whole network that

749
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:45,380
otherwise movie unfeasible of this is

750
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:47,150
not just by the Google gun is also

751
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:53,900
birthmark eyes and we'll give you

752
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:56,960
example example and these black teeth to

753
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:01,490
Oakwood mentioned earlier it's good to

754
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:04,990
get to know the use of profile when it

755
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:09,979
comes to having an influence what is

756
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:11,689
good to know was course as well as the

757
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,759
country's course may be interesting to

758
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:16,519
foster a message or attraction change it

759
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:19,210
to send a message or specific

760
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:19,209
advertising

761
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:29,040
let's say yeah we know they have certain

762
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:31,720
ideas we could try to change them from

763
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,200
Dario to radicalize a message maybe you

764
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,609
could foster it and talk to other people

765
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,819
maybe those people may have an

766
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:42,520
influential profile I will take others

767
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:45,460
to that objective for 2,000 years or

768
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,930
that approach you are looking at or in

769
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,460
the case of elections to try to go to a

770
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,000
certain person he just gave you an

771
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,520
example

772
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,520
usually a use different software for

773
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,440
that analysis but here and used this one

774
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:02,109
as an open-source version in case you're

775
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:06,700
interested in here directly from a file

776
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:10,830
we love with a series of information and

777
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:15,160
after a small investigation coming out

778
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:20,380
on Direction conflicts we detected as we

779
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:23,020
said a micro group within this volume of

780
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,540
messages and now we're gonna see how

781
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:28,710
they're structured so dung here was so

782
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,710
loud all the information

783
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:35,390
I'm going to fix this so we can view

784
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:35,390
better

785
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,290
and here in this case

786
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:55,820
can you see it well well here we can see

787
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,650
how from the databank it's what we had a

788
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,930
lot of information with energy

789
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,550
communications we can attack how there

790
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:04,640
were some profiles I initially seemed

791
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:08,060
independent but once assessed we could

792
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,830
see that it will be these profiles

793
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:13,340
actually these nerves that we see here

794
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:16,670
which other main inference nodes and how

795
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:21,790
the rival in this case through channel

796
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:24,310
12 profiles to have an influence on

797
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:28,160
elections

798
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:31,060
once in this information we decided to

799
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,060
research that way

800
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,549
and he so happened

801
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:51,390
that we found this series of profiles

802
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:04,520
who imagine these challenges we talk

803
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:08,990
about 15 profiles eventually the word

804
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:12,950
controlling a 30,000 accounts we can see

805
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:17,180
these profiles have simple features to

806
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:20,540
detect we relate the investigation first

807
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:22,460
of all they had many users five thousand

808
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,910
two thousand some of them have less

809
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:28,130
they're all located somewhere in Turkey

810
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:29,649
we cannot sit here with these are

811
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,590
Turkish populations of your heart

812
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:36,260
between two and seven fifths or more

813
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:43,010
they all use this URL either Google

814
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:48,380
switch on Facebook monitor them and

815
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:49,970
control them and also report them by the

816
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,920
way

817
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:55,129
it's not the future it's quite relevant

818
00:48:51,920 --> 00:49:00,799
which is a they are all being creative

819
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:03,920
but between example general this can be

820
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:07,640
obtained by assessing the information in

821
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,130
within a group we have very little time

822
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:15,520
just after I left the software can

823
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:15,520
detect communities within a larger group

824
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:24,349
this is used to investigate about guys

825
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:26,619
but also terrorists let's look for

826
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:26,619
another example

827
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:35,869
when I show here is analysis that was

828
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:39,859
done on the words of groups or they were

829
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:44,229
sharing content initially these were

830
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:44,229
channels that were independent

831
00:49:54,100 --> 00:50:00,730
and whoever controls this box who

832
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:03,610
actually is perfect news but alas they

833
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:11,770
can do come of these bonds know how that

834
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:19,000
sort of personality but tomorrow it

835
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:21,100
could be mystic extreme right people

836
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,500
could retreat or like without really

837
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:29,400
knowing what's going on with we can see

838
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:38,710
how these were some groups exist and

839
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:41,110
here we can zoom in observing how they

840
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:44,560
communicate if you assess information

841
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:46,690
you get the option of knowing to reach

842
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:49,180
now do we need to go to a sample I'm

843
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:56,300
ready the whole communication network of

844
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:58,040
jihadist propaganda so let us be done

845
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,600
regarding all these information from

846
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:04,550
these novels yeah but I think that

847
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:08,630
people can also attend here we found a

848
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:24,550
location from hackers and cyber

849
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:27,020
terrorists dies a few days ago they

850
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:29,540
announced a number of websites are

851
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:32,770
having to count one of them was Meridian

852
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:35,390
Brende for entrepreneurship in Madrid

853
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:37,520
this country's current size of the

854
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:39,920
website and these are example we

855
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,680
attempted to attack that we use with

856
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:46,550
technical profiles on Facebook the most

857
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:52,730
interesting bit so far is real we have

858
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:55,460
just mentioned we have seen virtual

859
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:59,000
communities static ones ok we see a

860
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:00,170
graph his life and the interesting

861
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,040
element is to see how they're created

862
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:06,040
formed and how they evolve so here

863
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,990
we're going to expand

864
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:19,720
how each big header here is like a

865
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:22,220
member of social network in this case

866
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,839
each beam me he has a publication of a

867
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:29,118
content and here on the Left we can see

868
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:32,869
the type of content they are sharing we

869
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:36,890
can also observe how little bit over the

870
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:39,710
network somehow created each user shares

871
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:41,509
we can see it days apart a little bit

872
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:43,040
he'll you can see how users are sharing

873
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:50,180
things and now we're gonna see a real

874
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:53,150
time example this area but anyway from

875
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:56,960
Oban save up can you see it well they're

876
00:52:53,150 --> 00:53:03,560
publishing content differently now so

877
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:05,510
being created to go to a specific date

878
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:10,570
and we can see from that it specific

879
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:12,470
date how things are developed it's

880
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:17,080
better to get a more visual

881
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:19,930
demonstration specific to follow profile

882
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:23,630
III tell telegram with this case

883
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:25,730
followed our profile so the vision we

884
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:28,190
can sell

885
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:29,720
or get an immoral information to

886
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:34,100
business intelligence because the graph

887
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:35,810
technology all the network analyses may

888
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,220
be useful to give knowledge and to have

889
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:39,680
information but on the other hand

890
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:42,049
they're also useful to sell to the seer

891
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,120
majors this information which is very

892
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:46,370
difficult to have you can see him but it

893
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,770
is bacala you might be easier to make it

894
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:51,319
on the central data point we could not

895
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:54,470
filter by content type by profile

896
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:57,790
so we're interesting symmetry your

897
00:53:54,470 --> 00:54:00,259
content is important not just to see the

898
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:02,600
information sources but also to have

899
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:04,550
tools that allow us to treat and process

900
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,670
our information in a way that allows us

901
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:09,650
to be easily changeable otherwise you

902
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,300
cannot generate other intelligence that

903
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:13,910
were looking for eventually to make

904
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:17,680
decisions such as carry on turn out an

905
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,680
operation or a certain movement

906
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:22,670
and well is the end of our presentation

907
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:25,819
we've done it really quickly

908
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:27,860
basically we want to to mention all of

909
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,540
this we do a provides for them so

910
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:32,920
quickly last part but we did have some

911
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,920
technical glitches thank you
