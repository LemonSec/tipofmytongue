00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:17,550

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:21,180
be used to we're gonna talk about the

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,369
technical considerations regarding data

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,980
protection it would happen in the car

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:34,230
selling independence referendum in 2017

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:35,630
so we're gonna talk about all this first

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,199
of all let's introduce ourselves

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:44,129
Thank You albarran thank you Brutus for

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:48,480
having us here I have a PhD in

12
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,789
constitutional law and I come from two

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,260
universities University of Lyon right

14
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,989
now I'm working at the University of

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,839
Vigo as a constitutional law teacher I

16
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,349
think that is most relevant thing I

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,660
could tell about me important guy is my

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,020
colleague here not really important I

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,259
think that you all know me I do a half I

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,298
don't have a PhD in ID by the

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,650
universities our grandson I work for the

22
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,500
Ministry of Defense and I do binary

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,860
analysis and security in conduct under

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,750
glass credit cards okay so first of all

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,640
before we begin because this is a bit

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,920
controversial

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,010
I think that you are all here to throw

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,010
eggs at us or to learn something right

29
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,780
so first of all there's a little

30
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,640
disclaimer within that everyone has a

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,190
right to participate in twirled feeling

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,310
a little referendum or something that no

33
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:56,399
one is above the laws and of course

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,980
within the referendum must have minimum

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,760
guarantees to be exactly internationally

36
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:06,510
as a legal referendum and here you have

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:11,400
a reference about a technical report of

38
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,930
a Venice committee talking about that

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,459
minimum set of rules that we could

40
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:22,740
expect but also like to thank people who

41
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:24,360
are not here remind people who are not

42
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,170
here the only mutable laws are the

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,690
physical laws of nature politicians need

44
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:34,738
to do their work which is to do politics

45
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:38,070
basically to change the laws without

46
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,440
committing any legality and here we can

47
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:44,519
see the legal point of view with regard

48
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,530
to this partial institution which is

49
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,570
valid legal tax in Spain

50
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,739
therefore we have a great doctor with

51
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,200
our Sabri PhD who in constitutional law

52
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,850
the first thing that you learn today is

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,560
quite interesting is not technical

54
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,560
because verse for sanitation

55
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,829
the first part will deal with the

56
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,510
Spanish Constitution and we're leaving

57
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,830
this painting now we have certain laws

58
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:18,269
states and constitutional laws that were

59
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:21,360
hard to get for our forefathers and we

60
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:26,220
should know about it I was doing this to

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:31,200
be honest talk about this with tomorrow

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:36,930
didn't present seven days loves I like

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,850
to highlight tomorrow that our

64
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,190
Constitution unlike the German

65
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,890
constitution for example maybe change

66
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:51,150
can found you know about that because

67
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:53,670
few years ago there was a change such as

68
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,050
a German one the half have been tangible

69
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,709
clauses that means of those

70
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:01,140
constitutions are or some way forever

71
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,390
pretty much however in numbers are

72
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,350
happening the Spanish Constitution

73
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:09,149
having said that this is your gender

74
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,620
after his presentation first tomorrow

75
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,840
will tell you about the Spanish

76
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,550
Constitution

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,280
you can sleep for about half an hour if

78
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,220
you wish and then we will tell you about

79
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,979
the critical conflict history and a

80
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,950
timeline what happened she talked about

81
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:30,480
the electoral sensors and they two

82
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:32,310
principles focus on the technical power

83
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,330
from the perspective of censorship and

84
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,330
anti censorship

85
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,510
to mention all the techniques used for

86
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,770
the October first referendum and then

87
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,180
tomorrow we'll talk about the legal

88
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,740
implications and then we'll give the

89
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,479
conditions okay so my then will be

90
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,199
trying to work out from Europe but

91
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,310
Ricardo was saying it might be important

92
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,090
to understand the basis of the

93
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:05,250
constitutional law to better understand

94
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:09,388
what happened on October 1st and where

95
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,970
we can begin this and were that conflict

96
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,280
led to however

97
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:19,710
so we begin with some data regarding our

98
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:22,080
Constitution system first enforcement of

99
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:27,510
our supreme norm as you might now we

100
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,520
came into force on December 29 1978 it's

101
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,760
important to remember that it was

102
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:37,440
ratified by the Spanish people on

103
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:39,330
December 6 1970 18 no referendum which

104
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,910
was participation in that referendum

105
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,060
well if we go to the whole of national

106
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,210
territory we have a preservation of

107
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,639
around 67 point one percent of the

108
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,388
electron temperature sensor studies of

109
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,810
people with Iraq develop from that

110
00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,559
percentage the federal both people who

111
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:06,699
voted positively to the Constitution

112
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:06,699
and is about eighty-seven point 78%

113
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:14,449
therefore that's a 58% of a vote with

114
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:17,269
Lavrov left or centrist if we go to

115
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:23,770
Catherine it's fear these percentages

116
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:26,440
are slightly higher more or less around

117
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:30,849
68% of Catalonian people went to vote

118
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,250
without referendum on 76 so showing our

119
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:35,400
support of around ninety point five

120
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:40,990
percent in favor of the Constitution

121
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:43,090
showing an approach of about or an

122
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,669
implicit involvement of our sixty sixty

123
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,758
one percent and we should take into

124
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:51,719
account there are constitutional text as

125
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:59,500
being influenced by other constitutions

126
00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:02,139
from the broad as we can see here from

127
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,479
German constitutionalism we have quite a

128
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,610
few things the actual constitutional

129
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,430
guarantee system and the Constitutional

130
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,669
Court which is quite important and I'm

131
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,169
sure that he sounds familiar

132
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:16,180
article one hundred fifty fifty-five and

133
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:18,039
the causative forever federalism

134
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,389
came from the mo Constitution and

135
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:24,880
regarding nature protection

136
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:28,000
the Portuguese influence is part

137
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,729
interesting in article 18 for the French

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,610
Constitution also gives us the organic

139
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:39,580
regulation leading to the approval of

140
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,860
the attitudes of the Tom P here we have

141
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,650
Mexico as well darling social rights

142
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:48,430
Italy with the principle of material

143
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:49,710
equality in article 19 of the Spanish

144
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,050
translation

145
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,758
what we look of a historical tradition

146
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:59,630
of Spain the biggest influence might

147
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:04,800
come from the republican constitution of

148
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:08,960
1931 in touch light it talks about

149
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,090
seventeen autonomous communities cannot

150
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,549
voluntarily principle and through these

151
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,919
two questions the seventeen trans

152
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,289
communities were created as well as the

153
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:23,490
two ensemble cities without too many

154
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:26,490
details if you actually say there are

155
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,289
two important ways to create an autonomy

156
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,710
we're not going to talk about particular

157
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:37,250
duties or the exceptions we have the

158
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:41,039
fast way of article 151 and one

159
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:45,830
transitory paragraph for over five and

160
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:48,550
then there's no way in section 143 and

161
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:51,310
48.2

162
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:54,130
that means that there's low a hard a

163
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:57,010
lower competent stop

164
00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:00,460
however the fast way will have a higher

165
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,930
competence guard competence gap and for

166
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,050
approving men are telling me they will

167
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,560
need a referendum of their project for a

168
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,849
yes at each of autonomy and what is the

169
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,369

170
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:17,440
well it is a basic rule of the

171
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,400
territorial entity of the autonomous

172
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:29,250
community it is an organic reward

173
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:31,990
specific special but and approved by the

174
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:36,970
Parliament Parliament of nation it is a

175
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:39,550
national law therefore and that's why

176
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:45,390
it's in a special position within the

177
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,390
pyramid we think the legal order

178
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,839
and the autonomous acquired with

179
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:58,209
approval of his own attitude of autonomy

180
00:09:52,839 --> 00:10:03,370
but let's go to other elements of

181
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:05,768
constitutional here we have a system of

182
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:09,329
comprehensive vision on matters our

183
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:12,310
Constitution listen is very a symmetric

184
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:15,310
and that is also transferred to the

185
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,130
vision of powers and conferences that

186
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,989
way we establish a so-called

187
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,459
constitutionality block made by the

188
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,380
constitutionally the attitudes of

189
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:28,300
autonomy mentioned earlier and this

190
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,300
asymmetry is in the Constitution the

191
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,990
block which is positive in two important

192
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:38,139
Constitution preserves articles 148 and

193
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,870
149 share compensates an exclusive

194
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:44,290
competences of the site respectively

195
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:47,680
this temperance system has established a

196
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,389
close your closed including in section

197
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,430
one and four nine three the following

198
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:54,160
those matters that are not attributed

199
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:58,300
expressly to the state by the

200
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,390
Constitution are available for the

201
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,880
tournaments however to do so they has a

202
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,579
choice of autonomy should embed them

203
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,189
expressly otherwise and a second

204
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:11,260
important part it is established that

205
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:15,459
those completions will belong to the

206
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:19,750
site why because we have something that

207
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:21,910
is not something that is now if there's

208
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,540
a choice of autonomy the autonomous

209
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,130
communities how they capability to make

210
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,560
laws and there are exactly different

211
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,390
uses of power what happens he is both

212
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,750
chambers of both Parliament's father

213
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,370
legislate over a matter the house

214
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,089
manager would you express it to any of

215
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:44,029
them that the actual said law will

216
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:48,500
prevail on the atomic floor dance the

217
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:52,220
so-called prevalence Clause and we have

218
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,230
other interesting matters in our

219
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,149
constitutional law were considered

220
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:59,829
following article 2 of the Spanish

221
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:02,750
Constitution autonomy is not sovereignty

222
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:05,689
national sovereignty as stated by the

223
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:10,839
Constitutional Court and capped by our

224
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:14,390
Constitution he's linked to the whole of

225
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,779
the citizens all citizens of the Spanish

226
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:20,079
site and we have other interesting bits

227
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:23,630
article 145 of Spanish Constitution

228
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:27,019
forbids the Federation nor the

229
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:29,480
autonomous communities regard or saying

230
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:32,209
that we don't have a intangibility

231
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,970
Clause we can actually modify anything

232
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:38,119
we want in the Spanish Constitution or

233
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:41,029
whatever we want and there are other

234
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:46,010
interesting elements the representation

235
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:49,070
of the territorial interests should

236
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:51,500
became or sure

237
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,970
be more deeply rooted in the

238
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,160
representation chamber of those

239
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,020
interests which is the Senate that's

240
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,660
what we should begin debating seriously

241
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,600
on this kind of circumstances that we

242
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,060
have experienced and there is launching

243
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,660
our constitutional text there is no

244
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,449
right to self-determination however it

245
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,770
could be a lead

246
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,710
reform of the Constitution does exist

247
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:19,490
and the autonomous communities are

248
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:25,570
subject as well to the jurisdiction

249
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:29,000
principle SAT article 153 of the Spanish

250
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:31,700
Constitution and earlier we talked about

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,840
two ways of the single town being the

252
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,010
first way and this love way catalonia is

253
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,530
for eight years of rama's community

254
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:42,140
through the fastway second transition

catholic nasa-tv autonomy in this case

258
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,960

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,220
approved as a very close national

263
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,950
parliament which are the participation

264
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,280
rate of a referendum if we go to the

265
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,670
official data

266
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,949
we have about which 15 amperes 1/7 of

267
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,449
the participation vote in February that

268
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,790
is all together

269
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,770
eighty-eight point two percent meaning

270
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:30,900
about 50 to 53 percent of positive votes

271
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:32,220
for that bill however if we vote to be

272
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,760
friendly to reform this attitude of

273
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:39,930
autonomy in August 2006 those

274
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,340
percentages do change is likely that as

275
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,239
a teacher of autonomy for CC's reform

276
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,730
through the celebration of Ralph's

277

referendum not everyone is you have it

278
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,460
but here they have it I don't really

279
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:55,709
need to have a big drink of water

288
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:31,439
that before 2006 because that's one of

289
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,439
the origins of the conflict in catalonia

290
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:39,869
and why does this have to do with

291
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,869
October 1st you can explain that

292
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:50,399
because we actually have a attitude

293
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:54,359
project approved in the current

294
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,579

constitutionally constitutionality of

provisions in it and other

311
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,850
constitutionality appeals are presented

312
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:53,420
were launched by other parties and other

313
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,420
autonomous

314
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,008
thank you much I kind of forgot to do go

315
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,579
to next slide so we do have this

316
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:09,250
situation here and we get to the

317
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:12,099
beginning of Independence is process in

318
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,409
Catalonia what happens or which are the

319
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:20,619
matters and we can see there are what

320
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:23,049
happens in fact with ESO Deuteronomy in

321
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:26,079
this period the least who October first

322
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:28,000
front is on king that the can't kind of

323
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:33,370
gets out that's right

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,850
we have a conflict that he's so

325
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,530
canonical way it was political a period

326
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,340
of economic crisis and situational

327
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:46,270
crisis it was a political crisis that

328
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,918
conflict leads into the initial

329
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,940
political conflict and that's

330
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:54,150
responsibility begins first as we see

331
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,150
next

332
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,609
we can see that regarding citizen

333
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:04,409
participation the leads to the right of

334
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:08,889
self-determination and that determines

335
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:10,840
secession unilaterally of the autonomous

336
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:16,139
community of developers over going from

337
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:18,879
words political to judicial political

338
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:22,049
and I guess when you this to me

339
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:27,330
distinguish two states one until

340
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:30,099
2015-2016 molars and then 2017 2018

341
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:34,049
thank you for going to Knoxville

342
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:38,158
so what happens in this first stage

343
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:42,519
after 2015 well the constitutional quote

344
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:46,830
her would have been warned about several

345
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:48,909
matters regarding the air support aced

346
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:53,559
process first of all so are things

347
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:56,159
regarding the meaning of terms 1010 11th

348
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,899
of the Catalan Parliament the first one

349
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:02,049
declared sovereignty to the people of

350
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:03,758
Catalonia in the second one the process

351
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:06,340
of segregation will depend soup

352
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:09,570
angelonia begins

353
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:12,040
they were also warned about the

354
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:15,730
unconstitutionality of three parts of

355
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:19,149
two and also law 10 2014 of non

356
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:23,790
referendum popular consultations the

357
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:27,330
will lead to is now away as if nine and

358
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:30,909
November ninth and also regarding the

359
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:36,429
presidency decrease the world likely to

360
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:37,450
our first consultation therefore we can

361
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:42,480
see that this conflict

362
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:45,430
marceline mainly with two matters first

363
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,480
related to the principle of unity and

364
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:52,330
sovereignty and secondly with the

365
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,600
Democratic principle of participatory

366
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,220
principle it is important to understand

367
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,740
that the constitutional court talks

368
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:05,310
about Constitution loyalty and other

369
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:05,310
important matters in that first stage

370
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:15,100
oh okay I think one of those lights

371
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:19,090
might be in the wrong place but in this

372
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,770
first stage of the participation non

373
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,929
referendum of the popular popular

374
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,620
consultation to distinguish it from the

375
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:30,810
referendum here the Constitutional Court

376
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:33,969
rules on the unconstitutionality all

377
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:39,429
bankers on browsers through to many

378
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:42,990
years some substantive reasons that I

379
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:50,740
said that such consultations not a

380
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:52,900
referendum are leading to call the

381
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,180
citizenship to vote with the guarantees

382
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,180
that one to implement as if it was a

383
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,310
referendum therefore has a referendum

384
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,070
form and that is either a concentration

385
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:05,679
or referendum we cannot play without

386
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,169
ambiguity that's what it's a saying on

387
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,390
the other hand we have not trivial

388
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:13,240
reasons so this is not a consultation

389
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:16,590
but rather even though being a

390
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,090
consultation at least for referendum

391
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:23,230
association then we go to Constitution

392
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:28,379
in article 4 149 those body in surface

393
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:31,510
if competencies of the state in part one

394
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,860
element 32 he says that this should

395
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:37,270
become very sight and that was not

396
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:38,800
happening here however if we take the

397
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,650
base is that the mother we're trying to

398
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,169
do here in ties the relationship with

399
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,600
the principles of unity and sovereignty

400
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,460
the competence for the heart pertains

401
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,070
only to the site that's what the

402
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,780
Constitutional Court says

403
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:57,750
an article 92 of the Spanish

404
00:21:52,780 --> 00:22:02,730
Constitution besides those especially

405
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:06,700
transcendental political matters may be

406
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:09,940
subject to a referendum of the hull of a

407
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:14,110
Spanish people not just a part of them

408
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:17,620
and here the Constitutional Court refers

409
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:21,250
on to article 2 so given the

410
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,439
impossibility of carrying out a

411
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:27,910
consultation on this matter

412
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:31,960
and carrying out an autonomic referendum

413
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:35,050
on this matter we now get to a second

414
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,570
stage and what happens here you couldn't

415
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:44,649
succeed well the indicating is even more

416
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:51,210
hard why because the Catalan Parliament

417
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:51,210
approves two laws low 19 and low 24.71

418
00:22:52,169 --> 00:23:01,539
for the referendum of self-determination

419
00:22:56,069 --> 00:23:03,639
Lord 20 2017 regarding the legal and

420
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:05,349
foundational front seat arenas in there

421
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:07,539
are other Republic now in the

422
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:09,879
Constitutional Court has ruled on the

423
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:12,279
constitutionality on the process

424
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:14,198
according to the principles of Koh

425
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:18,129
solution oil tea and national

426
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:23,379
sovereignty largest merchant therefore

427
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:26,678
the nation government using the 106 one

428
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:28,299
precept appeal the unconstitutionality

429
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,789
of both laws in difficulty

430
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:34,389
constitutional text that entails the

431
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:36,789
immediate suspension all the appeal of

432
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:40,599
those two hours however the

433
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:43,469
Constitutional Court 30 files does spell

434
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:43,468
check that cancellation

435
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:51,470
and the constitution of empty machinery

436
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:54,860
begins after different provisions and

437
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:58,880
grades they communicate to the castle

438
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:02,449
authorities related to the process they

439
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:08,900
can not act according to the referendum

440
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:13,550
of October 1st 2017 it is important to

441
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:16,850
know I'm clicking on X but our partner

442
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:24,230
need to click on it several times yes we

443
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:28,850
need to know that in those grades or

444
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:33,320
orders from September 2017 in explicit

445
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,429
way the Constitutional Court tones so

446
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,080
different

447
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,080
Catherine authorities I know they cannot

448
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,389
create census of files to carry out

449
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:45,270
doctor of affairs of random and later on

450
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:49,050
we'll explain that part more detail

451
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:50,730
and what does this pill entail two

452
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,899
rulings from the Constitutional Court

453
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,040
are quite important 114 and 124 from

454
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,710
France 17 declaring the

455
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:03,360
unconstitutionality of both floors under

456
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:06,180
the same principles that were made

457
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,379
explicit in 2015 this is quite

458
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:13,410
interesting because they're trying to

459
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,660
turn on the relatively high in principle

460
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:18,300
and they wanted to have a law of the

461
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:24,480
Constitution also above the basic

462
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:26,370
Catalan constitutional rule and

463
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,600
Longstocking Constitution bronze of the

464
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:33,110
a territorial rule which is part

465
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,270
markable here

466
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:39,709
anyway I don't want to bore you with

467
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:42,800
these matters and unconstitutionality

468
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:46,600
Ziegler's and your saw the news on that

469
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,930
date and it's how we get to October 1st

470
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,929
1:17

471
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:53,690
there was dissipation before a

472
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:57,320
constitutionalist this is light would be

473
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:01,070
blank for a political expert he would

474
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,510
have a lot of greater and I'll say why

475
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,620
some people might think that is blunt

476
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:08,390
because there are no constitutional

477
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:10,879
guarantees on that referendum or non

478
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:14,000
referendum because he having counsel he

479
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,860
couldn't take place therefore you all

480
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,830
know what happened I don't need to

481
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:26,270
explain this for too long we move on to

482
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:29,780
move on to the second item we know that

483
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:32,120
on the first of October what happened

484
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:36,680
then in that the Catalan Parliament

485
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,520
together with the generate that TRO for

486
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:43,040
push for the celebration of this

487
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:47,300
referendum so we have to ask what is

488
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:49,550
needed to hold the referendum we need

489
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,680
analyte for our centers and what's in

490
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:55,250
the electoral centers where we need the

491
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:59,570
data about the people who are entitled

492
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:05,950
to vote in the case in in this case in

493
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:09,020
Catalunya and how do you generate these

494
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,720
sensors well we have to go to the

495
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:15,230
organic law with the article whose

496
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:20,110
article 31 says that this electoral

497
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:23,300
sensors is off base of a public state

498
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:26,449
property and it is created through the

499
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,409
aggregation of data from the municipal

500
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,900
censors that cannot

501
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:34,120
given for free but that they have to be

502
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:38,040
subject to a number of principles and we

503
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,040
can link that with data protection

504
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:50,440
so first the principles of competence

505
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,690
and legality then consent and then

506
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:56,890
purpose the organic law for data

507
00:27:52,690 --> 00:28:00,400
protection from 1999 we're going to see

508
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:08,050
that there are a number of conditions

509
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:11,830
that have we met with sensitive data so

510
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:14,560
if we start from the fact that this is a

511
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:16,149
file whose owner is the state do you

512
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:21,240
believe that with everything that has

513
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:25,120
happened before the state is going to to

514
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,820
dis graciously hand over that part of

515
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,919
the electoral sensors of course not but

516
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,419
the Parliament of Catalonia and then you

517
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,530
write that were behind the whole

518
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:37,710
operation and therefore they had

519
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:46,320
prepared me they were ready for this

520
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:54,520
possibility do you remember the law 19

521
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:57,189
2017 it already described at the centre

522
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,810
the electoral centers was going to be

523
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:02,620
trapped for Catalonia in the

524
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:04,540
Constitutional Court for the in a basket

525
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:09,760
case had said that it was not possible

526
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:12,040
to have an autonomous sensors because

527
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,510
that is a state sensors and it belongs

528
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,840
to the state so if we go to that

529
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:19,060
doctrine of the Constitutional Court it

530
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:23,470
could not be done it was against the

531
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:28,179
Constitution in that now together with a

532
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:30,540
decree that developers need 140 2017 it

533
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:33,540
is stated that they're going to be

534
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Catalan

535
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:40,939
administration electoral administration

536
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:45,049
and that this administration other state

537
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:47,029
is not going to grant us this data and

538
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:49,609
the second question we have to ask is

539
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:52,039
then how are you going to obtain those

540
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:55,489
data and that when we start to consider

541
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:58,249
different possibilities one through the

542
00:29:55,489 --> 00:30:00,409
copy of the electoral centers that had

543
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:02,619
been legally granted by the state for

544
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:06,710
the performance of these self-governing

545
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:10,519
communities of 2015 or the general

546
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:13,309
elections of 2016 and how was the

547
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:15,109
sensors generated well through the data

548
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:19,009
of them and I suppose answer's no

549
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:22,009
perhaps some and some municipalities had

550
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:24,769
data about their inhabitants but let's

551
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:27,379
remember the data protection law

552
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:33,489
principle which establishes how this

553
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:37,820
data can be handed over and there are

554
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:41,889
and if a article 7 of sensitive data

555
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:48,968
those data connected with health care

556
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:53,988
this is a self-governing community in

557
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:55,759
power just like in the in the taxes that

558
00:30:53,989 --> 00:31:00,289
are collected in the self-governing

559
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:03,969
communities ok thanks very much that I

560
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:03,969
think every everybody is clear

561
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:13,189
when Ivan is talking about he's talking

562
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,780
about a sampler yeah well it's shocking

563
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,520
how much information he has in his head

564
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:22,010
and the same thing applies here with her

565
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:24,500
about articles and hard to do with

566
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:27,020
censorship and censorship persistence

567
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,570
techniques use on the first of October

568
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,220
there are people around here that will

569
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,490
know more than I do about this but

570
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:37,190
anyway on the 6th of September 2017 they

571
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:39,890
were safe and webpage the public

572
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:42,560
referendum comm where there was

573
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:46,250
information about how this process was

574
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,310
going to to take place in this webpage

575
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:52,880
there was no information as to where

576
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:56,090
people should go for hold a week later

577
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,220
the Court of First Instance about

578
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:03,169
Madonna

579
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:07,010
he should an official request to block

580
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:09,830
the access to this web page after or

581
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:13,910
following an official request by the

582
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:18,379
Civil War guard and this is where the a

583
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:21,110
cat-and-mouse game started they put them

584
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,850
put them on and I understand with their

585
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:26,770
a number of web pages that were a copy

586
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,770
of the one that had just been blown

587
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,360
there are the two examples I have one

588
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:35,780
acht

589
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:39,439
and that's where he announced where you

590
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:43,610
could access that web page just a bit

591
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:48,680
later a week later the worse information

592
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:51,290
about another web page were you could

593
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:55,160
tell even for people directly where they

594
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:57,830
could vote and this is the first time in

595
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:00,920
which it was made public through the

596
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:04,360
user account of Congress Putin life this

597
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,360
was the actual web page

598
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,899
you needed to input some data

599
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,789
specifically your national identity card

600
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:17,969
your birth date and the postal code and

601
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:20,039
with that the page performed a number of

602
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,909
operations that I will explain detail

603
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,010
later on

604
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:29,340
and then it's all where you have to go

605
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:33,059
and to vote and which was the R which

606
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:36,678
was the district and table where you

607
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:39,299
could vote so what happened then on the

608
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:42,059
22nd of September the High Court of

609
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:45,570
Justice of Catalonia he should other

610
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,580
take down orders to all of these pages

611
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:53,250
particularly the ones that provided

612
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:55,590
information to to be able to infer from

613
00:33:53,250 --> 00:34:00,080
this referendum because this referendum

614
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:05,250
was not did not respect the law

615
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,289
according to the prior no in what

616
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:12,719
happened next

617
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:14,969
everybody knows the Catalan activist

618
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,459
community with very deep historical

619
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:23,388
roots in Spain and you can read that in

620
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:26,220
our story helped to disseminate the the

621
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:28,139
source code that allowed to replicate

622
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:31,529
the web and the number of instructions

623
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,780
for people for non-technical people just

624
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:36,629
copy and paste of the command so that

625
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,089
you could immediately put up in the

626
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:42,149
server and your web page to facilitate

627
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:46,250
access and one happens again and wealthy

628
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:48,929
again the High Court of Justice issued

629
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:52,619
several takedown orders to block access

630
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:56,700
to these web pages if they were

631
00:34:52,619 --> 00:35:00,780
connected with this website or all of

632
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:03,140
the domain that were made public by any

633
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,140
member

634
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:16,039
censorship techniques when I am using

635
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:19,490
the word censorship or the aval the

636
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:23,029
capacities of a sensor are the faint are

637
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:26,598
say attack models in this paper which I

638
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:31,099
encourage you to read published in pets

639
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:34,609
in 2016 and if we look at the attack

640
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:37,579
models described in this article but the

641
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:40,130
takedown orders its its direct

642
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:45,950
censorship really you just block in

643
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:47,869
destination based on the own who's the

644
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:51,558
owner of the domain different things

645
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:55,490
could be done the filtering techniques

646
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:58,869
used by telephone companies they did TNS

647
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:02,118
timeframe it's easy to change your DNS

648
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:08,150
you use google's or whatever that's it

649
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:10,839
or you can use VPN and with that you can

650
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:19,099
also use the packet inspection to block

651
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:23,630
HTTP requests so HTTP GET requests if

652
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:26,170
they match the blood dominium that were

653
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:32,089
known to be blocked and there was no

654
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:34,490
delivery so what happens is that there

655
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:37,279
is a weight of 11 second so if you've

656
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:41,180
waited for 11 seconds you could retain

657
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:44,119
that if you've retained that order for

658
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:46,868
11 seconds then you sent it them and

659
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,869
that everything worked

660
00:36:51,940 --> 00:37:01,840
so sensors there's nothing but blocking

661
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:08,110
webpages and IPS so blocking access to

662
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:12,600
information as for resistance technique

663
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:14,970
20 no censorship 1 censorship resistant

664
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,200
system is a client-server architecture

665
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,439
software that involves component

666
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,580
interactions to facilitate and

667
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:34,650
unblockable communication between the

668
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:34,650
user and publisher there are two phases

669
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,760
system first you establish communication

670
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:43,860
and then there's the conversation so by

671
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:47,740
communication establishment he tries to

672
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:50,650
avoid censorship to look at a link or

673
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,930
and then start communication under the

674
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:56,170
conversation pairing cadonia there was

675
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:58,930
no system as such but rather his

676
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:03,060
technical structures were given to avoid

677
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,060
the blocking of the domain names

678
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:12,720
so what was the first thing they did

679
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:17,370
they said we have to do something to

680
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:21,200
avoid this blocks web pages so they

681
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:27,200
decided to use the distributed files

682
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:32,549
systems one of the web pages announced

683
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:35,100
ibf as web page which is an

684
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,100
interplanetary file system which is a

685
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,520
distributed file system it's

686
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:45,089
point-to-point

687
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:51,930
and the storage can be directed by the

688
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:56,640
content I whole point is it's a domain

689
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:58,700
that's in the UK so not in Spain so

690
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:05,549
things were harder for the state and the

691
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:09,049
connection was ATT HTTP a so man in the

692
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,050
middle attack

693
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:18,380
having used a PF is s to avoid the block

694
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:22,370
is actually quite a good idea here

695
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:24,770
because it is a peer-to-peer distributed

696
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:29,150
file system and that means that the

697
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:32,810
content is served by that domain and can

698
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:34,940
be replicated upon users requests so the

699
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:38,090
the main protein is no longer working

700
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:44,060
well and the storage is possible by

701
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:47,720
content so any user can know if the

702
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:50,299
information had been modified by looking

703
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:56,720
at the house they distributed higher of

704
00:39:50,300 --> 00:40:00,680
the information so this is all very well

705
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,600
but how to educate 5 million people who

706
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,890
had to vote in the 1st of October about

707
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:08,600
about bypassing sentence with techniques

708
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:13,160
well you use the Trump method you used

709
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:17,630
to serve that's it simple stuff what we

710
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:20,180
didn't want to access that has recently

711
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:24,110
been blocked or some other well people

712
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:28,520
who do those things download illegal

713
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:30,200
stuff what do they do we go to proxy

714
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,100
which is the cheapest way of getting

715
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:40,220
access to block pages that's what they

716
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:44,900
did and this is a tweet sent by karuppu

717
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:47,419
tomorrow to inform how from your

718
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,830
you gonna access these pages and this is

719
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,230
perfect because this is something

720
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,630
something everybody should be familiar

721
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:56,360
with it's important for everybody to

722
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,460
know how to use a proxy so he gave us

723
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,380
three proxies you use this one and this

724
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:09,470
one and then you go here you click here

725
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:12,530
and that's it another thing that was

726
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:16,669
done in the distributed way beyond the

727
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:19,310
web the web page was the sensors as soon

728
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:25,550
as it was saying that the server that

729
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:28,100
they have the electoral sensors were say

730
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:30,110
left in a distributed way and it is

731
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,750
still available in Internet and I've

732
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:37,520
taken this preparatory because I think

733
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:42,920
it's a trustworthy author and I want to

734
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:45,650
take a look at the structure of the

735
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:49,190
sensors is very simple it's a number of

736
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:55,150
files with extension extension dot DB

737
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:55,150
stored in different folders if you know

738
00:41:55,390 --> 00:42:01,069
just a bit

739
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:07,129
this is Exeter decimal so we have a

740
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:10,430
first Val for each file and within each

741
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:16,730
file there's a number of files which is

742
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:18,649
the second pile of a key sha-256 which

743
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,470
is calculated with the information of

744
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:23,510
each person when you wanted to vote you

745
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:27,020
introduced certain data and those who

746
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,940
are manipulated to generate a key and

747
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:38,300
that key

748
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:39,860
it was a sha-256 which is 352 bytes the

749
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,910
first one was for the file and then

750
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:48,150
earth for the file each file was just a

751
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:51,670
long list of lines in each real life

752
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:53,500
212 characters and the first 60

753
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,620
characters are actually the rest of the

754
00:42:53,500 --> 00:43:00,520
bytes of that key that I have just

755
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:06,759
referred to and the other it 352

756
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:09,250
characters were ciphered with symmetric

757
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,630
the graphic schema which is the one that

758
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:15,460
contained information about where they

759
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:17,080
have to go vote so we have two

760
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:19,930
possibilities here to routed or the

761
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:24,640
paper perhaps the paper one is more

762
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:28,240
convenient you see what they needed to

763
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,390
import the part of the identity card

764
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,069
birthdate zip code and then it gave us

765
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:36,609
in a change the information about where

766
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:41,970
they had to vote not import first of all

767
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:41,970
was concatenated and then it calculated

768
00:43:43,140 --> 00:44:00,850
1,750 times sha-256 and with that it

769
00:43:48,610 --> 00:44:04,210
generated a pkp afterwards either or

770
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:08,440
draw or take through the heart the PK to

771
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:11,410
get an S game which is a sense cloth and

772
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,410
with the skin it found exactly which was

773
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:18,149
the violin which was the the folder and

774
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:18,149
who took the files or the head to use

775
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:29,439
and then for each life

776
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:31,839
yeah nobody fell through several fires

777
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,080
for each line and here you have to find

778
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,180
the last 60 bytes of donkey in the first

779
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:52,740
verse the fortified using as you see

780
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:52,740
here 56 with CBC mode and pkc number 7

781
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:59,830
about the algorithms of why these 1714

782
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,109
is rationed well I don't know because I

783
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:05,230
remind you that a hash function is a

784
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:07,839
one-way function so it's given a certain

785
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:10,270
input is very easy to calculate the

786
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,070
output but if you have the output is

787
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:15,339
very difficult to calculate the

788
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:19,210
universal in advance or 80 that's fine

789
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:24,700
you're wasting cycle time in the

790
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:29,650
lighting our 1714 it's actually probably

791
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:33,759
a very likely connected with the date

792
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:36,550
where they say particular see trophic

793
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:42,390
Catalunya had taken place and when they

794
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:47,530
were as part of the Spanish Succession

795
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:51,460
and it was 714 because there was one

796
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:54,790
iteration or the output of what I was

797
00:45:51,460 --> 00:46:00,220
saying was trained separated a value

798
00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:02,900
stream separated by these simple devotin

799
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:06,660
Center name the address

800
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:10,830
information etc I don't know what the

801
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:16,680
rest is if somebody here knows what it

802
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:19,650
is happy belated to find out and here

803
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:24,810
you have an example of a person who has

804
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:36,000
given me the data I have express consent

805
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:42,150
I have their Python script and here we

806
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:46,040
see many where I have to vote and in

807
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:46,040
this string but I'm not sure what it is

808
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:55,770
probably for the check in a favorite

809
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:58,380
London Tea Party algorithm there's

810
00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:01,620
something else I'd like to mention about

811
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:09,840
the key entropy at the time there was

812
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:12,210
quite a lot of discussion they use the 5

813
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:16,500
last Egyptian letter of a Spanish

814
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:19,200
identity card you know that the letter

815
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:24,140
is calculated in this way so you can

816
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,140
compute it but if you cannot compute it

817
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:32,640
you have approximately 21 bits in order

818
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:36,950
to save that information the birthdate

819
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:41,940
in the American format a year month day

820
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:47,790
if we take a hundred years we can have

821
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:51,000
this range of possibilities that's 15

822
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:53,870
bits but this with this we couldn't find

823
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,840
you but it was not needed because the

824
00:47:53,870 --> 00:48:01,140
and you can only vote if you're 18 years

825
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,430
or older or so and as after the zip code

826
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,470
you have you

827
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:06,480
it's five digits and the two first ones

828
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:09,319
identify the province in this case four

829
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:13,430
provinces and the rest the other three

830
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:16,470
possibilities give you 11 hours 12 bits

831
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:18,930
it is true that we can also hear and

832
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:28,078
zoom in a bit because not all of the

833
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:31,890
values are valid so if we add all of the

834
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:36,869
width we get 48 point 27 bits and that's

835
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:40,020
less of what you need or equipped

836
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:45,079
institutions recommend to protect

837
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:45,079
against the eavesdrop in attacks etc

838
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:52,319
there's just one minute left okay

839
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:56,490
sorry you didn't have that much time to

840
00:48:52,319 --> 00:49:01,410
sleep so what type of responsibilities

841
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:04,140
can there be derived from what happened

842
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:06,480
in the first of October varies from what

843
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,730
we have both explained I'm gonna go

844
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,490
quickly but later on if you want like we

845
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:14,369
can go more in depth there are three

846
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:17,029
types of legal implications in the

847
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:21,510
reform of the Constitutional Court in

848
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:27,020
2015 the constitutional part in the

849
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:30,740
administrative part the constitutional

850
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:33,630
we're talking about coercive fines of

851
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:37,109
12,000 years per day because this is an

852
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:41,250
indirect responsibility for not paying

853
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:43,828
attention to the rulings of the month of

854
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:48,170
September and the rich derived from

855
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:51,980
these rulings but

856
00:49:48,170 --> 00:50:00,620
so we held this Express order of not

857
00:49:51,980 --> 00:50:02,210
generating these files and I summarized

858
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:05,690
this very quickly because we don't have

859
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:09,860
time for more but legal implications

860
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:12,490
that criminal wants and the liabilities

861
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:16,370
in this case are difficult to determine

862
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:18,620
why because we have to take one person

863
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:20,750
and analyze the responsibilities in an

864
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:23,660
individual way and with something very

865
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:27,170
important which is the evidence of the

866
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:30,890
act that has been attributed to them and

867
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:34,960
it was a criminal asphere there are many

868
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,960
possibilities direct and indirect but

869
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:43,310
but it is the procedural part of being

870
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:44,930
able to link one one crime with one

871
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:47,450
specific person but the Taliban were

872
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:53,440
dealing with a computer world and here

873
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:53,439
we can see different types of criminal

874
00:50:53,620 --> 00:51:04,490
act which can range from disobedience to

875
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:07,759
polymer seen right now during the trial

876
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:12,350
but we can link these two different

877
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:14,960
criminal types of crimes when we are

878
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:20,420
specifically talking about alive and it

879
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:22,880
is stated on articles 197 and 198 of the

880
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,160
Spanish Spanish Gulf with sanctions that

881
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,100
can range from one to five years of

882
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:31,879
imprisonment depending on whether and if

883
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:34,900
they were public servants they could

884
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,940
have in eligibility for five years

885
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,880
student ministry diverse liabilities of

886
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,960
the

887
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:49,490
hello PT fundamentally connected with

888
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:53,460
the routine of protection such as 6 or

889
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:55,529
11 or 7 if we are dealing with sensitive

890
00:51:53,460 --> 00:52:01,019
cases we are starting from the principle

891
00:51:55,529 --> 00:52:06,650
of illegality and when brother is a

892
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:10,618
liability regarding that action and that

893
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:13,200
liability if we turn it into numbers you

894
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:14,819
can see that it can entail

895
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,700
three hundred thousand two or six

896
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:20,759
hundred thousand thousand euros because

897
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:23,129
it's sensitive information so if it's

898
00:52:20,759 --> 00:52:28,890
proven for instance that these data came

899
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:30,180
from the health care administration but

900
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,279
it's also important to know that the

901
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,828
Spanish Agency of data protection in

902
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:36,750
September also talks about the possible

903
00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:39,329
personal responsibility of the people

904
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:41,880
who were participating in the electoral

905
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:46,349
tables and it gives us a figure and it

906
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:49,710
says in this case if the fines could be

907
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:51,059
between forty thousand to three hundred

908
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:53,390
thousand I think this type of liability

909
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:56,970
is going to be complex to attribute but

910
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:58,549
to finish and not for you too much with

911
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:04,339
this part I want to say that the

912
00:52:58,549 --> 00:53:09,390
responsibilities in this case are not so

913
00:53:04,339 --> 00:53:11,700
so easy to to prove or attribute

914
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:14,279
personally because the Spanish agencies

915
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:19,799
of data protection in the Catalan one

916
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:24,390
we're sort of fighting each other so we

917
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:25,890
can see how there could be a mistake for

918
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:28,190
those people who were at the time

919
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:31,710
participating on the first of October so

920
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:35,160
depending on the administrative trends

921
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:37,980
that we follow different actions could

922
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,680
actually be defensible or not or

923
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:44,790
different

924
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:46,919
so I'm not going to keep on talking but

925
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:50,730
if the general data protection

926
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:56,730
regulation had been in place he that was

927
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:59,790
say that became binding in 2018 perhaps

928
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:04,710
it would be easier to attribute them

929
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:10,160
there is liability and right now the

930
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:10,160
subject is under investigation and the

931
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:21,150
they are calling and this has actually

932
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:23,069
entailed the freezing at the

933
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:26,030
administration level because there is a

934
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:27,270
principle that that it's called

935
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:30,030
non-dissipative

936
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:33,870
you cannot sanction them but it tries

937
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:38,430
for the same action so in some cases to

938
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:45,529
become an example if you get no criminal

939
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:45,529
and by liability you can then move on to

940
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:53,220
civil liability but otherwise impossible

941
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:55,560
okay just to conclude the Spanish

942
00:54:53,220 --> 00:55:00,299
Constitutional Court repeatedly warned

943
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:03,930
about the unconstitutionality of the 1st

944
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:07,530
of October referendum and person level

945
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:09,419
in legalities of all arcs supporting

946
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:11,520
that referendum the technical

947
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:13,410
considerations we have already mentioned

948
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,759
them they take down orders on the one

949
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:20,430
hand and then distributed database or

950
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,110
distributed web pages in proxy

951
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:24,540
connections I would like to emphasize

952
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:27,090
that the electron sensors was

953
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:29,790
distributed in the world cipher with low

954
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:32,130
entropy but strong enough to do its job

955
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:35,310
which is to keep information

956
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:38,220
confidential so for an attacker with

957
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:40,049
their limited resources know from but

958
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:43,560
that's good enough but for this

959
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:45,120
therefore an attacker like a state a not

960
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,520
so much

961
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,350
to the legal configuration the bicycle

962
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,420
principles of data protection legality

963
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:53,250
purpose and competent have been violated

964
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:56,340
presumably and there could be criminal

965
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:59,250
and administrative responsibilities if

966
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:05,360
there are questions orders I'll be

967
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:05,360
delighted to take them how would I

968
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:20,120
podemos una pregunta se que tiene que

969
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:22,190
ser I have a question but we've a used

970
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:34,279
all of our time to get to them no time

971
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:37,660
for questions okay if there are no

972
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,660
questions thanks very much
