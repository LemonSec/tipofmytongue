00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,299
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,940
we're table table I don't want to stop

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,579
my presentation without thanking the

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,378
whole organization of Rudy I'd like to

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,270
thank them for the work they have made

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,570
over these ten years do you know how

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,369
hard is being effort that has taken it's

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,099
something which is extremely good for

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,660
everyone I would like to congratulate

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,810
you and thank you for that

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,180
the result is what it is great success

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,120
and that explains that you are doing

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,880
things very well and now well it's time

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,159
for a big hand

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,159
[Applause]

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,710
he's debate and I'm Jose don't you worry

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,839
if at the end of the presentation you

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,910
can tell one from another we have gave

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,460
up any expectations I just don't

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,949
understand why do Tom do you continue to

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,739
confuse us because he's bold and I'm not

22
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,949
but for some reason people tend to mix

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,220
us up so we are the founders of lahic we

24
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:12,179
are a small company we make research on

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,340
mobile technologies but also we've been

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,560
working in red team we also have

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,900
unentitled to do that and we also have a

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,790
love for assessing the security of

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,630
products we are in process of being

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,790
accredited by the CC and to assess

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,850
products and their liens methodology and

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,450
we also like to do other security

33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,449
services

34
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:49,490
until 4G and now we have five G very

35
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,829
beautiful then the lover spectacular and

36
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,310
then when you research mood you see

37
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:58,189
light from jumping from one tower to

38
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,219
another you go ahead so understand it

39
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:03,770
I'll take a step back and then when I

40
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,958
take a step back this doesn't get any

41
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,759
better because it becomes more and more

42
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,150
Kafka and I said well let us try to find

43
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,709
a more technical image so it is good

44
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,690
because it says us about the evolution

45
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:17,720
of Technology however when we take a

46
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,819
look at the box of 5g so you see an SMS

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,230
text message next to the Internet of

48
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,690
Things that it tells you that it will

49
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,540
transform lives doesn't sensitive lifes

50
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,629
that will transform and then I said well

51
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:43,840
I like these images and then you see

52
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:46,310
saucer washing machines blender research

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,380
gee everything that we are told about

54
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,739
factory and I don't like to be in

55
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,660
bombarded with concepts what after

56
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:56,239
another so what's behind there is a

57
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,690
network view textured and some security

58
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,519
features and then our objective is at

59
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:06,109
the end of this presentation for you to

60
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,250
have a realistic idea of 5g Network and

61
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,650
damn it

62
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,190
but also tell you about the state of the

63
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:16,510
theoretical architects 5g and the things

64
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:25,340
that have been resolved in terms of Fuji

65
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:25,849
well 2g sure that most of you are aware

66
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,829
of it

67
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:33,099
well 1g existed I'm not going to go

68
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:36,079
thread so suji is a network that started

69
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:38,780
for calls in the beginning mobile

70
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:41,919
networks has two separate parts code

71
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,840
from access so as we can see here

72
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,450
accessory codes were separated the core

73
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,420
network was switching subsystem which

74
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,760
was basically a telephony network

75
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:57,359
then a number of data features were

76
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,359
added and Merlin embraced by 3G in terms

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,940
of architecture 3e meant an extension

78
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,780
and the level of separate commutation

79
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,180
and then packet commutation what was

80
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,530
actually a revolution well I wouldn't

81
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,030
use the word revolution

82
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:17,070
what improvement of from 3G it improved

83
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,160
the mechanism for authentication and

84
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,860
destruction of keys it resulted product

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,340
of 2g that network was not authenticated

86
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,760
in 4G the most significant change in the

87
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,409
architecture well this time the

88
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,200
architecture is completely different it

89
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,690
is an IP network it is not a telephony

90
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,659
network with added data capacity but an

91
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:45,060
IP network and then the access

92
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:48,720
capabilities were also enhanced because

93
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,250
it is an IP network the hierarchy of

94
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,770
nodes became a bit quite flattered

95
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,080
simplified and then 5g it also brings in

96
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:02,450
a significant change in terms of the

97
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,700
architecture so what is the stator

98
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:11,880
situation right now about 5g so now we

99
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:13,530
have the release 15 okay but release 15

100
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,810
means that the stander having closed

101
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,750
down may be subject to some minor

102
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,160
amendments but that will be phase one of

103
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:26,910
these standards is now in first

104
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,360
according to them this version contains

105
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,620
the minimum necessary for the minimum

106
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,400
implementation of a network that's to

107
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,830
say pilot released 16 this phase 2 will

108
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,429
embed all the features and is expected

109
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,650
to be implemented in mid 2020 anything

110
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,080
nearly everything that we will be

111
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,390
telling you about it's about release 15

112
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,440
if we tell you something under a new

113
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:54,930
chapter it's been resulting release 16

114
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,880
is because we are telling you about

115
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,070
and now going back to the idea that we

116
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,770
are being bombarded with one concept and

117
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:08,780
another bad the purpose of 50 is to be

118
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,780
available for everyone to connect to it

119
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,880
so there will be devices for internet of

120
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,660
the scenes industrial devices of course

121
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,030
mobile devices vehicles that will move

122
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,729
really fast and ever need to connect to

123
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,039
something else this is the purpose of 5g

124
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:30,449
network but what is the problem when it

125
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:32,580
comes to implementing it you have a wide

126
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:34,770
range of devices and each of those

127
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,780
providers devices have their own

128
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,580
requirements requirements that are not

129
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,859
shared by the other devices if you do

130
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,870
that with your network requirements it's

131
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,930
very difficult for you to be efficient

132
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:50,280
because if for all your devices you have

133
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:52,860
to implement infrastructure with a big

134
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,960
one with because you have to do it for

135
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,060
all your devices this becomes nearly

136
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,500
impossible and that's the reason why

137
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,190
this is what has triggered the change in

138
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,750
architecture the core network well this

139
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,400
is a one hour presentation we'll be

140
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,770
simplifying everything but to meet the

141
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,020
main change that has taken place in the

142
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,760
infrastructure and but we were network

143
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,219
elements before now they are functions

144
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,690
functions exporting services in the

145
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,419
beginning I thought that it was just a

146
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,969
question of name or name so it was kind

147
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:27,900
of a nuance but later on will we see

148
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:31,650
that it's not onions so these services

149
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,349
are exposed dynamically we are not going

150
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,659
to go in through those services full

151
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:39,360
mobility management for authentication

152
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:42,750
number of services that we will not be

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,229
referring to but bear in mind that now

154
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:49,800
we don't have elements but services and

155
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:52,550
that also may change spaces for G many

156
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,680
of you know that in 4G and 3G

157
00:07:52,550 --> 00:08:00,440
elements of the cool network they used

158
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,389
Stockholm protocols highly heterogeneous

159
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,240
from previous technologies and the

160
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:08,199
beginning that caused lots of security

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,960
problems that were existed and

162
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,539
still persistent in 4G network in fact

163
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,849
ether has changed now a standard

164
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:18,550
interface has been placed in which is a

165
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:24,120
service based interface each interface

166
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,120
offers functions through standard

167
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:30,520
protocol and it is authenticated end to

168
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,228
end each of the two elements that are

169
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,179
speaking to each other are authenticated

170
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:38,050
and they are authenticated in a standard

171
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:41,439
fashion so this is a significant change

172
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:43,569
versus the previous question and then

173
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,269
interactions between these elements have

174
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,240
been described as well but it is very

175
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,680
important here because the function of

176
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,630
the core network is piqued featuring

177
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,969
themselves but I also used the cool

178
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,380
function of the network of other

179
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,540
operators that have implemented that

180
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,269
through two proxies direct and numerous

181
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,250
and those to practice half the channel

182
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:05,920
which is authenticated and secure and

183
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,990
then the communications of the elements

184
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,569
of the core network goes through this

185
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,589
area here so therefore it is ensured

186
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,690
that in in the network and then those

187
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:18,430
networks I have roaming agreements the

188
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,949
communications goes through a channel

189
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,930
which is authenticated this is not a

190
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:25,149
major change in terms of this

191
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:30,489
architecture verses prior versions such

192
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:34,540
as Fuji so this architecture takes into

193
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,730
account security more now I'd like to

194
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,349
focus more on their new security

195
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,110
features what has happened with the

196
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,269
access network the radius technology has

197
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:47,740
improved a large now but the legend

198
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:53,410
allows us to have peaks of speed and

199
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:55,360
then ultra low latencies well this is

200
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:01,240
also due to modulation and to the design

201
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:04,300
of the physical layer access Fuji is

202
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,880
also supported as well as access from

203
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:10,990
any network that means that if I am

204
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,290
logging into my home Wi-Fi I will be

205
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,390
able to connect to my 15 network through

206
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,118
my device this is embedded in the actual

207
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:24,809
standard

208
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:24,809
so the access network could be any

209
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:29,920
remember that I told you that been

210
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:31,629
hanging change which I considered to be

211
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,719
a nurse at the beginning it's not

212
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:40,029
amazing because now they mean in fact

213
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,999
you to come virtualize the whole network

214
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:45,309
you no longer have a single network but

215
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,989
a high number of networks I will be

216
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:51,579
referring to each of these networks as

217
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:54,910
slice it I like to use all Spanish and I

218
00:10:51,579 --> 00:11:00,399
like to refer to it as slice of bread

219
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:03,790
well I may use the English so we have

220
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,109
included here three types of slices they

221
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,429
are defined in the standard one is for

222
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:12,879
mobile networks full bandwidth

223
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:15,459
communication then another one for those

224
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:19,629
devices that require extremely low

225
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:23,768
latency and then another one for the

226
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:26,290
Internet of Things devices of low

227
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:30,970
consumption of these three virtual

228
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:33,549
networks that are whose parameters are

229
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,069
designed to provide services to these

230
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:39,220
three type of networks but I may have

231
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:41,860
very many different types of networks I

232
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,139
may define as many neighbors as I would

233
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,980
like to ask the operator and to me this

234
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:50,259
is the main change of these of 5g what

235
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,989
happens with the access network

236
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:55,389
well I cannot visualize the network

237
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:58,239
access because it's a base station fixed

238
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:01,299
elements can virtualize it but the

239
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:03,639
access network is aware of the slices of

240
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:06,720
the pool network so therefore all the

241
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:09,879
traffic that reaches the access network

242
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,850
access network talks to the KU network

243
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,829
and it delivers the levers of service

244
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,999
that have been configured for each of

245
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:21,128
these slices and that's the way in the

246
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:23,709
home network and the access network are

247
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:26,829
integrated with each other so if any

248
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,630
device of any kind would like to connect

249
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:31,599
because it requires

250
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,639
any given service he connects not to

251
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,380
never back to slaves and if you have a

252
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,019
device such as a refrigerator which

253
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:43,870
requires a specific type of service but

254
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:48,639
no latency may may be associated to two

255
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:53,970
different slices we can have services

256
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,970
from two different slices simultaneously

257
00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:04,139
device work when it connects it says

258
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:07,360
which slices to correct then the network

259
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:11,110
talks to a core network and both decide

260
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:17,250
which slice not all slices will be

261
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:20,110
available all the time no latency may be

262
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,449
the network decides it's not available

263
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,670
at that point in time so this is an

264
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:29,609
oversimplification of how it access

265
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:37,240
works this is a software-defined network

266
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:40,870
because it's eliminate the needs all

267
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,740
these slices dynamically by an external

268
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:51,339
provider the operator could outsource

269
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:54,730
this to a third-party provider according

270
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:56,880
to the know what is important and even

271
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,660
more attractive it is the new security

272
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:06,519
functionalities of 5g visibly 4G first

273
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:10,149
is an intensity protection heard about

274
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:13,860
easy cash in these akash in is the

275
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:17,230
tendency is the permanent identification

276
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:22,810
identifier that identifies you as a

277
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:25,450
network user five you can you

278
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:28,420
private network of the g5 for technology

279
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:31,180
there's no MC other indicates but it's

280
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,479
called soupy and that's the indicates

281
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,670
associated to you this is similar

282
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,380
information because it identifies the

283
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,199
user and can be used for malicious

284
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:49,230
purposes

285
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:49,230
identity theft etc traditional solution

286
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:58,510
this identify can travel use a temporary

287
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:01,000
identifier this was the conventional

288
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,550
solution is fangy you also have a

289
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,490
provisional one you can see here there's

290
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:11,550
a identifier of slice you're connecting

291
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:15,100
to is the same thing it's a temporary

292
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:17,760
identifier but in up to 4G it was

293
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,800
impossible to identify the user

294
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:26,230
identifier temporary identifies all the

295
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:28,240
time if I use a new phone that's never

296
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,490
been connected to a network and I use a

297
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,380
sim in the phone that has never been

298
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,370
connected to the network why this

299
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:39,310
happens this problem has it happens in

300
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:44,320
4G up to 5g there's a permanent

301
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:49,000
identifier the translation would be with

302
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,070
ciphering hidden by a public key

303
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,610
introduced by the operator in the SIM

304
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:58,060
card at the same time together with the

305
00:15:54,610 --> 00:16:01,740
identifier this is concealed and when it

306
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:08,800
travels over the air it's never traveled

307
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:12,970
openly but always travel encrypted

308
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:17,550
however one of the scheme supported for

309
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:20,880
this protection is that non-steam which

310
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,880
sit down

311
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,220
don't care about the network I'm

312
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:34,069
connected to I don't care about anything

313
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:36,140
so then this has to be centered but the

314
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:39,170
norms are now two situations in which

315
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,860
this null skin can read view is when the

316
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:47,920
operator decides when the operator

317
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:50,900
forgot to put the encryption okay so

318
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,900
this is a creature of feature that is

319
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:58,430
great but the norm leaves it up to the

320
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:07,930
operator to implement it or not we don't

321
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:10,510
know if it will be implemented occasion

322
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:13,520
briefly explain how it works

323
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,440
when Samuel announces there are three

324
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,030
players in authentication the first is

325
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:25,510
the user equipment connected then the

326
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:28,069
search ina and the network that gives us

327
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:31,310
a brand it's either movie star or

328
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,429
whatever in Chinese drama movie star

329
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:38,929
it's another network that's the serving

330
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:41,840
network and then these are the three

331
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:46,100
actors together what the users weight

332
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:50,840
means there was discussion about mg in

333
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,879
5g if this was going to be used someone

334
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,980
thought it was not a good idea to use

335
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:01,010
the virtual part they didn't like it so

336
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:09,410
this lady got really scared so it was

337
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:15,080
decided you to resign in a physical card

338
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:20,990
in a SIM card in you I see see this

339
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:23,300
physical card can be extractable devices

340
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,730
can be embedded in the device itself in

341
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:29,180
this case

342
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,620
it is necessary to provision that card

343
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:46,680
dynamically if you're buying an

344
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:49,169
extractable removable so in this way so

345
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,620
which all sensitive methods are

346
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:57,870
supported three of them first three are

347
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:04,260
aka a second is encapsulated in a cur

348
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:07,439
EAP and then the additionally to see

349
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:11,160
about how it works the authentication

350
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,800
mechanism since 3G it is based on a

351
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:20,610
challenge response the operate and a SIM

352
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:22,409
card have shared operator once when he

353
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:27,149
wants to intent to get you a dish was a

354
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:29,790
challenge and aut which is a number

355
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:35,520
derived from the challenge and it sends

356
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:40,680
it when you receive it you verify the

357
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:44,100
utn this means that you have

358
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,780
authenticated the operative response so

359
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:51,330
challenge is calculate and since the

360
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:55,830
network that's more less how it works we

361
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:57,510
will see this in detail step-by-step so

362
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:04,790
please don't blink because you might

363
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:06,870
miss out on something good that's it

364
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,490
don't worry because it's all in your

365
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:19,080
subconscious mind you just read

366
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:23,370
everything automatically okay details

367
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,409
here up to 4G who decides if you're

368
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,030
authenticated or not of the three

369
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:31,560
players we saw earlier user equipment

370
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:43,170
home network and the services network

371
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:45,690
who authenticates you the home generates

372
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,210
the authentication vector the challenge

373
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:50,940
but who decides if you'll be

374
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:53,780
authenticated or not is that network

375
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,550
that they are providing a service

376
00:20:53,780 --> 00:21:00,420
request the authentication vectors and

377
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:03,690
it is the network that verifies in the

378
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:09,560
case of 5g this is no longer the case at

379
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:09,560
home and looking five-year response

380
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:16,560
yes verification against the challenge

381
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,050
is done either services but then this is

382
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:28,250
also researched to the whole network and

383
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:33,810
it is also verified again the X is

384
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:35,630
function that talks to the user and the

385
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:39,990
key that is needed to generate the

386
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:42,720
balloon if it doesn't deliver them until

387
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:46,170
it has verified that the request is

388
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,790
under the challenges okay this is an

389
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:50,310
improvement because it could and now the

390
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,649
whole network to control authentications

391
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:56,040
and it allows it to do things like the

392
00:21:52,650 --> 00:22:02,610
resources fraud which it was the case

393
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:06,809
before home network then I have this guy

394
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:10,059
authenticated on my network now

395
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:16,779
what : Africa also has a safe another

396
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:19,239
important aspect is that for example I

397
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:24,330
go to China I don't know why it's all

398
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:31,080
about China all the time anyway China

399
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:34,600
and I know services network that has

400
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,789
roaming agreements with with the my

401
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,908
operator

402
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:44,529
you know this network record my codes

403
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:48,690
and it decipher them it records ammo

404
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:52,389
system so I don't trust in the pp never

405
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,340
up to 4G have no way to know if a

406
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:56,559
network that was providing the service

407
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:02,259
because the people network or any other

408
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:06,279
network to use the sacramentary with

409
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:09,480
Roman to get it to gets its factors in

410
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:18,639
5g this is not so there is an implicit

411
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:20,649
authentication of the services when the

412
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:25,178
function of the services network send as

413
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:29,229
the identifier to the home network it

414
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:34,720
also sends the network name verifies

415
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:37,889
that name matches the node of the

416
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,090
services a network therefore the name

417
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:43,570
during authentication has already

418
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:45,040
traveled through the home network when

419
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,790
we can't convey

420
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,860
expected responses to the challenge the

421
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:53,230
calculation includes the name of the

422
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:56,379
whole network and when that terminal

423
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,970
calculates expected response its

424
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,220
response to the challenge

425
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:02,880
it also knows the name of the net

426
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:07,000
community providing service that

427
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,250
response includes the name so now it all

428
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,010
revolves around the services Network

429
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:18,190
name because both ends no have to leave

430
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:22,500
a name I thought this was a point to

431
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:26,800
point out mechanism is this aka

432
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:30,570
encapsulated in AP and how to protect

433
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:34,960
your information just like algorithms

434
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:37,179
just like the same as in 4G protect the

435
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:44,830
integrity and confidentiality all the

436
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:48,490
messages in the protocols and the user

437
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:52,120
data that were protected in community

438
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:53,680
charity until 4G and 5g we have the

439
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,689
option of protecting them also an

440
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,690
integrity not only in confidentiality

441
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:06,580
but who decides whether it is protected

442
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,649
integrity to the operator again rules

443
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,669
allow the operator to implement and I

444
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,670
think it's not a bad decision

445
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:24,939
you have the choice they they say so

446
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:28,350
here we have the reference on how to the

447
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,350
top is the shared key

448
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:36,910
they told him on who decides about

449
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:41,220
ciphering or not which network the

450
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:46,210
serving or the hole no bad response no

451
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:53,190
services or network or home network the

452
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:53,190
service is right good the norm says the

453
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:02,800
shell means that it absolutely has to be

454
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:06,040
done when it's good that's different

455
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,919
it has to indicate the policy it will

456
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:17,320
follow for ciphering integrity in user

457
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:20,320
communications in some cases the survey

458
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:24,010
network has the ability to override the

459
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:31,899
confidentiality option in the UPC

460
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:37,320
security policy for example when there

461
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:41,830
is a regulatory requirement in agreement

462
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,419
which stipulates this condition if I'm

463
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:48,449
the whole network and I ask for it

464
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,450
ciphering but I agree with foreign

465
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:55,990
there's no confidentiality what I don't

466
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,270
really understand it so the operator can

467
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:03,010
do whatever they like so we have a

468
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,639
relationship in which their roles are

469
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,640
quite clear

470
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:19,030
finally briefly tell you how the access

471
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:24,580
to the core network is designed for non

472
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:28,899
3gpp arrises there is a function that

473
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,899
works as access point

474
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:38,659
IPSec tunnel is established between both

475
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:42,440
devices and through special tunnel which

476
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:46,370
is a 5g aka tunnel then it goes to the

477
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:50,480
AF that's quite similar only one comment

478
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:52,010
that in fact of it I piece eternal is

479
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,309
essentially a do not depends again on

480
00:27:52,010 --> 00:28:00,379
the operator installing the key in the

481
00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:03,350
sim card this is also at the choice of

482
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,630
the operator so at the level of

483
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:10,250
architecture and new function I will

484
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:21,830
leave you with my colleague David thank

485
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:24,380
you I've been asked to talk about 5g

486
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:29,240
attacks but you say how can this be if

487
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:32,510
it's not even available this network the

488
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,360
responses yes there are practical

489
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,559
attacks in the street against real

490
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:41,590
equipment no because they're still not

491
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:44,290
deployed but there are published attacks

492
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:47,169
describing the type of attack

493
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:51,129
whether vulnerability is present in four

494
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:54,670
and five G it has been demonstrated in

495
00:28:51,130 --> 00:29:00,100
4G and in 5g checking the rolls but it

496
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:04,480
will operate the same so that's the

497
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:06,070
concept as long as as soon as Franchi

498
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,490
it's deployed we will have quite a few

499
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:15,520
new ones let's talk about the MC catch

500
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:24,610
in which is you catch the ims I will

501
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:27,129
call it MC for short how does the

502
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,270
traditional or conventional simply in

503
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,570
succession work there was an

504
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:34,810
identification protocol and the mobile

505
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:37,030
said I am so instead the rules say if

506
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,700
you ask harassed your answer and there's

507
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:44,470
the MC and there was no doubts about

508
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:47,170
that so this happens before establishing

509
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:51,880
the ciphering keys so this dialogue was

510
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:57,520
completely unsafe 'red only unencrypted

511
00:29:51,880 --> 00:30:00,220
so this happened before security

512
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,040
therefore it was insightful unencrypted

513
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,980
so we're not MC off your call had

514
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:11,560
traveled in the open anybody could

515
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:20,040
capture it this is a 4G example the base

516
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:24,280
station software provide service with a

517
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:27,330
4G base mobilier trying to monitor

518
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,720
network the network request the IG

519
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:35,280
there's a time lag of two three seconds

520
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,280
finally it responds with

521
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:46,530
yeah we will see in the packets the

522
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:53,280
field containing not Emma see there's a

523
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:57,540
request which was answered I will face

524
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:00,000
false base has rejected it we can't do

525
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:04,909
anything else actually but we have what

526
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,910
we wanted we have the identity the MC

527
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:12,660
the video we see that the package is

528
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:16,620
open for each fear and the one that is

529
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:20,550
out that is underlined is the MC but if

530
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:24,780
there it is this is the implication in

531
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:33,149
4G up to 4G 2 3 4 G that's the way the

532
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:37,399
ones in 5g this is finished if I GE dis

533
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:39,630
confident because of that at COC I so

534
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,030
identities request the mobile was not

535
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:47,910
sent I am see that he sends the Susi

536
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:51,240
which is the conceal encrypted identity

537
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:54,120
so this is captured on air and you won't

538
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,750
be able to determine the sweetie so this

539
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:01,949
is result with a single button and

540
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:07,410
course I was saying that this key of the

541
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:09,960
operators included in the SIM cards it

542
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:13,640
resolved in the roles provided that the

543
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:18,230
operator decides to use that mechanism

544
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,230
so this is a big step forwards

545
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:25,120
MC catching cannot be done so this is a

546
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:28,629
big step forward now we will talk about

547
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:35,830
this a couple of Torpedo MC cracken

548
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:38,740
attacks does anyone know what this means

549
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:46,059
I don't want to be as old as you think I

550
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:49,450
am that's the pedo toe Peters track of

551
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:50,168
your paging message etc this car caused

552
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,730
an uproar

553
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:56,380
last month it was published at a

554
00:32:51,730 --> 00:33:02,590
conference in the u.s. just about five

555
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:07,750
weeks ago hit the headlines 5g network

556
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:09,790
is broken catastrophic beginning etc no

557
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,830
this was published in ferret but the

558
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:19,450
investigation was done in the course of

559
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:23,290
2018 so based on a concept that is

560
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:27,610
called paging occasion it is for each

561
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:33,460
the moment the sub my frames within a

562
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:35,649
frame sent by the base station that so

563
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,919
that if there is a granite called that

564
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:42,190
is when he will be notified this is done

565
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:47,710
for the mobile not having to be coding

566
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:49,809
and decoding signals on the time knows

567
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,429
when is listening the network knows when

568
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:53,799
where to send the message so the mobile

569
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,380
has to wake up every now and then during

570
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,929
the sub thread

571
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,490
listen checks up the pages and if

572
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:00,760
there's nothing there it goes back to

573
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,910
sleep

574
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:11,550
it saves a lot of batteries this page in

575
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:16,000
occasion causes the seem to wake up

576
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:19,820
depending on the ten least significant

577
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,909
bits of the MC

578
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:27,730
at some point this will happen of the MC

579
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,730
to wake up so how can attack I use this

580
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:38,810
I'm an attacker home I want to know the

581
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:44,000
MC / victim I start sending them silent

582
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:45,320
calls this traffic at all the page in

583
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,870
occasions lines you know which is for

584
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,730
him and I make silent court and i

585
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:52,250
annotate how many patients have appeared

586
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:56,929
in each thread I do it again and again

587
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:58,460
and again when I compare the numbers

588
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,860
there's a page in occasion in which

589
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:08,990
every time I make a silent code for that

590
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:19,400
phone number which is my victim there

591
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:23,660
will be slots that have a peak that I

592
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:27,140
know three things there know that the

593
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:30,170
victim is in the area because with every

594
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:37,850
son in court as a peak foreign

595
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:39,380
identifier the peak of page is a peak

596
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:44,360
it's because it must be in the area

597
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:49,430
because the area broadcasts only for the

598
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:53,150
area the ones and I also know what's the

599
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:58,549
page in occasion what substance this

600
00:35:53,150 --> 00:36:02,710
traveler will listen no separate bits of

601
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,710
it I am or the Tennessee it's not ten

602
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,330
because the difference in code

603
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:13,920
I dunno the emcee of the moment but I

604
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:20,549
know lots of things about the victim and

605
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:24,000
this can be linked another attack which

606
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:28,830
is the attack which is the MC cracken an

607
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:32,340
MC at forty nine bits us so you it's

608
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:37,259
changed a little but let's use the USA

609
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:39,120
example the first 18 bits are for the

610
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,950
country an operative if with it so Peter

611
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,620
got several more points I only have

612
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:47,609
fourteen to twenty four unknown and with

613
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:50,190
these within a reasonable period of time

614
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:55,100
maybe thirty nine hours I can carry out

615
00:36:50,190 --> 00:37:02,430
a brute-force attack consisting in the

616
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:05,400
false base station i centered MC I send

617
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:09,480
the service request to the real network

618
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:13,040
their network response if I say no eject

619
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,280
rejects so then if the MC is not valid I

620
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,490
insist

621
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:23,820
but if I get it then I make a relay and

622
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:26,399
I send it to the victim phone apparently

623
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,800
the request comes from the true Network

624
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,890
the legitimate time work then

625
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,610
mobile can respond with earth response

626
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:39,400
or or failure if it's an failure it's

627
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:42,100
because it's not the MC so I'm gonna try

628
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:49,920
another one one finally get the EOC

629
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:52,960
right it's given North response you see

630
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,330
after 12 hours maybe of work I finally

631
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:06,720
get it right and I know that MC of that

632
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:09,130
phone in the same publication of this

633
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,819
there were three attacks post the

634
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:16,240
piercer was the third they've consisted

635
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,920
in obtaining the MC of the victim not

636
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,049
through brute force of cracking the

637
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,550
mechelen mechanism was slightly

638
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:27,840
different based on torpedo as well I

639
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:33,610
know the page in occasional third victim

640
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:36,250
broadcast lots of repeated occasions so

641
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:39,160
that he can't hear the generic network

642
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:42,100
so then I make a sailor called

643
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:46,450
$2 more binder the network will launch

644
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:51,850
the paging to the wall by using the Tim

645
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:53,410
seen respond and finally connect word

646
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:57,910
says if you don't respond it through the

647
00:38:53,410 --> 00:39:01,960
Tim see I will just request using the MC

648
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:05,859
because this guy constants at all point

649
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,720
time when I already have the MC on the

650
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,940
face of Torpedo this is because I have a

651
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,939
page in occasions I just have to

652
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:17,170
repetitively sent down this works only

653
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:23,220
for G can you see why it's see the

654
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:27,460
difference clot is a part of the norm

655
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:31,259
and at the top at the bottom is the same

656
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,260
putt for fire G you see the difference

657
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:44,480
tiny difference and for Angie you could

658
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:47,920
do paging with Tim C or with MC 5g is no

659
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:55,460
longer valid now in Frank G the page is

660
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:56,990
just temporary identify as if it doesn't

661
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,540
have the temporary identify when they

662
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:04,250
must be something wrong so then in five

663
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:07,160
G this is also result that's why the

664
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:14,210
piercer was published this is not

665
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:18,920
applicable to g5g here we can make a

666
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:21,410
comment very briefly about the GSMA VCG

667
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,170
nearly a CVT this is an association of

668
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:26,089
the mobile communications industry that

669
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:29,570
are not the one that's that issue that

670
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:31,940
standards this is an industry

671
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:45,740
association with a close relationship

672
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:49,430
with a GS pp the GSMA try to minimize

673
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:51,950
the attacks in two times of 2g and 3G

674
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:54,500
and trying to keep it sort of under the

675
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:56,569
carpet but in the past in the past few

676
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:00,380
years this has changed and now they have

677
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:02,540
in the website phone of Fame so if you

678
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:15,950
find the vulnerability and you report it

679
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:19,430
to them they don't give your money your

680
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:22,370
work is acknowledged and the reports are

681
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:26,270
well this is a good step forward we

682
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:27,910
believe now to continue with a torpedo

683
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:31,009
an MC cracken

684
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:36,379
what happens

685
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:38,539
the GSMA received the report and 3gpp as

686
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,749
well and look at the change that was

687
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:44,930
from version 15 of June last year to

688
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:49,368
version 15 point one of September last

689
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:51,410
year the small change in the norm the

690
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:58,489
definition of the page in occasions

691
00:41:51,410 --> 00:42:06,049
where 204 G we had MC mod M 24 the last

692
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:07,489
time it's of the MC now we have teams

693
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:16,400
here this will be done with the

694
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:22,219
temporary identifier so this zone so

695
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:26,479
resolved norm for 5g provided that the

696
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:29,599
identify the 10 cm changes if it doesn't

697
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:31,698
I still don't get the same results off

698
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,609
before I get a part of the timsy but I

699
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:37,670
can't do brute-force attacks I can do it

700
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:40,130
I can track the user just like whether

701
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:47,089
or not any other type of attacks that

702
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:51,439
doesn't it's not enabled by torpedo in

703
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:53,179
secretly was based on torpedo now if I

704
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:57,199
cannot find out about this

705
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:59,809
bits of MC I can still make brute force

706
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,359
but I kind of do that with 24 bits but I

707
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:04,369
need that one bit that increases

708
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:08,630
exponentially the time that I need and

709
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:09,079
then the 13 hours become much many many

710
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,160
more

711
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:16,009
so therefore the response that was given

712
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:20,779
with this post this close to say yeah

713
00:43:16,009 --> 00:43:23,959
but that was done with the operation of

714
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:27,309
the standard and now it is resolved yes

715
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:31,160
it is true when the September release

716
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:32,030
was published in this element had been

717
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,339
fixed

718
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:39,680
so traceability attacks this is not

719
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:44,120
about finding out the MC but these make

720
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,310
real problems are know whether this MC

721
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,700
for these mobile phone is the very same

722
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:53,180
one that the same one that I saw

723
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:57,020
four hours ago now will like to share

724
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:59,480
with you three attacks so in the

725
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:03,860
documentation you will get references of

726
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:08,060
these - we will tell you what is this

727
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:11,900
attack about so this attack establishes

728
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:14,360
a key authentication of key same as a

729
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:17,270
key as Jose mentioned before it's every

730
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,370
old session connecting to a real network

731
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:21,890
to capture that and then win the future

732
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:23,930
when you want to know that that man that

733
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:28,879
you are seeing now is the same one when

734
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:31,520
you capture the information it tries to

735
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,030
connect to the false base station and

736
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:38,420
then it tells you I want service what we

737
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:41,540
replay is what we sent us our resources

738
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:45,530
every play that we have captured in the

739
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:48,230
real network and now we take a look at

740
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:52,400
the response if the MC is the same one

741
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:55,160
then it will well is this emphasis the

742
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,970
same one it would trigger mark failure

743
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:04,670
and if not sync failure this challenge

744
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:08,240
has to it's MC but the sequence number

745
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:10,100
that we didn't tell you about me tell

746
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,250
you later the number of sequences that

747
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:15,759
the home network and the movement

748
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:18,740
including the numbers of times are happy

749
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,950
authenticated does not match up with the

750
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:24,709
number of sequences in the mobile phone

751
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,640
but this mock failure means this package

752
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,560
is not for me

753
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,620
and because I can't differentiate the

754
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:33,529
response can I know whether the mobile

755
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:37,160
phone is the same one that I used to

756
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:39,740
capture these data so another attack

757
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,339
which is similar is this one I capture

758
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,910
the traffic of a moment

759
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:47,339
on that I want to if I want to find out

760
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:51,629
whether it is the same one I let it send

761
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:57,749
the Salvation service requests and this

762
00:45:51,630 --> 00:46:01,079
time the initial message that I could

763
00:45:57,749 --> 00:46:03,569
see when I saw the CAPTCHA I replay it

764
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:07,019
I set it out to the real network and

765
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:09,119
they answer we've nothing taken effect

766
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:11,008
acacia request I send that to the victim

767
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,839
and then the victim may respond in two

768
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:15,059
different ways depending what it is it's

769
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,650
a mobile phone or not if the response

770
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,049
will be Mac failure this package is not

771
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,809
for me all we've authenticated response

772
00:46:19,049 --> 00:46:26,190
everything is alright let us go ahead to

773
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:30,799
attacks now quite similar take advantage

774
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:33,089
that there is no security case replay to

775
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:37,650
that allow us to see what the mobile

776
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:39,779
phone is is the same or not and now we

777
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:42,710
have the sequence number on both mobile

778
00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:45,150
phones if they get out of sync

779
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:46,859
they never may believe that the number

780
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:49,940
of sequences 1 and the mobile phone size

781
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:53,940
note is another one so the mobile net

782
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:56,579
phone my sent and message to the network

783
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:59,130
and said look this number of the

784
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:01,039
sequence is not this one it is another

785
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:05,729
one that is sent out through an

786
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:07,440
anonymized key but if I capture enough

787
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:10,759
challenges from the real network for

788
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:16,499
that mobile and I send it to him in

789
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:19,170
pre-prepared sequence I could find the

790
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:21,569
number of sequence that the mobile phone

791
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,729
believes to have which is the real one

792
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:27,660
by knowing the number of this sequence

793
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:29,460
in the mobile phone if I do that in the

794
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,379
morning if I do that in the afternoon

795
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:34,140
with two mobile phones and then I can

796
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,329
see that that has increased by five very

797
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,549
likely we had talked about this a mobile

798
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:41,369
phone and also high likeliness for the

799
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:44,729
mobile phone not to be engaged in lots

800
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:46,529
of activity during the day if it happens

801
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:47,759
that they have nothing to do with each

802
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:50,339
other we're not talking about the same

803
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:52,650
mobile phone but if they have nothing to

804
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:54,500
do but then there has been quite a lot

805
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:56,780
of a big increase it means

806
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,090
the mobile phone class being in quite a

807
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,849
lots of activity for instance but versus

808
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:05,030
an embassy capturing traffic well seeing

809
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:08,000
lots of activity in the phone may mean

810
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:09,619
but may be relevant for them so three

811
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,510
attacks here to find out whether we're

812
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:12,770
talking about the same mobile phone well

813
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:18,050
we also would like to tell you about

814
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:23,980
formal analysis formal analysis of

815
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:23,980
protocols are about taking the standard

816
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:29,810
communication protocol you model it

817
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:33,440
through an automatic tool and then you

818
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:36,049
tell the automatic tool to test it to

819
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,150
see whether finds any security issues

820
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:40,640
there so sounds very cool because

821
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:44,090
everything is automatic tampering is one

822
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:47,240
of those tools it is a free tool that

823
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:49,340
you may download helps you model the

824
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,919
protocol here on the left with these

825
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:54,080
syntax and then you set all the rules

826
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,330
set out in the protocols and then you

827
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,640
said all the statements that you feel

828
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:00,560
are important well the key would not be

829
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,740
known by the attacker this would not be

830
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:06,080
disclosed then you click on play and

831
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,819
then it generates what we can see on the

832
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,759
right and says either I didn't have any

833
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,140
problems in no situation these

834
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,440
statements have been breached

835
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:18,348
oh other either tells you look I found

836
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,580
this specific case what if this sequence

837
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:25,460
of message takes place that that you

838
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:28,690
said that it's a Kabul

839
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:32,450
no so therefore before you you have a

840
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:34,670
specific example of attack with specific

841
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:37,368
sequence of messages which is very cool

842
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:40,130
but in theory sounds very cool but this

843
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:42,230
is one of one of the researcher teams

844
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,609
have used for one of the vulnerabilities

845
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:46,280
that we have shared with you and they

846
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:49,670
also found another one

847
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,890
so you can allocate a user at the end of

848
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:54,430
the day through the wrong session and

849
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:57,069
then another

850
00:49:54,430 --> 00:50:00,379
research a select group of researcher

851
00:49:57,069 --> 00:50:02,779
using the aka protocol

852
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:05,630
they also found another problem between

853
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:09,979
two nodes of the network that could also

854
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:15,559
trigger or enable the exchange of

855
00:50:09,979 --> 00:50:17,989
sessions I feel it is fascinating this

856
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:20,209
is very cool you model everything you

857
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:22,160
click on play you go for coffee when you

858
00:50:20,209 --> 00:50:24,169
come back you get to see the attack

859
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,509
however you'll have to model the

860
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:29,839
protocol and depending on how to model

861
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:32,779
it you will get an interesting result

862
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:34,369
notes another important thing is that if

863
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:36,650
the standard or the tool tells you I

864
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:40,420
haven't found anything you cannot be

865
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:42,229
fully sure as to whether it hasn't found

866
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:45,259
anything because you're having

867
00:50:42,229 --> 00:50:47,390
co-written but if it found that example

868
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:49,009
you can take a look at that example take

869
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:51,890
a closer look at it and then check

870
00:50:49,009 --> 00:50:54,339
whether you have done a poor modeling

871
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:58,279
you made an error a mistake

872
00:50:54,339 --> 00:51:02,150
perhaps this tool has just found an

873
00:50:58,279 --> 00:51:05,690
attack for you then from this recording

874
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:09,859
the false base stations traditionally

875
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:11,019
having a painful mobile communication

876
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:16,160
security

877
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:18,738
well we've seen in the culture that has

878
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:22,609
reserved some other problems but not all

879
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:27,529
the problems having matured resolves so

880
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:29,598
these ethical reports by 3gpp but they

881
00:51:27,529 --> 00:51:34,869
list all the problems that are still

882
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:39,440
pending about false base stations the

883
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:41,509
unicast messages both had our RC and NAC

884
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,259
data center with protecting the

885
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:49,069
integrity there are information systems

886
00:51:45,259 --> 00:51:55,459
protection then detection of closed by

887
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:57,589
false basis stations this is then

888
00:51:55,459 --> 00:51:59,479
considered because the mobile phones

889
00:51:57,589 --> 00:52:01,699
report whatever they see neighboring

890
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:04,430
cells that could be taken advantage of

891
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:06,319
in the network to detect anomalous

892
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:08,959
situations I say well there seems that

893
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,779
there is a false base station their

894
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:14,569
protection against the Sun poisoning

895
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:16,009
this is the self-organized network which

896
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:19,069
is a network that self

897
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:20,569
reconfigures itself will tell you more

898
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:22,959
about it will show you a specific

899
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:26,690
example about that poisoning and then

900
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:29,660
protection against authentication

901
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:31,459
Brinley if i'm here the false basis

902
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,839
station i cannot authenticate a mobile

903
00:52:31,459 --> 00:52:34,430
phone but i send it in through the

904
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:36,199
internet to a friend that i have in the

905
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:38,239
north of his pain and then the north of

906
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:40,819
this plane there is a team that

907
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:43,130
authenticates itself in the network and

908
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:45,949
just by forwarding what is happening

909
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:48,410
here to the north of his pain they never

910
00:52:45,949 --> 00:52:52,219
do Laconia will be fully sure that that

911
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:54,529
mobile phone is located there because

912
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:55,910
all the records all the logs will appear

913
00:52:54,529 --> 00:52:57,709
there the only thing that I have to do

914
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:59,779
is to forward everything that goes there

915
00:52:57,709 --> 00:53:02,359
and bring it back here because remember

916
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:04,549
that I have a friend in the north of his

917
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:08,959
pain that has a suffer with that is

918
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:11,989
connected with mine so this is another

919
00:53:08,959 --> 00:53:13,999
problem to be resolved now let us talk

920
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:16,249
about the self-organized network this is

921
00:53:13,999 --> 00:53:19,839
a very cool attack that was presented

922
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:19,839
last year and black hats

923
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:27,690
so this is a pouch taking advantage

924
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:30,240
itself the capabilities of the Nevel to

925
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:32,850
resolve problems to use them for bad I

926
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,100
am the one who owns the full space

927
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:37,200
station here in bread I take a look at

928
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:40,560
but it's around me and I say okay

929
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:44,069
stations coded and 100 200 300 I'm going

930
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:45,840
to use the 300 identifier I said that

931
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:48,480
for myself and then I will be delivering

932
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:52,590
a service when the victim mobile tries

933
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,750
to connect with me then I just drive him

934
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:57,360
crazy yes no yes No

935
00:53:54,750 --> 00:54:00,780
and at the end Aaron the communication

936
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:03,450
crashes then the mobile phone texts are

937
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:06,480
as a problem that occurred when I tried

938
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:08,669
to connect to 300 the station then it

939
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,130
will continue then in ask for service to

940
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:13,410
the real network and we are never

941
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:16,230
delivers a service and then whenever it

942
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:20,399
comes reports the network look I had

943
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:22,470
problems sure to go with 300 station

944
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,560
they never depending on how the operator

945
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:31,589
have implemented the reaction to that

946
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:33,540
report the never come perfectly decide

947
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:36,480
that the best thing that may be done is

948
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:38,910
to switch after 300 a station and then

949
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,060
to distribute the users between the two

950
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:44,670
other networks so look this is a false

951
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,950
message station and I said look this

952
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:50,670
network has this problem and then the

953
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:53,310
network denies disservice to itself this

954
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:56,900
is a very simple example of how the

955
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:59,610
network may treat my process the data

956
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:02,880
reported by the mobile phone and may end

957
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:07,710
up taken on making this dramatic

958
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:12,210
decision and these capabilities of a sub

959
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:15,680
n also present in 5g it is a problem

960
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:21,600
that operators should decide how to

961
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:24,450
approach another example that was attack

962
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,890
that was published for 4G I would tell

963
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:28,060
you about this attacked and I will tell

964
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:32,259
you about signaling and

965
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:35,080
then that would be it so this is another

966
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:40,180
attack that was giving a name a name and

967
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:42,880
the logo so this is a very cool attack

968
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:47,470
altar from altering from changing and

969
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:49,240
this is based on this it takes advantage

970
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:54,100
self remember that this was published

971
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:59,410
for 4G one of these encrypting mechanism

972
00:55:54,100 --> 00:56:02,009
is a es in the counter mode these more

973
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:04,480
or less works like this the plaintext

974
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:06,690
that is to say the data that you want to

975
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,950
send in for instance an IP packet

976
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:13,840
encapsulated in their connection then

977
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:17,500
you make explore we pseudo-random string

978
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:20,410
that was generated by the cipher so that

979
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,090
has the key that is useful deciphering

980
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:23,620
and texted to account other things such

981
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:26,260
as number of the sequence both the

982
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,569
emitter and the recipient have all those

983
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:32,910
elements to generate the same sequence

984
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:36,250
of pseudo-random characters the ammeter

985
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:38,500
does X or there is no attacker in the

986
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:42,340
middle then the recipient receivers

987
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:44,560
makes X all in the same fashion and then

988
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:47,620
it obtains the plaintext this is the

989
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,180
normal thing but if stay as an attacker

990
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,950
in the middle I kind of decipher it

991
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,109
because I don't have the key but but I

992
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:55,480
can do is just to drive in crazy

993
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:58,630
I thought it'd just make flip of some of

994
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:01,420
the beeps if I do that randomly this man

995
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:05,050
here will receive it and then wouldn't

996
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:08,650
know that it has been altered so that

997
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:10,690
will be an IP package will not compute

998
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:13,450
in their receptor in the end it would be

999
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:16,990
route up if I know which beats I want to

1000
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:19,080
flip I may manage to manipulate this

1001
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:22,600
ciphertext I will upload another

1002
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:24,340
ciphertext by the time may XO will be

1003
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,990
made with make sense in the recipients

1004
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:30,430
that the recipient will end up using it

1005
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:33,939
as a proof of concept researchers did

1006
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:37,390
the following they did specific example

1007
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,140
with ubp packages we know the size of

1008
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,690
them they had

1009
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:44,109
of them we know where the destination IP

1010
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:46,059
goes we know we roll if we know that the

1011
00:57:44,109 --> 00:57:48,940
victim produced eight at eight we even

1012
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:51,460
know the content of the field by knowing

1013
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:53,589
the contents of a field I can alter all

1014
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:56,260
the bits that are relevant to me because

1015
00:57:53,589 --> 00:58:00,700
I'm aware of these Saturday cypher text

1016
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:02,500
as well as the text then I have the DNS

1017
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:07,960
query everything is encrypted everything

1018
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:12,099
is hidden then i altered the bits I flip

1019
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:14,289
the bits when I cannot see but surely

1020
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:16,359
says 10 10 10 and then it gets to

1021
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:18,670
deleted base station and because there

1022
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:21,220
is no protection of integrity to kind of

1023
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:23,289
really note that it has been altered you

1024
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:28,089
will need to manipulate the IP address

1025
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:35,549
so that the check perform a work and

1026
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:35,549
then being legit basis station the query

1027
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:42,539
- while I sent in the response that I

1028
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,900
want to sent in and then in the front

1029
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:49,960
the origin will be that of the fake

1030
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:52,619
server for it to believe the response I

1031
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:55,599
would have to change the origin IP

1032
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:59,799
address it's the same mechanism and I do

1033
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:01,960
it the client takes indeed responds and

1034
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:05,559
I say well if this response come from

1035
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:08,230
this IP it is correct and I may have

1036
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:10,660
translated into DNS whatever I just want

1037
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:13,420
to have encouraged and then got response

1038
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:16,960
whatever I want so therefore I may retry

1039
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:19,960
direct traffic website traffic etc this

1040
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,940
has been this close for 4G is it

1041
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,009
applicable to 5g and this is not a

1042
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:26,619
rhetorical question because you should

1043
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:28,809
already have the answer based on what ho

1044
00:59:26,619 --> 00:59:31,720
says has just told you who dies to

1045
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:36,039
answer should it impact so should be

1046
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:41,578
applicable to 5g yes no I'm hearing both

1047
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:44,680
yes and no well depends on the operator

1048
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:48,279
that's a good one yes yes or no

1049
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:52,890
depending on the operator well because

1050
00:59:48,279 --> 00:59:55,660
in five year projection of integrity is

1051
00:59:52,890 --> 01:00:01,950
considered poor quality supplier not

1052
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:04,598
depends on the telecom provider nada

1053
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:07,569
chapter okay we forget about Radia now

1054
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:10,240
another chapter that has given lots of

1055
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:13,359
headaches before has been signaling as a

1056
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,848
seven diameter as I said lots of

1057
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:18,460
headaches because many attacks took

1058
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:22,329
advantage of it so Jose has just told

1059
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:24,369
you how 50 works now now we are talking

1060
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:28,119
about services easy connection is

1061
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:31,779
protected the HTTP services and

1062
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:34,750
consulted on top of Clell TLS everything

1063
01:00:31,779 --> 01:00:37,869
is encrypted cipher everything is

1064
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:40,299
authenticated he authorizes whether says

1065
01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:42,730
yes or no this is well thought I may

1066
01:00:40,299 --> 01:00:44,769
criticize the other and and then may

1067
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:46,539
decide what information I want to

1068
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:48,970
authorize what information want to give

1069
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:50,799
from their abilities as of today none of

1070
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:54,220
them have been disclosed attacks none of

1071
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:56,049
them have been punished the thing from

1072
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:58,450
greater that applied to 4G and we've

1073
01:00:56,049 --> 01:01:01,269
seen examples here nothing we know

1074
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:05,939
nothing about this now we will start to

1075
01:01:01,269 --> 01:01:08,919
see it published by the time things will

1076
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:11,829
however we believe that the reason they

1077
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:16,480
here in problem here and hopefully will

1078
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:22,660
be resolved is the issue with the model

1079
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:26,640
of trust authenticated ends two ways I

1080
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:30,009
may decide what I want to give access to

1081
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:33,210
permit something about an end for the

1082
01:01:30,009 --> 01:01:35,319
roaming of my user to work with all the

1083
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:37,599
telecom providers in the world

1084
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:40,269
I should have specific rules to see what

1085
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:43,029
operator what information I want to give

1086
01:01:40,269 --> 01:01:46,839
the mechanisms are there but how can I

1087
01:01:43,029 --> 01:01:49,140
manage that how do I do it so that I end

1088
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:53,019
up delivering just the bare minimum

1089
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:53,690
information well we will look at dar we

1090
01:01:53,019 --> 01:02:00,290
will

1091
01:01:53,690 --> 01:02:04,280
I'm will unfold so let us see whether

1092
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:08,480
with this new system there will be less

1093
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:12,080
attacks than in the past all these that

1094
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:14,720
was I mentioned Jose before when we

1095
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:17,930
started doing all that we started to see

1096
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:20,689
all these lights and all that so we've

1097
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:24,379
been trying to explain to you what is

1098
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:26,330
the status of 50 Tuesday what happens

1099
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,700
with the security of it what are the

1100
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:31,870
security things that having results and

1101
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:35,359
those that are dead painting we would be

1102
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:37,400
very happy if when you leave this room

1103
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,040
with someone asks you what about five

1104
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:44,960
year do you know anything about hygiene

1105
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:49,580
if you don't pull this face this is the

1106
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:51,890
face you must do okay so that was the

1107
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:53,420
objective of this presentation we'd like

1108
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:56,270
to thank you very much for being here

1109
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:57,740
for your attention and what's more we

1110
01:02:56,270 --> 01:03:13,220
would like to thank you to come for

1111
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:17,209
having invited us out any questions well

1112
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:21,560
okay I was going to go first but you go

1113
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:24,290
ahead Julio so half a doubt everything

1114
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,450
that is said before about dependency of

1115
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:28,670
what the operator may decide to do in

1116
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:31,220
terms of protecting the integrity and

1117
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:32,840
ciphering or encryption other than the

1118
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:35,120
emergency other than in technical

1119
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,760
reasons for that or perhaps you feel

1120
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:40,640
that this is just to accommodate the

1121
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:47,350
intentions of some countries and

1122
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:50,299
therefore accepting the same standard

1123
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:52,700
than these countries well intentions we

1124
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:55,400
just don't know about the intentions we

1125
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:58,819
cannot possibly know however I'm sure

1126
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,360
that there is an element that has played

1127
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:02,360
a role

1128
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:08,030
according to legislation in some country

1129
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:12,890
and lo 4 beats ciphering if the standard

1130
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:15,020
would made cycling mandatory there will

1131
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:17,750
be a problem if they want to apply the

1132
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:19,340
standard even in those case but I

1133
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:21,320
understand that it is logical that they

1134
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:24,080
want to apply the standard even in those

1135
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:26,810
cases and then what I don't find logical

1136
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:29,690
is that the operator does not decide to

1137
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:31,400
implement it but this is very my very

1138
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:33,080
personal opinion I think there is a bit

1139
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,600
of everything in some cases for instance

1140
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:37,790
in the activation of suffering at the

1141
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:40,130
level of the user so here the question

1142
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,779
is more that of countries because in

1143
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:44,690
some countries the decision does not

1144
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:46,370
allowed to suffer however in times of

1145
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:49,340
provisioning of cars there is a

1146
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:51,020
technical issue provision in cards but

1147
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,120
some operators may not have the good

1148
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:57,200
enough information to provision

1149
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:59,359
certificates for public key for

1150
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,480
operators they may not have that in

1151
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,070
their supplying infrastructures they may

1152
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,990
not have the good enough information to

1153
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:08,000
provide that infrastructure to provide

1154
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:10,370
that type of information I feel that

1155
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,920
this Tunde didn't want to oblige

1156
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:15,380
operators to destroy all that because

1157
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:17,180
Stanga has been impacted or influenced

1158
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:19,580
by the industry I'm sure that some

1159
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:22,370
industry said please do not force me to

1160
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:24,560
deploy in all the stores the

1161
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:26,660
infrastructure needed to make this type

1162
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,250
of provision so this is just my opinion

1163
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:31,339
but I think there is a bit of everything

1164
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:33,560
but actually my question is related to

1165
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:35,750
that if you have millions of operators

1166
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:39,100
in the world to you how we have to

1167
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:42,530
provision all the operators known in the

1168
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:44,210
SI am what happens with omv there should

1169
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:46,340
be a great history of operator assessing

1170
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:47,210
it or something like that yes that could

1171
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,490
be a big issue

1172
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:54,650
what do you provision your own cards

1173
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:56,270
your cards but if you oblige everyone to

1174
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:58,850
provision there cuts that would be very

1175
01:05:56,270 --> 01:06:00,320
difficult to handle and I think that the

1176
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:02,660
standard just didn't want to include

1177
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:06,140
that so you cannot really provision a

1178
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:09,049
SIM card big public keys of all the

1179
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:11,660
operators across the world for me to

1180
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:14,230
know that I'm connecting myself to the

1181
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:18,399
real one I will have to validate it

1182
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:19,930
somehow to believe the validations of

1183
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,190
integrity all the things that reducing

1184
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:25,540
in the industry for that and we said

1185
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:28,150
peak K I and then root entity but let us

1186
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:31,390
see who is brave enough to say I trust

1187
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:37,210
the root entity to be who claims to be

1188
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:39,670
yes the mobile phone asking the DCP but

1189
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:41,619
the document says that they consider

1190
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:45,700
using different restriction of the

1191
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:48,490
public network and to use it beyond but

1192
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:51,368
no no agreement has been reached there

1193
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:53,740
so when SIM cards are embedded in the

1194
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:55,300
first provision that dynamically there

1195
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:58,868
are some mechanisms are having defined

1196
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:01,839
however they require agreement between

1197
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:05,589
the operator and the manufacturer of the

1198
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:07,960
device and then some expire certificates

1199
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:11,980
revoked certificates you name it

1200
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:13,930
managing all the public keys could be a

1201
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:17,050
big big problem that falls outside the

1202
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:18,430
estándares look if I am the one who

1203
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:21,220
makes the stand I said look I'm not

1204
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:23,319
going to regulate that for you then they

1205
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:27,819
will go to digit set they will steal

1206
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:30,279
they see a well for the time being they

1207
01:07:27,819 --> 01:07:32,619
are not ready to do that i manufacturers

1208
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:34,450
specialized in industrial devices that

1209
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:38,560
do not have good enough experience in

1210
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:41,200
security they may put their fault inator

1211
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:44,980
perhaps they will do excellent work we

1212
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:48,819
just now so last minutes for you call

1213
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:50,680
for your questions we are about to close

1214
01:07:48,819 --> 01:07:53,770
Richard Connor but you said that when

1215
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:58,029
the network will communicate with other

1216
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:59,460
networks or with Roman networks you said

1217
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:02,230
that a tunnel

1218
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:06,010
IPSec to is created is there a reason

1219
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:08,980
for that so that will generate first of

1220
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:10,540
all that latency will shoot up because

1221
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:13,720
the two phases have to be negotiated

1222
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:17,769
then he does say wild overhead that is

1223
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:20,139
adding a vector of attack well it could

1224
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:22,270
add a vector of attack in case they were

1225
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,770
implemented of course and perhaps a

1226
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:26,669
vector may not be necessary because

1227
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:32,099
after the aka everything is in

1228
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:34,589
channel is encrypted what perhaps they

1229
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:37,679
did it to offer the possibility to

1230
01:08:34,589 --> 01:08:40,408
authenticate at least the channel and

1231
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,839
that the end of the level is also

1232
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:44,518
authenticated and that only that only

1233
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:46,679
take place if the operator has

1234
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:48,719
provisioned the certificate I could

1235
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:49,739
understand that 15 years ago but

1236
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,679
nowadays there are very many

1237
01:08:49,738 --> 01:08:55,408
alternatives without recurrent to that

1238
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:58,288
yes you are very right so the reason

1239
01:08:55,408 --> 01:09:06,419
that have pushed them to choose that

1240
01:08:58,288 --> 01:09:12,299
mechanism I just now and now when you

1241
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:14,429
are making MC cracken so a query is made

1242
01:09:12,299 --> 01:09:20,578
to the real network you can also apply

1243
01:09:14,429 --> 01:09:25,139
that in 4G is how you make refers to the

1244
01:09:20,578 --> 01:09:26,669
real provider by trying different well

1245
01:09:25,139 --> 01:09:28,349
that depends on the configuration of the

1246
01:09:26,669 --> 01:09:32,729
operator and the operator and may go and

1247
01:09:28,349 --> 01:09:35,639
say what you are sending me 50 queries

1248
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:38,819
one after another enough have you tested

1249
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:48,499
that no we didn't test that not yet not

1250
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:53,339
yet oh thank you question over there

1251
01:09:48,499 --> 01:09:58,169
congratulations for your presentation so

1252
01:09:53,339 --> 01:10:01,590
in between phase 1 and phase 2 what are

1253
01:09:58,169 --> 01:10:08,519
the differences in 5g come on what a

1254
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:10,530
question the answer is we just know that

1255
01:10:08,519 --> 01:10:13,229
if things I will have enriched to be

1256
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:16,409
these 16 jet but are you talking about

1257
01:10:13,229 --> 01:10:18,510
in this specific difference what many

1258
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:20,459
people feel that 50 will come this year

1259
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:24,059
but there is a bit of a confusion there

1260
01:10:20,459 --> 01:10:26,849
will be five and a half G which will be

1261
01:10:24,059 --> 01:10:29,550
a transition one many 4G attacks will be

1262
01:10:26,849 --> 01:10:33,229
replicated by this embassy 15 the mobile

1263
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:36,469
phone but actually it is not a pure 5g I

1264
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:39,269
just would like to

1265
01:10:36,469 --> 01:10:43,070
but to tell us more about it but the

1266
01:10:39,269 --> 01:10:43,070
honest answer be just enough

1267
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:57,840
well a last brave person for the closing

1268
01:10:51,110 --> 01:11:01,438
question of frigid come well did you say

1269
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:03,380
it like that all right

1270
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:06,220
thank you very much to everyone

1271
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,220
[Applause]
