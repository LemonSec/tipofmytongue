1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,680
mr. Sanchez thank you for being here I

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,860
appreciate this this is early morning

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,960
Saturday and people were having

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,120
well lining and while Inga stated very

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,940
late hours and I appreciate this

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,090
I had my presentation this early morning

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,230
and I decided to leave it untouched

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,640
because the way it was was correct so I

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,910
would like to thank the organizers of

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,690
this rooted meeting Joelle is not here

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,989
but my presentation is have a both of us

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:41,430
and if I say both of us it is because it

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:44,040
is joyous work also as it is my work

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,079
this is hardware hacking that's my table

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,719
my desk and everything that's been

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,410
organized for the picture I have very

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,680
many devices on top of my desk to use

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,300
this for good things to good

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,090
contributing to enhance information and

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,459
I love to have this and I love to share

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,760
with all of you and all of the community

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,799
what I do don't be bad guys please and

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,850
of course with what I'm going to tell

24
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,689
you you can do whatever you feel about

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,479
doing but of course please do good

26
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,039
things with that so I'm going to start

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,289
now we have a problem

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,290
software problem perhaps we'll see

29
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:33,610
I was looking for batteries and now I

30
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:38,500
have low batteries anyway I'm going to

31
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:40,840
continue while I change the batteries as

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,850
you know to a Serna who's not here with

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:49,990
us as fighting and security issues and

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:52,630
Airlines my name is Sarah security

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,589
issues regarding radio broadcasting and

36
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:59,440
cell phones and mobile films I am based

37
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:02,020
on security of radio broadcasting

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,560
do-it-yourself as it was said before

39
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,840
during the panel session hackers and

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,190
hacking for us it's a way of thinking

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,310
that it's it's information technology

42
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,959
and of course this is not working as

43
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:23,140
usual whenever we need something it has

44
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:26,110
worked so as I said the old skool

45
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:30,488
hackers said that everything is out of

46
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:33,940
curiosity as he means the curiosity and

47
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:36,640
the way of living this could be hacker

48
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,780
without being an information technology

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,140
expert I know hackers who are not in the

50
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:48,390
field of information technology and I

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,390
don't know it just work let's see why

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:58,750
but if you keep it on our my like it

53
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:03,690
works and here you have a summary we

54
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:06,489
have presented three parts first of the

55
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,160
it's where we are where do we come from

56
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,420
what would like to go to tell you where

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,940
we come from what we do hardware hacking

58
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,518
issues to explain how it's done you will

59
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,940
concentrating on one issue this is a

60
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,850
very broad issue hardware hacking for

61
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:28,000
you to work on that and to experiment

62
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:30,459
with this like tinkering with all those

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,340
things we're going to use this for good

64
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:37,000
things once we have hacked

65
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,010
well had this hacking well this is the

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,190
first thing where do we come from where

67
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:46,840
would we like to go and why we've done

68
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:51,010
this and with what or the words and in

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,500
the end we've done as this video system

70
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,109
this is part of your presentation looks

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,660
very huge but this is a tiny device it's

72
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:02,140
a tiny device it looks like a credit

73
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,900
card you can have it inside your wallet

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,429
and if you would like to come and take a

75
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,190
look at it it's easy

76
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,930
where does it come from those small

77
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,440
devices

78
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,820
Doyle and I were known because we gave

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:21,820
some information on the USB and things

80
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,729
we presented remote control items and

81
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:29,560
Wi-Fi issues and then there was a moment

82
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:32,349
when we decided to add a screen and to

83
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,780
have a keyboard to have something we

84
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,419
could configure and we bought the

85
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,059
material to assemble this with all the

86
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:42,159
cables and in search for excellence and

87
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,770
search for that because someone else

88
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,190
should have had the same idea to add a

89
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,500
screen and add some bottoms turrets and

90
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:55,150
of course yes that had already been

91
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,760
invented this is the idea we had it is

92
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:01,989
what we're about to construct so if it

93
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:04,539
was already available for games but why

94
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,030
not someone had done this so let's work

95
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:11,830
on this and let's work with this and how

96
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:14,669
to hack there's free hardware thing to

97
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:18,190
abuse ourselves and to train ourselves

98
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:21,280
this is an easy way to control and check

99
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,370
our results this is something we take

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,429
for granted you can take it as the book

101
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:30,970
you had in high school or you get

102
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:34,120
results at the end and the answers it

103
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:37,419
was very easy to see if we've got a

104
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,000
proper answer we have a source code

105
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:42,789
that's free and everything and we can

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,960
control our solutions were correct and

107
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:49,669
of course it's

108
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:54,080
much more it's easier and it's a very I

109
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:57,889
would say rewarding things to do so very

110
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,530
important thing is then there is a huge

111
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:05,150
community there are very many people of

112
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:08,630
developing this developers of art boy RG

113
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:12,380
boy it's something that makes sense and

114
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:18,800
then we have the Arduino community big

115
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:22,820
communities and we have r2 boy and we

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,580
have Arduino and there will be a willing

117
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,419
to help us I still have problems with my

118
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,430
batteries as usual so hardware hacking

119
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:35,150
why do we consider this as hacking

120
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,880
because in the end this is just a small

121
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:41,929
device and that we are controlling for

122
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:45,229
cybersecurity issues and this is speech

123
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,659
well it's fun it's cool it's fine it's a

124
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,240
nice hardware because if you don't like

125
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:53,449
it you can just throw it against wall

126
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,180
and the thicket and out of your place

127
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:58,490
because it's not very expensive we're

128
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,830
not going to talk about advanced systems

129
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:05,530
and complex systems what we're going to

130
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:08,810
talk about as heat-ray treating the

131
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,570
integrated circuits now it is outside of

132
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,599
what we general public would like to

133
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:18,740
have and let's be hands-on here hands-on

134
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:21,139
and let's go into the sort of core

135
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,840
subject after the introduction who have

136
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:26,509
the small device beautiful device as I

137
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,909
said it looks great so to have an idea

138
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,550
it looks like a credit card as big as a

139
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:33,949
credit card and it is as thick as three

140
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:38,259
credit cards put together that's it and

141
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:41,630
as I said before we're going to be very

142
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:43,789
internal terms what we have to do is we

143
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,550
have to access the circuit and of course

144
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:49,169
we have some the screws subsequently

145
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,360
some safety screws and

146
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,640
that I don't know who's selling the

147
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,000
screws but that looks fine when you have

148
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,219
a screw that is in general it's very

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,240
expensive the screws are very expensive

150
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,790
and the devices to manipulate them are

151
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,010
very expensive too and someone had the

152
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,830
idea that that was a good idea and

153
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:16,620
they're selling this as a physical mode

154
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:19,050
of adding security to it and we have a

155
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,410
hundred hundred keys here and it will

156
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,770
cost ten dollars only ten dollars it's

157
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:30,300
not very very very safe but I'd like to

158
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:34,470
say that there are specialized companies

159
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:38,220
you can order the ahead you would like

160
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:40,200
to have you can use well problem is that

161
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,260
if you use a screwdriver to take it out

162
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,990
you destroy the whole thing we have

163
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,810
balls we have protections we have

164
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,810
different types of solutions you going

165
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:55,560
to use drills and with the drill it can

166
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:58,589
take it out it could look bit violent a

167
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,989
bit tough now we are doing this but we

168
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,150
should have to analyze that we're going

169
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:08,310
to destroy some of the devices were

170
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:10,890
going to hack and please so that's it

171
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:16,859
you have to invest on hardware and then

172
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:20,460
we have as we see the sort of seal and

173
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:25,170
seal carcasses looking like they have no

174
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:28,310
no screws it is because they're sealed

175
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,589
they are with hot temperature and

176
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:34,589
ultrasound the only way to open this is

177
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:39,290
to break them but you don't need you can

178
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:44,220
have seen people trying to use very very

179
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:49,920
very I would say different methods you

180
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:52,380
just use you just use knife and you give

181
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:57,750
just before little little

182
00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:00,890
cause you just use the glue and it is

183
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,960
okay so it looks like if no one had

184
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:07,650
manipulated it and those anti tempering

185
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:10,290
systems are of the caucus but truthfully

186
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,720
that you have a ram memory you have the

187
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,599
internal configuration of the device we

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,120
have an internal battery and what

189
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,150
happens with this anti-tamper system

190
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,400
when you open the box the way the switch

191
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:26,100
is open and in general as it is a

192
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,439
volatile memory everything is destroyed

193
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,470
everything is disappearing

194
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,170
we need several because the first one we

195
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,540
will have the Tampa the Tampa solution

196
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,030
and then you have to have a clip you

197
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:43,050
have to use a small piece of iron

198
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:46,740
whatever to hack to have as a hacker to

199
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:52,020
behave as a hacker and then seal they

200
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:54,720
are to protect the well it's just that

201
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:59,610
when you access you cannot have the

202
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,610
possibility of getting the well

203
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,710
guarantee or it is if they say well this

204
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,260
is not valid if you have manipulated it

205
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,390
you cannot repair it the manufacturer

206
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,040
will repair it this is what the

207
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,500
manufacturer guarantees so it doesn't

208
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,980
matter and then we have protections with

209
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,960
a resin epoxy resin here the circuits

210
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,900
are protected it looks like a good

211
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:26,640
system but it is done in general with

212
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:29,640
glue or whatever that are not for that

213
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,689
purpose and here you have to think and

214
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,650
it is to do it with care in the case of

215
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,730
silicon

216
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:41,910
well you you have to take it in a very

217
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:44,790
very subtle mode I could use a hairdryer

218
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,910
you could use a blower you could use

219
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:51,689
something and it is doing it in a very

220
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:55,790
very subtle way to do it with care to do

221
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,790
it with love to touch it gently

222
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:11,809
of course and here we have painting to

223
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:14,599
identify here well as this red color

224
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:17,839
it's a suffering thing David mentioned

225
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:22,519
this before and he mentioned cold war

226
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:26,419
and that too graphic device is painted

227
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:29,269
in red not to have asked to allow us to

228
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:32,660
access to it that comes from the crypto

229
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:37,429
museum very interesting page if you want

230
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:41,868
to analyze encrypted devices you could

231
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:45,919
invest hours days because thanks to the

232
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:49,279
crypto museum to this picture and thanks

233
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:54,199
David for making me think about it it's

234
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:57,139
like the seed of evil okay and here we

235
00:12:54,199 --> 00:13:00,169
have here the circuit and now what we

236
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:04,489
have to do is to see Ward's what the

237
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:06,649
heck what's inside we have the chips and

238
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:09,079
so on and we have to identify the

239
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:12,410
integrated circuits first of all that

240
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:15,618
are the core of it and then those

241
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:18,949
integrated circuits are those that will

242
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:23,929
tell us what's inside and then you can

243
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:28,639
see here the picture of the art you boy

244
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:34,009
inside the advantages that we have all

245
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:38,539
the information necessary about it in

246
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:43,489
some cases the circuits have been erased

247
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:46,220
in other picture you see how they have

248
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,589
taken others and they had just they're

249
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,230
just destroyed with the reference just

250
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:53,720
scratching scratching on top of it and

251
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,049
then in those cases this is going to be

252
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,439
tough but we need to measure volt

253
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:03,169
voltage we have to know where everything

254
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:06,349
is connected we have to look for data

255
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:11,419
sheets that it is important you have to

256
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:13,220
do it with gut feeling intuition because

257
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:15,679
in general you think how it's been

258
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,139
connected you know about earthing you

259
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:21,499
have to take the data sheet of the

260
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:23,659
manufacturing and there are chips were

261
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:26,539
there are no information it happens with

262
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:28,220
Chinese hardware the copies they do all

263
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:32,179
the time and there is no information

264
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,399
about it so there are chips without any

265
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:37,970
reference because that's a pirate copy

266
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,499
of one that is of course approved of

267
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,589
course there is no information about it

268
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:47,089
and there is this is a nice way to steal

269
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:49,239
things and as you see it we have to say

270
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,220
if this is an integrated system a

271
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:56,239
microcontroller and so on and so forth

272
00:14:52,220 --> 00:15:00,499
we need to know and we have to test and

273
00:14:56,239 --> 00:15:03,739
the test pads are as we see here

274
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:06,499
perfectly defined those are the circuits

275
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:11,389
you have inside all the hardware in

276
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:14,779
general that will have different pads to

277
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:19,519
test this at the manufacturing plant or

278
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:22,489
it is what so the technique the experts

279
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,999
from the company do when they have a

280
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:28,069
client service offered to repair the

281
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:29,980
device that's what happens

282
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:34,339
what other components are interesting

283
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:37,309
and we will know about the hardware if

284
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:40,669
there are antennas well of course if you

285
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:43,969
have antennas then the next thing will

286
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:46,579
be that's a radio circuit to just two

287
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:51,369
broadcasts or to download the

288
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:53,839
information so we need to know about the

289
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:56,989
regulation and here we have some quartz

290
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,789
crystals I mentioned before they had

291
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:01,759
destroyed the MOX

292
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:03,859
it is not to show whatsoever it's not

293
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:08,089
done on purpose it's not I I didn't do

294
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:10,519
it myself it was like this no references

295
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,949
no nothing no reference at all and then

296
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,959
we have to all of a sudden look good say

297
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:16,160
this is a generic plate inside a

298
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,709
commercial

299
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,500
who could say this is a generic purpose

300
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:29,030
all the different pins of the micro are

301
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:32,510
targeted towards the out going out of

302
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,939
this it is like the Arduino but it is a

303
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,340
different ID the oscillator is at 18

304
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,130
megahertz I will have an idea on the

305
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,950
circuit slave velocity the speed and

306
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,370
then we have here some regulation

307
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:49,400
circuits 5 volts and here what's not

308
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:53,090
seen here it is a controller rs45 to

309
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:56,150
have an idea that you general this looks

310
00:16:53,090 --> 00:17:00,740
like a developer tool to control things

311
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:03,319
and it is what it was micro you have to

312
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,750
see what it is you have to deduct this

313
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,180
out of the pins and this is what I'm

314
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,250
still working on and I need your help if

315
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,070
you want to help me more than welcome

316
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,770
and here having identified the hardware

317
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,869
and the connections that comes from an

318
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,990
article that's very interesting

319
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:24,679
regarding reversing and hardware hacking

320
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:27,800
of the alarm system I have deleted here

321
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,930
the names and I am not mentioning brands

322
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,149
here you can imagine of course but I've

323
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,040
deleted the names I would like to say

324
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,610
that you have to take this with a pinch

325
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,480
of salt

326
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:41,449
it looks retorted but take care of the

327
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,450
information and what we convey because

328
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,550
in general hackers could just go and

329
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:50,150
they could destroy the alarms while

330
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,610
trying to breach and trying to for

331
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:56,330
instance trespass and get into your

332
00:17:52,610 --> 00:18:00,800
place if you have an alarm so and it is

333
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:02,929
not good to go against companies based

334
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,510
in our country they have big lawyers and

335
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,830
they could file a claim and we'll see

336
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,980
what happens perhaps nothing will happen

337
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,629
but in the end to be years and years

338
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,320
really and sorry for say that up

339
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:18,080
and then you have a the alarm and we

340
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,908
have here and tennis and

341
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,010
we could have an idea unless at what's

342
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:25,549
working what's not working you have here

343
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:30,140
the idea and the interface we mentioned

344
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:33,590
before the modem is a 3G modem there is

345
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,340
a SIM card inside and we see there is a

346
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:43,519
network port here we have here the power

347
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:45,678
system and we have it's a bit image but

348
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,500
this is a tab of switch and when you

349
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,139
open this it is totally destroyed it is

350
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,500
totally erased no information available

351
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:57,918
when you open this and if we've done our

352
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:02,570
homework well and I mentioned our Jewboy

353
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:05,450
and the video games this is the original

354
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,668
circuit from the documentation we got

355
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,840
who have to be very patient to where the

356
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:15,169
tester very patient patiently we have

357
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,840
drawn everything and you see there is a

358
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:21,200
micro processor as we see here we have

359
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,230
this LED plate that's terminating

360
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,230
through the boss with the micro system

361
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:31,820
where the power system we have the

362
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:35,510
batteries we have another thing and we

363
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:38,750
have here - what it was connected the

364
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:41,210
the hardware is already there there has

365
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,940
been reverted so to speak we know that

366
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:47,840
it works it starts working properly and

367
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:50,059
well we say great fantastic and well now

368
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,789
you can just download information from

369
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:57,980
the website you know how it is and now

370
00:19:52,789 --> 00:20:00,799
how to facilitate the developing and we

371
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,950
have to upload something because there

372
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,918
is the interface we have some

373
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:10,010
programmers interfaces and we could do

374
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:15,620
it directly but the thing is that normal

375
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:19,580
is to have the bootloader and this

376
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:22,020
developer developer IDE and it is

377
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,620
important

378
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:30,300
and the boots larger we will see the

379
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:32,969
bootloader is to load software and the

380
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,610
device in the firmware and then the

381
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,100
bootloader is the first one to start the

382
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,979
first to start is a bootloader it

383
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,189
communicates through the USB port and

384
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,160
they say I've got the order of

385
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:50,340
reprogramming things so ago I move up to

386
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,429
the main program in the case of a thing

387
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:56,399
it is connected to the computer they say

388
00:20:53,429 --> 00:21:00,380
well okay send me the program and I will

389
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:04,590
write the boot loader is one of those

390
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:07,850
executable type viruses and when will

391
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:12,110
happens what happens is that if there is

392
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:16,919
no order to reprogram main things then

393
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:23,370
load will reduce the capacity of the

394
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:27,110
main program okay so it could be very

395
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:32,010
obvious because we used to work here and

396
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:37,320
terabytes megabytes but the truth is

397
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:43,250
that those micro things they have I'm

398
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:48,300
talking about 20 1024 bytes of around

399
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:51,720
350 or 300 300 characters 250 characters

400
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:54,899
of RAM memory so you are destroying a

401
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,020
quarter of the system and then we have

402
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:00,650
to do it gently and don't forget that

403
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,770
those are not micro processors those are

404
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,710
microcontrollers

405
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:08,639
those are single tasks and things single

406
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:12,020
task devices you cannot say okay or you

407
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:16,710
would put it at rest and this will stop

408
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:21,210
there are other multi task things but

409
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:23,040
for that we have to say that my I have

410
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,300
to take rest in the evening so I haven't

411
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,270
started yet

412
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,178
oh the multitask things when you're

413
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:32,539
programming this

414
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:36,289
don't forget there might be mistakes

415
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:44,979
there people turn destroying the round

416
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:44,979
memory and they say you have reserved

417
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:53,599
2048 bytes of RAM and there is no RAM

418
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:58,999
left not enough here it is Arduino and

419
00:22:53,599 --> 00:23:00,309
we have to say hi world with have used

420
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:05,149
Arduino

421
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:06,889
raise your hands many for those no no I

422
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:10,518
do you know I will explain quickly what

423
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:13,849
it is the way it works we see here there

424
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:16,249
IDE we see the integrated development

425
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:18,649
environment here the way it works and we

426
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:21,379
have the setup on the loop the setup is

427
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:27,349
the code we will use that is used only

428
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:29,718
once and it's always used to have to

429
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:32,749
stop because if not it's in loop it will

430
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:35,809
be once and again executed setup is

431
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:37,999
executed only once we have to initialize

432
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:40,489
variables we have communication cores

433
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:42,469
who have pens and will the look and

434
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:43,969
there are several functions we can

435
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:46,219
develop new functions naturally be

436
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:48,799
curved and so on we're talking about RAM

437
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:51,619
or capacity but we have to have the

438
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,019
economy of the code we have to try to do

439
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:56,928
it gently to do it well

440
00:23:54,019 --> 00:24:00,830
as I said before but we're 10 we have

441
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:03,649
the specifically library for our doing

442
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,918
so we're not going to invent the wheel

443
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:11,418
here so we based on the arguments we

444
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:14,839
have on the screen to do a print and say

445
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:16,909
hey world hello world so it the example

446
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:18,619
is very silly maybe but the first time

447
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:21,440
you take the video whether your console

448
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:24,259
and your type hello or nesto and you

449
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,909
turn it on you say oh my god that's

450
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:31,009
beautiful ok now we have the console

451
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:32,989
that has been hacked that council says

452
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:35,869
to you hi how are you

453
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:39,109
and then of course you can use it for

454
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:40,510
for more useful things instead of being

455
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:43,780
there just playing with there

456
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,900
so why what do we use this for the first

457
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:51,700
thing that came that came to our mind

458
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:54,690
was a password manager through hardware

459
00:24:51,700 --> 00:25:00,280
blue team as we call it so we have a

460
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:05,980
menu with the passwords so I've always

461
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:09,010
felt bad when customer asked me to come

462
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,799
up with the secure password I'm always

463
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:15,220
there and there's always looking you

464
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:18,700
maybe just you know like eavesdropping

465
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,980
sort of sort of speaking so what we can

466
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:26,890
do I said to myself let's see how this

467
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:32,890
behaved losses USB so we have this

468
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:35,470
little menu with passwords on the screen

469
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:39,160
acting as a keyboard that this is our

470
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:42,429
customer the server password so if you

471
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:45,940
put it there and those looking at you

472
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:47,490
just pulled a console from his pocket

473
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:51,400
and he's going to be looking at you like

474
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:53,919
puzzled but the practical thing is if

475
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:59,850
you lose this if you don't know where it

476
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:03,970
is you can read it and passwords will be

477
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:05,949
stored altogether so this is a security

478
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,890
breach that is very very important

479
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:13,470
someone can open it to see password so

480
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:18,880
what we can do is to activate the switch

481
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:21,580
to avoid reading so to protect it so

482
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,790
it's very useful to use this calculator

483
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:28,418
this fuse calculator probably someone

484
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:31,090
knows about this but this is smart you

485
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:33,130
can use this fuse calculator I don't

486
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:38,199
know if you can read this on the screen

487
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:41,860
but we have a serial promotes a try it's

488
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,990
a little bit bizarre but at the end of

489
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,600
the day what this is telling you that

490
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:50,140
you're not going to be able to read this

491
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,520
and this is an additional security

492
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,160
feature

493
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,190
you could use the my curve the marker

494
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,490
when we read the rhyme you can do that

495
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:03,100
but you will have to invest a great deal

496
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:11,350
to get your passwords from a video

497
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:15,870
console so let me show you the what the

498
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,870
code is life actually

499
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:27,130
I'm not going to talk much about coats

500
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,740
but if you're interested in codes you

501
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:37,850
will have my Twitter account you can ask

502
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:41,870
me no problem answer this to you so we

503
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:44,270
had this with the pages you can you can

504
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,179
include your username but this is like

505
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,370
up there like a keyboard user name

506
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,860
password or just the password this is

507
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:57,679
what you can get if you use this so what

508
00:27:51,860 --> 00:28:01,729
we do what we can do is so we we have

509
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:04,970
this C made menu so if you have doubts

510
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:09,340
or questions you can download is this is

511
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:12,890
easy to do so you have a set of that is

512
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:16,129
secured this is an emergency button if

513
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,990
you see this could be stolen from you so

514
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:23,210
you will have your video console that

515
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:30,190
will be blocked you will have a pin when

516
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:30,190
you want to open it

517
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:52,920
No okay so we have the this feature

518
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:56,370
Center keyboard that the code is very

519
00:28:52,920 --> 00:29:01,560
long so we have keyboard libraries so

520
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:04,739
that behaves like a keyboard USB that

521
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,780
we've been discussing before so we're

522
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,470
not gonna go into all the details about

523
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:13,800
that this is nice for all passwords I

524
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:16,590
think it is useful for my job is useful

525
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,169
I use this to store all my customers

526
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:22,280
passwords it might be silly might seem

527
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:24,690
silly but I have a long list of secured

528
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,270
password if someone is looking at you

529
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:29,330
from behind this is not okay but you can

530
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:34,650
do this because this is easy to do and

531
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:38,189
and good to them and then we have bad

532
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:40,440
USB with a menu so that you can choose

533
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:44,370
the attack on it then in a dynamic way

534
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,380
so it's it's nice so we decided to

535
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:50,250
create a demo

536
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:53,220
I've never liked live demos I've always

537
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:58,440
recorded them beforehand so let's try to

538
00:29:53,220 --> 00:30:10,620
do that live anyways here let's see what

539
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:14,930
it what it is like both Blue Team and

540
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,929
Red Team okay here we are

541
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:23,750
this is the camera the first thing is we

542
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,820
will do I mean we will show you the blue

543
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:28,190
team for you to see the password

544
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,020
management and how it works this is the

545
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:36,679
video control which is very nice

546
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:40,309
actually can you see that yep password

547
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:43,130
and then you get the pin number I mean

548
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:45,740
the number so you have different

549
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:53,120
possibilities up down right left

550
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:56,000
whatever you push enter and you see here

551
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,169
the menu with clients customer servers

552
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,170
and Twitter

553
00:31:52,110 --> 00:32:00,939
so we log on Twitter I created an

554
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:07,390
account that I will delete after that so

555
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:11,200
we did 2019 um I'm very boring to come

556
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:14,110
up with names but maybe nobody thought

557
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:18,160
about this name so we connect the USB

558
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:23,760
and then we connect the USB to the

559
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,760
computer yeah here's the port

560
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:39,920
so when we have when I have many screens

561
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:44,490
I always lose my point there mouse so

562
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:47,580
password we promise as a keyboard so we

563
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:53,820
decided to use it as a keyboard enter so

564
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:57,600
when we hit that the key will see that

565
00:32:53,820 --> 00:33:00,330
so so you would write your password here

566
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,889
and then you are in but this is not the

567
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,740
case I don't know exactly what is

568
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:07,740
happening now probably the cable was now

569
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:11,120
well connected it was my mistake I'm

570
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:16,620
sorry about that says the speaker so

571
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,209
automatic the password login the now I

572
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:23,760
see on the screen that this is not

573
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:25,559
correct but believe me I tested this

574
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,450
this earlier this morning at 2:00 a.m.

575
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:32,250
and it was working okay but this is life

576
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:35,610
I'll do that again later no problem as

577
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:38,340
you can see the password accepted even

578
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,290
if it was not valid because it was told

579
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,809
in my bubble phone the other day and I

580
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:45,360
decided to change all passwords and

581
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:49,770
probably this is the reason why who

582
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:56,100
knows that and then we have bad USB this

583
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:59,879
this section here you see you see a pin

584
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,790
is requested and you have several test

585
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,540
Windows Linux and different kinds of

586
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:08,989
attacks to be added here let's see if it

587
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,989
works now

588
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:52,100
we hear totally appetizing okay let's

589
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,100
see if it works now

590
00:34:54,699 --> 00:35:09,720
I never get any more okay okay here we

591
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,110
are

592
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:15,430
cam

593
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,430
other cameras here

594
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:25,869
believe me I go crazy when I have

595
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:31,180
several screens in front of me believe

596
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:34,270
me so here you are it's a little blur

597
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:37,118
but then we have Windows with a notepad

598
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:40,930
line notes with the notepad for Windows

599
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:43,840
and for Linux so you start you execute

600
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:46,419
you note and then that's it

601
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,580
that's that should be like that as

602
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,830
simple as that

603
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,830
let's try once again

604
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,480
Linus notepad

605
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:12,370
as you can see I was going slowly I

606
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:19,210
don't know why it's an upper case the

607
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:21,870
advantage is that you can repeat it yeah

608
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,410
it was upper case because I hit that

609
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,230
diamond key

610
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,480
so it's like a keyboard if you block

611
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:40,540
upper case well your upper case well the

612
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:43,030
clip will be blocked motive had the wand

613
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:45,160
up the notepad in order to have an X

614
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:48,640
term and we wouldn't have a control to

615
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:52,060
execute anything we would mourn I have

616
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,830
the key upper case blocked and I'm

617
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:59,620
blocked again as you can see it works

618
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:03,400
again this is life if you want to take a

619
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:06,299
look no problem but I'll be famous after

620
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,300
that I know that

621
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:20,390
future improvement this is a good idea

622
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:22,910
in order to think towards the future and

623
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:26,390
things that can be improved it would be

624
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:29,839
interesting to have a library to manage

625
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:32,859
menus it's it's horrible it's hell to

626
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:36,710
come up with menus I really like it but

627
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:38,779
making menus and creating menus is awful

628
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,820
so the idea is to have AB library with

629
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,800
structure in order for this to be

630
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,990
scalable and to be used for the project

631
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,270
not only for those dance another idea is

632
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:50,450
to include Wi-Fi because we have testing

633
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:53,990
here so we would have wife Wi-Fi

634
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:56,450
Bluetooth as the microchip in order to

635
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:58,779
store things house make it scalable not

636
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:02,450
only use the current house Harvard but

637
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:04,160
having the possibility of enhancing it I

638
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:07,520
would like to thank all those PL the

639
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,379
people here on the screen but also these

640
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,670
people are at the first rail so thank

641
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:17,000
you for having proposed improvement and

642
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,859
thank you for putting up with me it is

643
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,130
very difficult sometimes I know that I'm

644
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:24,589
a little bit of a freaky guy but I know

645
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:28,480
it's hard to put up with me thank you

646
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:31,670
and thank you all very much for having

647
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,339
come to Rudy it's an honor for me to see

648
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:39,140
how many people sitting together for me

649
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:41,599
so now if you have questions let's move

650
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,098
to questions now if you want to ask

651
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,030
questions or car or ask for

652
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:46,030
clarifications

653
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:56,169
so if you have questions please go to

654
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:58,759
the mics one on both sides of the stage

655
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:03,100
if you have questions for your nest oh

656
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,100
yeah there's one question here

657
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:14,880
the question I wanted to ask you is that

658
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:18,899
you had something to avoid accessing

659
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,450
your memory for not having password so

660
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:24,980
if you had if you have this sorted out

661
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:28,558
before if you cipher and decipher them

662
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:31,410
the thing is that you will be able to

663
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,599
code them and to have a very basic

664
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,210
system but the basic system will not

665
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,700
support other things so the encrypting

666
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,920
and encrypting thing you will have I

667
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,720
mean for you to use this you will have a

668
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,880
password and you will have to store it

669
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,919
somewhere and the problem would be

670
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,690
longer and but the problem will stay

671
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:55,829
there so the best thing is to use

672
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:58,619
something to avoid and prevent people

673
00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:03,420
from entering instead of encrypting any

674
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:07,250
other question okay Ernesto thank you

675
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:12,140
very much for your participation and for

676
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:12,140
sharing with us thank you
