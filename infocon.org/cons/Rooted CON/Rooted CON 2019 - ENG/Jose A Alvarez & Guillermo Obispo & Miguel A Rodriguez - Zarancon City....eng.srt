is not a city we talk about protecting

33
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:15,010
the polity talking about protecting the

34
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:21,310
city because we'll have to help you

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:24,609

routine this conference which is very

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,470
give to something

and then we have industry and safety

41
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,019
suppliers are either half perished

42
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:41,208
services there are no friends we and

43
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,760
well standardized or give him their

44
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:46,730
occasional services but there is no

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:52,810
comprehensive package of services to do

46
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:54,970
and that's what we want to focus on

47
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,220
construction on defense and that will be

48
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:03,620
in the approachable harmonization the

49
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:06,650
first of all before we continue the

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,918
we thought that the approach will be

59
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:43,000
rather we see too much rather because

60
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,000
when we come to reach it go

61
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:50,770

thing genocide administration in

79
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,419
cybersecurity

80
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:53,650
my name is bespoke look most of you who

81
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:53,650
may know me me know me as really Twitter

82
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,700
or anything but these are not very

83
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,359
skilled I've got should be a hacker

84
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:07,039
right it'd be okay we have Harper's

85
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,890
amongst us they usually you know

86
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,729
recognized because usually they have fun

87
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:18,560
no matter centre home they have

88
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:21,050
but like lava even in me and they eat

89
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,740
children forgotten first so he follows a

90
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:28,160
hot girl nasi Hakka things just watch

91
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,980
important which is very analyte or uses

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,200
Queens

93
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,360
but block round and let's just move a

94
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,690
draw and I will think of how to ignore

95
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,990
not easy by attacking cureless people

96
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,670
racket in fragile places that may be

97
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,180
simple to attack because they give me

98
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:49,670
prestige money or because they bug me

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,140
so I could do those kind of things and

100
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,350
maybe you haven't thought about it but

101
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:58,190
were you leave there are these policies

102
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:01,820
and cities that are careless and fragile

103
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,770
and in theory we could have half that I

104
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,400
just wanted to wanted you to remember

105
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:10,700
that idea just in case I use a lighter

106
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,520
okay so my name is Jose Alvarez

107

108

I'm also here as a team member if a

113
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,020
thunk on technology team giving our

114
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,780
perspective on the building part or how

115
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:40,049
to build systems and there any safe

116
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:42,510
networks it's cute not work so well is

117
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,900
thong Kong you may wonder some of you

118

may be ruling it please let me know the

119

results you get

120
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:56,780
we're quite lucky because we are just in

121
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:59,850
between two cities were some of the most

122
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,770
famous artist has country were born he

123
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,870
is that idea so that you can talk about

124
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,940
it amongst yourselves most prolific in

125
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,830
as a fellow see if you can tell who

126
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,669
comes from water on it and who comes

127
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,419
from that author

128
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:14,280
so thank approximately a hundred

129
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,919
thousand inhabitants enough me

130
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,080
remarkable say in me we were saying this

131
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:26,419
makes it a bit of an uncomfortable

132
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:29,430
situation because it's a no-no the

133
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,979
service is not provided by the regional

134
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,630
government they don't have to bother

135
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,729
much but when they are bigger and

136
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,710
habitants at least they have a budget

137
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:45,930
and they have staff and has been rockin

138
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:48,750
horse neighing this middle sized user is

139
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,520
a complicated one we have some 500

140
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:54,210
public employees that I have to remember

141
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,490
that we have to provide service to out

142
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,530
of those 500 employees there are 10

143
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:02,340
people

144
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:08,700
part in charge of all the technological

145
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:11,880
stuff and among those ten maybe matters

146
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,969
the one tour not with in charge of

147
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,450
taking care of security because we are

148
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:26,790
have a certain size we also have to take

149
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:28,770
of the citizens sensors and those sort

150
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:32,070
of things and as mechanical saying we

151
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:37,799
have many more things the Internet of

152
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:41,099
Things with traffic lights cameras /

153
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,870
security all of that next times more

154
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,230
complicated for us we don't have that

155
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,880
many resources we don't have these

156
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:52,350
pressures and this is the scenario for

157
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,689
the icon so let's start

158
00:08:52,350 --> 00:09:00,690
what could a hacker do somebody who

159
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:04,890
wants to attack that icon just the first

160
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:08,190
thing we could do is those kind no ports

161
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:10,710
looking for faster access probably call

162
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,310
a finger premature this is something

163
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,290
basic we need to be great there are

164
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,439
stars to get here what I need to say

165
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:26,760
with business hours the holes are

166
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:28,740
exposed any person who studies computing

167
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,860
and buys a book from Pavlov on solid I

168
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,990
was probably around good to know to

169
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,540
begin with fingerprinting but I could

170
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:41,540
also sort of up the bed look for

171
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,540
vulnerabilities

172
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:51,300
are the physical intrusion techniques it

173
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,650
is very complex as you can tell

174
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,490
accessing City Hall and perhaps

175
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:59,949
introducing the pendrive with a

176
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:03,750
malicious software and you can imagine

177
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,750
the type of situation with describing

178
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,050
okay I'm not worried because in we've

179
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,439
done homework work hard and we have

180
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,540
developed a network and security

181
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,940
architecture which is very proposed but

182
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,520
there are fearful years we have plenty

183
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,460
of things to do and a business is asking

184
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,220
from our Lord cyber system we have a lot

185
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:31,500
of budget because the area where we have

186
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:35,290
a very close by a high-speed train

187
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:41,500
station and so we receive a lot of money

188
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:51,930
and all of our services are loud we work

189
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:54,160
with everything as a service and the

190
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,910
perimeter and the interconnection

191
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:05,079
perimeter and we have an internet

192
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:07,719
connection right sar airs and I make a

193
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:12,430
difference between SCADA and Internet of

194
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:15,310
Things the 30 30 networks at once with a

195
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,569
user traffic and the clean ones are the

196
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,130
other ones and for that we'll have a

197
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,310
control system in which the clean

198
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:24,610
networks basically have some controls

199
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:28,680
that are based on the fact that only

200
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,680
known traffic has to go through those

201
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,469
networks will have a behavior and other

202
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,540
systems to detect anomalies because we

203
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,540
don't have that many employees well it's

204
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:45,939
relatively easy to detect them so we

205
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:49,089
have to implement a a lakh and ciphering

206
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,980
or encryption that's room for any

207
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,709
communication that we have so I'm sorry

208
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,410
but you're gonna have a hard time ok no

209
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:58,560
problem if we can't anyway there we're

210
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:03,750
going to know the typical

211
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,750
framework for exploit of vulnerabilities

212
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:18,160
what the low-hanging fruit but we can

213
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,440
also be more efficient and I think that

214
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,770
that I can probably will have critical

215
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,709
infrastructure supplies water

216
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,870
traffic lights perhaps we could also try

217
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:30,640
to do an attack on some physical

218
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,480
infrastructure that would be bad so

219
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,480
that's always an option

220
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:41,040
well in this case as we've tried to

221
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,680
mitigate this type of attack with the

222
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,420
same idea that we are a mechanical heart

223
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,630
described there so much because it's

224
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,209
trendy but because we are convinced that

225
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:55,020
we must provide as many services as we

226
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:57,660
can in all of the infrastructures that

227
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:01,079
we can always to have them as a service

228
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,630
if we can find the solution of software

229
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,830
as a service we will prioritize it not

230
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,520
because it's trendy but because we

231
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,620
because we're talking about

232
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,720
infrastructure so we want to reduce the

233
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,180
software and middleware layer that would

234
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,700
entail a lot of work in terms of our

235
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,959
party and so on so we're going to

236
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,970
fortify all of our equipment using the

237
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,660
indications of the guidelines of the ACC

238
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,670
and I'm sure you're all familiar with

239
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,880
but you all know how valuable there are

240
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:35,430
some are complex but they're it's a

241
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,380
valuable source that we make the most of

242
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:42,989
and we try to apparently touch regularly

243
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,150
all of our machines always thinking in

244
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:48,030
them and always with the priorities are

245
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:50,430
from the perimeter to the center so all

246
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,220
the services that are directed to the

247
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,849
outside world have to be updated and to

248
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,470
the world special thought to our

249
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,290
administrators that will usually be good

250
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,060
but have important privileges and

251
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:09,060
therefore we have to focus on them so

252
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:13,560
we're going to focus our education you

253
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,540
know that Google was showing off saying

254
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,280
that they had sorted all of the

255
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:24,160
efficient problem

256
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:31,800
credentials is the strategy after the

257
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:36,939
operations we have an active directory

258
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:40,329
make things hard for whoever wants to

259
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:44,430
give us trouble is the N ApS so that an

260
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:48,130
administration administrator is it is

261
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:50,859
and I hope that in your organization

262
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:54,090
reverse not a single password that gives

263
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,560
access to everything and in there P aw

264
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,840
also for administrators when they do

265
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,880
there are taxes who do it in devoted

266
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,300
stations and with that we are going to

267
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,480
make life much harder for our hacker

268
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:12,959
friend and we're gonna make things hard

269
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:17,140
for him and we forget something else

270
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,970
that I was forgetting it's to try not to

271
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,230
make things they say for whoever's

272
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:25,870
coming to attack us or something simple

273
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:30,850
as the fact that our services do not

274
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:33,970
confess the PHP or they have other

275
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:37,270
they're using they do not confess it

276
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:40,060
quickly that's very easy to do and if

277
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,850
you're on the other side it's always

278
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:47,050
possible to find out which version you

279
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:50,530
use it no no doubt but it takes out okay

280
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,819
so they won't let us in that way so

281
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:55,850
whatever

282
00:15:51,820 --> 00:16:01,730
all of our City Council's they publish

283
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:05,600
their the way we always say Congress or

284
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:08,180
to SQL or injections the techniques are

285
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,760
they cross high-tech script and as they

286
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,219
were saying actually do a

287
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,689
man-in-the-middle and goes beyond that

288
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:22,730
and see if we can get something out of

289
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:25,330
there that's also technique to me or

290
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:28,040
steal credentials I'm gonna ask my

291
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:30,320
prophet my colleagues to go a bit faster

292
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,469
we ran out of time no problem I'm not

293
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,780
worried in that I can't we've done our

294
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,180
homework our shop with development

295
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,770
there's a lot of talk about that second

296
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,310
but we've been working for years on

297
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:46,210
secure development design privacy

298
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,209
everything's under control

299
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:57,380
minimum security controls a wasp's it

300
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:01,390
has to be there we talk a lot about

301
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,390
training but the training is

302
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,250
organizations and then the testing as

303
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,200
part of the lifecycle or the software

304
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,089
development security testing is not just

305
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,550
enough to imagine that things are done

306
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:16,780
you have to test them or it are the

307
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,780
final control stage

308
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,500
so we've said we are in the clouds so we

309
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,740
need to have specific measures for the

310
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,740
cloud

311
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:35,310
WAF and Cosby Identity Management that's

312
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,320
very important we have a that completely

313
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:40,389
concur in the management of privileged

314
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:47,280
accounts beyond the measures the hotel

315
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:49,600
has mentioned the APA all critical

316
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,270
account that were worried about them for

317
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,090
data protection detail P and in some

318
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:59,970
cases encryption whatever the data

319
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:04,209
required but the LP as a fundamental a

320
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:08,410
production measure money not okay so we

321
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,360
will the closed circle nice aim if

322
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:15,340
that's something they did more and more

323
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:19,300
let's think about users I do social

324
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:23,230
engineering extract and this is always

325
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:27,000
the easiest the softest or the weakest

326
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:30,220
link is that many yourself fishing or

327
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,380
specific software that they might be

328
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:37,720
using I guess something of what we show

329
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,930
is perhaps being yours into the cause of

330
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,210
those of you that do you say you do not

331
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,490
live in that we probably care to it

332
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:49,410
we could probably get to there and from

333
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:54,309
then to escalate

334
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:58,080
so what have we proposed defend

335
00:18:54,309 --> 00:19:02,040
ourselves from this sort of attack well

336
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:05,490
operatives is them are right the

337
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:08,980
fortified they are aware that it's

338
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:11,710
difficult to apply hundred percent of

339
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,570
the CC and Moncayo times and for

340
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,799
everything to people working but we can

341
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:23,799
apply it and partially we are careful

342
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:26,770
with the potential names of fishing in a

343
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,240
couple of weeks we're going to take my

344
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:31,150
search against that would minimize the

345
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,590
install software the more so furthermore

346
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:38,980
updating work with hard harder it it's

347
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:41,110
going to be the ideal scenario yes it's

348
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:46,000
just the operating system and our

349
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:50,590
browser and to keep those those options

350
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,140
are updated in the antivirus everybody's

351
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,959
aware that you cannot live with a basic

352
00:19:53,140 --> 00:20:00,700
protection it takes money but life is

353
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:03,520
hard and something very important our

354
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:07,480
users are not administrators I guess

355
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,770
that's how it is in Europe and in your

356
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,840
city councils our users are not

357
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:17,679
administrators and our administrators

358
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:23,850
are no losers they do not serve strange

359
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:27,700
wait pages with administrators and

360
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:32,770
credentials or right and something to do

361
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:35,059
with mobility and we we bet on mobile

362
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:40,200
has become

363
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:42,809
to our double authentication double

364
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:47,279
two-factor authentication this is the

365
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:51,149
technical scenario the one we have to go

366
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:55,799
to word many talks about how to break

367
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:58,590
the passwords and maybe tweet saying it

368
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,779
doesn't matter how go to your passport

369
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,270
you can break it in and that's true at

370
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:05,700
our firm we must have a two-factor

371
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:10,230
authentication well having heard all of

372
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:11,220
this if I was where an attacker he meant

373
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,640
to attract tarancón

374
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:18,210
we have to to the measures are perhaps

375
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,179
not complete and there but ever probably

376
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:24,000
much easier places to break and they're

377
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:27,000
there in your city hold the ones who

378
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,580
said who work in to the halls or provide

379
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,070
service or you enjoy the success from my

380
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,070
calls is there any hacker in the room

381
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:41,880
they're very shy when I just think about

382
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:45,559
it even if you're not much fun think

383
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,779
which one would be easier to attack

384
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:53,178
either like that I call the mother to

385
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:55,789
come and attack any other public body or

386
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:59,600
City Council that perhaps is not

387
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:59,600
implementing all of these things

388
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,230
so to summarize and as a conclusion we

389
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:09,539
want to give you a number of key items

390
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:12,350
increase the visibility of your internal

391
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:16,549
and produced

392
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:21,168
the attack surface and then some a

393
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:22,970
minimum control to implement in local

394
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:26,780
government it's very important to have

395
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:30,530
this minimum base of controls compared

396
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:32,330
to what the citizen and the propulsion

397
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,059
will be there are small organizations

398
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:38,059
that cannot even consider the study or

399
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:39,889
the debate so rather than having a basic

400
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:42,770
line of controls that will generate

401
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:45,500
services packages in the sexual which

402
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:48,730
within what we have said had they does

403
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,230
not exist today to be coverage to these

404
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,240
local governments which in fact our

405
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,490
small organizations are not so different

406
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,309
from a national so when you talk about

407
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:01,190
the information security anatomies we

408
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:05,270
have to take this a value change into

409
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,760
account that is ecosystems as well and

410
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,650
finally we are not alone in Farrakhan

411
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,679
and you are not alone if you work in the

412
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:15,890
public sector last year I decided to

413
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:19,179
launch a cyber security community it's

414
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,440
called Pratap it protects public

415
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,970
administrations and make you know give

416
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,720
you support in any community and even

417
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:31,510
been working in a number of topics that

418
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:35,659
you can see listed in the slide yes the

419
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:39,020
community was set up in 2018 some crazy

420
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:41,870
guys joined because we thought that gave

421
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,629
meaning to our lives we all have we all

422
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:47,030
share the same problems and we are not

423
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:49,850
sharing enough despite certain

424
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:52,250
initiatives we're not sharing enough so

425
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:55,100
there was a very quickly and internal

426
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,950
and internal forum in which all

427
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:01,870
employees because it is antenna we feel

428
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:04,630
comfortable sharing certain concerns and

429
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:08,260
and we started participated in in talks

430
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:10,600
and you know tell our ideas are very

431
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:14,049
active in social networks and this year

432
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:17,049
we've set up our web page and we're very

433
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:21,039
proud of having participated here in

434
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:24,220
this conference just to finish I see so

435
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,289
people are hungry and I'm hungry myself

436
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,370
but I wanted to say that one knows we

437
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:35,669
may be at risk challenges of next year

438
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:38,770
aims to community build a collection of

439
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:40,419
standard forms for the contracting of

440
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:45,220
services for the community so those of

441
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:47,470
you who are public employees come home

442
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,179
and since you have nothing better to do

443
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,159
I wanted to ask for something outside

444
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:52,750
it's the first time I'm here and I think

445
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,929
it will be the last but I want a picture

446
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:58,929
with you yes from I'm to show it to my

447
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:01,990
mother and we can all stand up and we

448
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:04,830
can say goodbye with the hymn of a

449
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,830
herring cone
