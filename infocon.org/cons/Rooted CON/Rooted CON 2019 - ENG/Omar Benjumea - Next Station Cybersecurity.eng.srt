1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,569
we empathically to the moon rápida I

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,770
keep you a brief introduction historical

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,780
introduction affair

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,950
the first railway that there's evidence

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,070
from is from the year 600 before Christ

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,600
in the ancient Greece and it was a six

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:24,560
kilometre section that was used to

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:31,260
transfer ships to avoid a much longer

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:33,089
serum to cybersecurity wasn't great at

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,280
the time there wasn't a concern at the

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:41,070
time plate appeared apparently they were

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,960
great in physical safety so I'm gonna

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,010
skip this slide quite quickly

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,539
I tell very terrible jokes about trains

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,420
and Greeks

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,800
I've spent a few years working in

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,739
Switzerland that since last year I've

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,218
started working in select run in this

19
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,170
company Selectron contacted me and asked

20
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,680
me whether I wanted to keep on working

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:14,070
in cybersecurity but start working in

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,670
the rail ways and it felt like a great

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,048
idea

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,840
is there anybody in the room who does

25
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,460
not like cybersecurity or trains well

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,460
then you're not in the right place so

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,979
which is this company's electron

28
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:39,449
it's a small swiss company 150 employees

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:49,619
and they develop automation elements for

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:52,170
trains they are PLC's so computers to

31
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:57,270
control applications are functions

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:02,099
within the train it's part of a bigger

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:08,250
group not grams which is a huge group

34
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:10,789
with many other companies Mina which is

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,250
a Spanish company here in Fatah they

36
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:17,099
take care of air conditioning equipment

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:25,200
ether who makes doors another one for

38
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:28,500
brakes so all the components within in

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,649
the value chain and we have passengers

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,060
and goods then train operators and

41
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,120
infrastructures in the case it would be

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:40,290
arriving in athief train builders in

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:44,549
Spain we have Talco or CAF and we would

44
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:48,810
be at the bottom as a builder component

45
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:51,290
filters so we had to come we sell our

46
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,700
products to to the companies that

47
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,489
manufacture trains and they sell it to

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,349
the operators so what am I going to

49
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,349
I'm not going to talk about the

50
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:04,980
corporate way and the webpages that they

51
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:06,869
have to sell the companies have to sell

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,750
tickets and provide information to users

53
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,450
and I'm not going to talk about the den

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,829
a a from dream Fayetteville might be of

55
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,440
some interest I'm not going to talk

56
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:19,530
about the operations part where they

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,359
there are sometimes very old material

58
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,140
where the scheduling is done of the

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,450
traffic the Train

60
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,339
traffic's where each train should be at

61
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,319
eight point in time and I'm going to

62
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,560
focus on engineering and engineering

63
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:38,518
there are two parts the signal Empire

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,440
part and the onboard system we're going

65
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:45,170
to look at signalling and then I will

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:50,640
focus on onboard systems which is what

67
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:52,048
electron develops what should we take

68
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,010
into account if we think about

69
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,530
cybersecurity in the right way world

70
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:03,410
well many things but I would like to

71
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:06,799
focus mainly on two one is automation of

72
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:09,450
Railways you all know many examples of

73
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,870
subways or tramway that work

74
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:21,209
autonomously and the same thing applies

75
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:25,560
as in cars we can go from assistants to

76
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:28,440
driver - it raineth works in a

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,480
completely integrator the automation

78
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,880
level and more relevant

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,880
is the cybersecurity going to be because

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:46,300
the potential impact will be obviously

81
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:50,030
greater and then there is another very

82
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,130
marketing like area which I'm not going

83
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,950
to mention here which is wobbly there's

84
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,800
a service and it's very trendy and what

85
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:00,080
it generates is a need for

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,530
interconnectivity in vehicles and trains

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,300
that in their past were not supposed

88
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,919
that we're not going to be connected to

89
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,380
external networks but there's an

90
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,130
increasing need for that to change and

91
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,490
to have interconnectivity be it to

92
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:22,460
provide services to customers or

93
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:27,010
passengers to get higher invoicing or to

94
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:29,930
do predictive maintenance and other

95
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:34,190
functions that may need to be

96
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:37,430
implemented so we're going to move on to

97
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:43,670
signalling what signaling in the world

98
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:46,570
of trains and what's it for initially

99
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,570
that didn't exist

100
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:57,210
until the karmic rail disaster happened

101
00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:00,690
this was in Ireland in the 19th century

102
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,250
it was say at the end of the 19th

103
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,430
century it was a train that was

104
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:10,460
struggling to go uphill and they had to

105
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:14,060
stop it and the passengers on the back

106
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:17,630
wagons had to go to the head wounds and

107
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,820
but Davos survivors were not properly

108
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,640
stopped and they ended up crashing with

109
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:29,450
the following train coming along the

110
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,450
track so there were 80 victims and

111
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:37,080
titled victories and victims and and

112
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:39,060
many injured and that's why the

113
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:44,250
legislation was changed and technically

114
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:46,560
came about so what is it about it you

115
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:50,490
actually define a number of blocks whose

116
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:54,330
lives is determined by the breaking

117
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,919
distance that the Train needs and if

118
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,479
we're talking about a high-speed train

119
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:03,180
they're going to be longer distances

120
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:08,700
regional trains and what we do is that

121
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:11,550
if a train is on a certain block then

122
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,620
the signal will indicate red and even in

123
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:19,440
the prior block there's going to be a

124
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:24,840
limited speed allowed to guarantee that

125
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:27,930
there is the breaking space margin and

126
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,330
not only do we control when the train

127
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,300
has gone by but in each transition

128
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,150
between blocks we look at the intensity

129
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,790
of the train so that the high if there

130
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:42,030
is one wagon that's a one carriage that

131
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,010
it's at the still in the prior block

132
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:49,250
then that block still considered a

133
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,250
speeding that generated problems

134
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:57,270
just one more problem using a further

135
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,770
standardization of the right way in

136
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,250
Europe one more because that I think

137
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:07,139
like the railway societies etc and

138
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:09,300
that's when the ERT TMS was created the

139
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,030
European rail traffic management system

140
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,580
to make sure that we are all used in the

141
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,280
same way of controlling the signalling

142
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,130
system and with this it is a lot easier

143
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,830
that if I trained her to go from Spain

144
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,710
to France it it's an it can do it

145
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,979
without obstacles this standard defines

146
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,669
three levels the level one the one I've

147
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:37,830
just explained it uses the traffic

148
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:40,380
lights and the earth line to make the

149
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,060
control of when a train transferred to

150
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,180
the next block and there's not much more

151
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,939
complexity to it but if we look into

152
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,790
levels two and three which are already

153
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,100
being used with level three not yet but

154
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,860
they level two for instance the

155
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,610
high-speed train it's using the level

156
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,330
two of e r3 and as you see as many

157
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:07,010
novelty that traffic lights are no

158
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:11,310
longer needed and because there's this

159
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:15,450
signal that's sent to indicate whether

160
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,670
you can keep on advancing or you have to

161
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,980
stop and in terms of security this is

162
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,140
interesting because we see that there is

163
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,900
a certain remote connectivity or mobile

164
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:30,480
connectivity and very standard use for

165
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:32,870
this communication is the gsm-r it's

166
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,880
like the mobile ones but with some

167
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:40,860
changes then we have the your own radio

168
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,450
level which is the one that signs the

169
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:48,870
message and at the end it has in MHz to

170
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:52,700
guarantee who has generated that message

171
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,700
and then the application they are on top

172
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:01,569
gsm-r uses the same encryption

173
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,480
your TMS and that's not particularly

174
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:08,139
important because there isn't a

175
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:11,129
confidential information there to

176
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:16,860
calculate that authentication code the

177
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:20,550
MACC we used the standard cryptography

178
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,459
algorithm based on the eyes roll maybe

179
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:33,160
797 but they decided to innovate that

180
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:35,979
standard and improve it and perhaps they

181
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,639
would have a benefit from having this

182
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,649
certification on cryptology because what

183
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,170
they thought was a good idea that is to

184
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:47,589
change the original algorithm which is

185
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:49,870
using a triple desk at each level to

186
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:56,050
make it more optimal in terms of output

187
00:10:49,870 --> 00:11:00,310
by to use a triple desk only in the last

188
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:02,139
iteration what could go wrong I don't

189
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,290
know if it was last year or two years

190
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:07,810
ago but this paper was published and

191
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:12,269
it's an internet you can take a look at

192
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:15,369
it what the team did was to improve that

193
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:18,009
you can give the packages and you can

194
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,050
decipher them easily and due to the

195
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:22,689
change they did in the algorithm it's

196
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,310
quite easy to recover the key that they

197
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:27,910
use in at a particular session to

198
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:31,540
calculate the Mac code and to use it at

199
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:34,480
the end to generate a package and sign

200
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,639
it and the train to follow trying to

201
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,819
consider it valid and with that you can

202
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:44,680
tell the train to keep on going at 150

203
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:48,370
km/h even if there is a train stopped

204
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:52,449
further ahead in theory it is very easy

205
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:55,449
to do but luckily enough it's not in

206
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:58,660
practical terms is not so easy and it's

207
00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:00,819
not so because the volume the volume of

208
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,610
data is

209
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:05,839
there's not time for the whole chunk of

210
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,680
they'd had to be transferred but

211
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:13,879
nevertheless this was a an awareness

212
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:18,109
race in point in terms of the security

213
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:21,860
of the system as lessons learned I'd say

214
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,149
that if you want to do if you want to do

215
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,100
something about crystallography it's a

216
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:28,999
good idea to have an expert in the team

217
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:31,519
this is not the only problem but at the

218
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:34,519
end because of safety resources systems

219
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,999
are designed so that if communication

220
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,980
and GSM a communication stops the train

221
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:42,559
stops because there's no way to know if

222
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:46,699
the next block is busy include some you

223
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:48,860
know Messiah and beyond out the messages

224
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:52,180
that are train care to stop even though

225
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:55,850
the may not be valid training general

226
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,829
it's according to some hood will could

227
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,420
see considered those messages valid even

228
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:02,180
able to stop just in case there is some

229
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:06,240
sort of problem in calculating of Moscow

230
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:08,878
and in case of training

231
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,339
so that there won't be any maybe safety

232
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,379
issue for passing years and that means

233
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,749
that between Hyundai of service through

234
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:25,230
a train with level two or three of gsm-r

235
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:27,329
is as easy as using a GSM jammer and one

236
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,540
of the main research lines the operators

237
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:33,569
have had which is each many of the

238
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,550
paints I've got or which was many of the

239
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:37,529
paints they've got is to try to identify

240
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,240
and prevent these attacks this is

241
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:40,619
illegal by the way of you planning on

242
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,449
playing with art please take that into

243
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,829
account

244
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:48,779
here we have example of a signalling

245
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:51,449
network of a very small operator metro

246
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:54,540
operator I just found it on the on the

247
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:56,699
web actually have actually talked alone

248
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,660
but I thought it was a good example

249
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:03,868
because eventually he's just relatively

250
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,629
a small facility or insulation he's a

251
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:10,499
charmer Metro just limited to a city in

252
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:12,480
a certain complexity we tend to

253
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:14,850
extrapolate these to a national writer

254
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,540
such as RAM filling is bang the network

255
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:22,350
complexity of those systems although

256
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,179
Sigma systems is massive here I'm just

257
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,869
realizing bleach operator eventually is

258
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:29,249
different

259
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:30,770
let me implement things as I wish but

260
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:33,399
usually

261
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:36,709
in these cases we just find flat

262
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:44,260
networks without segmentation all with

263
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:49,550
various life cementation tolling with

264
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:51,439
TLS connectivity graphic location and

265
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:56,270
regarding the interlocking teams maybe

266
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:59,540
they were dating from 1950s or 60s like

267
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:02,569
a habit 8 we all coexist with current

268
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:09,170
systems but maybe from Windows Server

269
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:13,850
critics is seeing 2003 Windows XP

270
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:15,740
Windows NT or Windows 98 this has become

271
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,160
published by writer super my work and I

272
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,810
want to know of them how solid

273
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,399
they've got Windows 95 but maybe there

274
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,109
are some of them around the world who

275
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,110
have that in their signalling systems

276
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:35,010
and there's a few more chat regarding

277
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:38,820
signaling too many details and hopefully

278
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:42,350
for next year's round orphanages rooted

279
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,350
come someone could take

280
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,380
my place and become here with a cool

281
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,940
piece of research but I'm gonna talk

282
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:55,400
about onboard systems and netbooks now

283
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,560
because I think my part is even more

284
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,490
unknown for most of us at least I don't

285
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,140
have a clue until I began working a

286
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,280
select one regarding how these systems

287
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:09,890
work so first of all these are real-time

288
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,189
systems and protocols what does that

289
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,189
mean

290
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,610
in these systems you have limited time

291
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,590
in the real world environment that is

292
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,430
measured in milliseconds even though

293
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,430
with no sectors

294
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,760
we talk to these matters we talk here

295
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,290
about my descendants in our place in

296
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,110
that space you need to get a signal

297
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:40,589
prophecy to give an answer if he is

298
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:45,960
labeled a sign I'll go to a controller

299
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:48,600
or system he will stop doing the usual

300
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,670
operation operation what does that mean

301
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,690
what does it mean regarding with

302
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:58,170
security well it means that any security

303
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:01,260
measure with a security control that we

304
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,000
won't implement these systems needs to

305
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,300
be able to comply with these real-time

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:12,270
if you want to have ciphering of

307
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:14,250
Education or real-time analysis of

308
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,560
memory any sufferance you control

309
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,150
eventually we need to make sure that I

310
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:23,540
will not interfere regarding the

311
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,540
performance with real-time

312
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:30,070
as you may imagine and that is a

313
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:31,899
challenge when you begin looking at how

314
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:36,070
to implement cybersecurity in your

315
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:41,980
system eventually we'll do you well I've

316
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:44,350
got here an example of you can have a

317
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,000
look at it and this year's a computer is

318
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:50,050
it new PC generation is years a

319
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,970
prototype of a setup from there is

320
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,730
developing but he's much more powerful

321
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:59,170
regarding processing calculation than

322
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,570
former version this allows to actually

323
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,940
visualize PLC's and to have several

324
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,178
systems and several PLC's in the same

325
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,179
house

326
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:16,500
even allows having different safety

327
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,100
measures running PLC's with different

328
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,240
level of sighting another PR season

329
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:26,459
knocking if you Molly tells about these

330
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:34,440
lighter Scylla computer and we have

331
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:37,620
different types of PLC's or a train the

332
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,820
main one is the VCU the vehicle control

333
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:43,050
unit which is like the brain or the

334
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:50,700
train or even also fine PLC's dedicated

335
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:53,280
to a conditioning or to keep the Train

336
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,990
on the rails or things have to really

337
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,570
with a break it all depends on the on

338
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,640
the train driver and your parents on

339
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,559
whether they want to one single system

340
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,440
or different systems because they may

341
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,440
belong to different component factories

342
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:18,220
system as an ability and network wise

343
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:18,220
this is seems

344
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:25,900
please be redundant the team training

345
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:28,120
regarding PLC is 90 or 95 percent of the

346
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,610
time there are usually found in time and

347
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,800
availability in a strong master week

348
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,500
master format which means above systems

349
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,840
of the strong and the weak master I

350
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,840
receive it the signal saw the subsystems

351
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,659
are processing terminal but only this

352
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:48,399
one master gives an answer actually so

353
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:50,980
he is from master drops the weak Massa

354
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,930
can take his place and keep the

355
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,170
processing the same place where it was

356
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:59,280
and I can let you the side who is strong

357
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:02,980
master in the weak master in this case

358
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,220
all these systems already controlling me

359
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:09,120
each weighing a bit of everything

360
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,870
independence of the degree of automation

361
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,639
implementing the trade whether it's

362
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,949
fully autonomous have control everything

363
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:22,460
and otherwise usually control the toilet

364
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:30,059
systems the braking systems traction

365
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:30,809
system it's not like abs but he kind of

366
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,149
Avoyelles

367
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,830
wheels getting blocked because the

368
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,490
problem here says if they ever been

369
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:40,500
blocked due to the strength of the

370
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,780
friction because it's a seal against the

371
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,690
seal they will stop being wrong and that

372
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,559
is a problem with my head for the Train

373
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:51,690
those who control air conditioning

374
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:57,418
systems ORS and so on earlier forgot to

375
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:59,490
say why real-time processing is needed

376
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:02,010
and what's the reason for that it is not

377
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:06,030
always necessary or some cases if you

378
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:12,419
take the example of we need that real

379
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:16,490
time because applications to Eva pretty

380
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:20,160
much amides handsome and now scram

381
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:23,590
trying to have an application that is

382
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:28,149
receiving the speed of each axis

383
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:30,970
of the whole train wheels as well as the

384
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:33,219
dividual speed of each answers and with

385
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,470
this information they process and

386
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,350
determine which is the exact braking

387
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:41,950
power and each reply early chances and

388
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,779
these changes in milliseconds which

389
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,509
party term they need to be able to

390
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:50,620
communicate to each brake was the power

391
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:53,159
the hoist be applied before the break to

392
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,158
be optimal

393
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:58,829
taking the citizens into account how

394
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,509
they work Network Weiss and which kind

395
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:05,809
of networks can be forgiving a

396
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:05,809
train other different types of networks

397
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:14,129
one of the ones you see consists of the

398
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:17,969
vehicle network make fun one the other

399
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:19,649
above it depends on the manufacturer but

400
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:22,940
isn't at work for you implement these

401
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:27,899
tunnel systems so we found the PLC's

402
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:30,269
control systems also the input and

403
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:35,820
output systems are connect with

404
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:37,019
electronics for lights those breaks so

405
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,849
this is one of the most critical

406
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:43,979
networks in the training depending on

407
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:49,769
the track we can also find non-critical

408
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:52,879
networks also called comfort networks

409
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:56,159
that may be useful video surveillance

410
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:58,168
for information systems passengers we

411
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:05,890
need to provide Wi-Fi services

412
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:08,300
passengers things are not critical

413
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,510
they do not have the effective control

414
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:14,810
on the train then we have a specific

415
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:17,030
train bus which he said that work there

416
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:19,100
goes from end to end of the Train she's

417
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:24,200
like nothing while he concedes the

418
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:26,149
Bombers is a society cannot work there

419
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,500
is not the virus of each n Triple E now

420
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,500
there came a leak in the configuration

421
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,299
you may have fixed none of examination

422
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:41,179
devices however trained bass is a bass

423
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,679
or myself our collective whenever

424
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:44,419
they're trained configuration changes

425
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:49,490
when i learn more clarity as well as

426
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:51,940
current use whenever they pay a ratshot

427
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,740
the Train changes and that is done

428
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,400
through a process called training an

429
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,400
inauguration

430
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,380
each trend hood cheers through the rest

431
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,379
of the Train

432
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:10,370
no it's about train bars are the

433
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:12,380
information they have the configuration

434
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,780
of the underlying network the consits

435
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,560
bosses are they're connected now with

436
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:28,310
this information

437
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:31,909
each node above that keeps the databases

438
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:34,220
all the Train information so regarding

439
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:38,540
the train to apology and that is an

440
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:41,210
essential process for trainers from the

441
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:44,180
security perspective it is also one of

442
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:47,660
the processes that may help a potential

443
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:52,510
attacker to understand which is a

444
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,510
topology the exact topology of our drink

445
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:58,928
if we lived the protocols they

446
00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:03,729
physically to face link and the

447
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:07,509
protocols things really depend on the

448
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:10,240
manufacturer they decide which type of

449
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:14,740
protocols implement but you may have

450
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:18,130
protocols based on Ethernet can and also

451
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:21,070
specific protocols for the railway world

452
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:29,279
they can't want to be found we are such

453
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:29,279
as M V V V or W me TV

454
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:42,160
and depending on the protocol there may

455
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:45,080
be specific to protocols may be use

456
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,730
network level vehicle network level in

457
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,100
the training network level some of them

458
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:52,580
are specific for one or the other daniel

459
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:55,820
network and there is one that may be

460
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:58,030
used regarding train network or vehicle

461
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:03,850
network the TRDP

462
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:13,520
call is used later modifications

463
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:15,709
embodies basically uses TCP Thunder

464
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,260
Obion do need you to invest in reverse

465
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:28,160
engineering because the full

466
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:31,250
specifications regarding securities have

467
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,020
a security and its main features the

468
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,540
presentation will be real quick because

469
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:40,430
there is no authentication and telnet

470
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,980
next we Jesus a secure protocol because

471
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,660
I'm pleased you have a password and I

472
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:49,130
use a link here in this case you have

473
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:52,430
absolutely anything it's not a hater

474
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:55,820
protocol or use jobs around the one but

475
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:57,650
is one tough work the mouse with like

476
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,629
but if we look at the adder and you know

477
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,120
the former protocols will be the same

478
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:05,770
situation you know some entity show some

479
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,770
specific real examples

480
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,840
trains are now traveling around the

481
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:17,880
world which is not a factor of exactly

482
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,570
but here we have example of a European

483
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:25,550
train above we another train network

484
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:29,600
based in this case the WTB protocol

485
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:34,620
which is specific for the railway

486
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:38,040
railway world and the railway in that is

487
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:40,949
based on talent the vehicle and the

488
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,139
train buses are duplicated we have a

489
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:46,440
week master lease from master this case

490
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:51,120
we have a PLC our each end of the Train

491
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:54,510
and in the middle you may see that in

492
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,110
each vehicle there are few less systems

493
00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:01,140
and which kind of systems we have here

494
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:02,850
well here we have the VCU controllers

495
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,990
which is our which are the most remote

496
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:08,429
controllers connected without green line

497
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,710
there will be another net connection

498
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,710
cable to the graphic interface

499
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:20,360
that is shown to a driver did laughing

500
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:24,230
boom then we see a series of a specific

501
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:26,029
systems the DCU they dual control unit

502
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:29,330
which is a specific system for the whole

503
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:31,999
no programming there's not one for with

504
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:34,299
the AC the brain control unit for the

505
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:38,090
brakes and one for batteries and so on

506
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:42,679
and then we have the real each other's

507
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:45,678
now or the secret circuitry that's

508
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:51,649
connected directly to electronics with

509
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:55,789
those lights brakes or whatever another

510
00:28:51,649 --> 00:29:00,168
example here he's a European machine

511
00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:02,730
this case there is a single BCU we have

512
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:06,450
both booths of the

513
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:08,820
with machine you know true this can be a

514
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,760
living from my side or the other both

515
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:15,720
this graphic interface connected on the

516
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,050
ethernet connected to the PC um for the

517
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,050
BCU

518
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,860
we found connections who can interfaces

519
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,190
both for the vehicle was well we need to

520
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,970
connect with a different input in our

521
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:38,100
Bruno's the army real as well as I can

522
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:42,490
interface with the protocol dia

523
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,870
30 39 level so the engine to control

524
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,860
transmission and then we have a great

525
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:56,239
way to split the network trying based on

526
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:59,959
value TV for the monster

527
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:05,090
here we have an American from way has an

528
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:07,940
innovation regard to for examples here

529
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,970
we have a Wi-Fi network connected to

530
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:14,410
these and that right wreckage of VC use

531
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,410
and he seems like a good idea doesn't it

532
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:23,908
I feel very sorry when I see it and that

533
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:29,309
is working right now in some American

534
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:34,309
city here we can see that they come the

535
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:37,590
buses the vehicle bombers is based on

536
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:40,830
chun-hee we don't have a train network

537
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:44,519
he's a trunk some way which is mala and

538
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:46,799
he no case to additional authorities

539
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:50,179
connect and he's never gonna change

540
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,179
he's a structure basically

541
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:59,000
last example I wanted to bring was this

542
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:03,040
one where everything has a thermal based

543
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,830
and decreasing trend is to find days

544
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,110
regarding new trains and projects people

545
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:12,530
are tending towards Ethernet more and

546
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:16,790
more so you can see the trend network

547
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:21,830
above the vehicle boss below the vc

548
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:24,620
users saw master with master the driver

549
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:27,260
interface of previous information system

550
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:31,310
society show passengers whatever is

551
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:41,060
necessary and then the input and output

552
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:45,230
nodes and this will be of control

553
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:48,050
systems couple making the train train

554
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:51,290
something big but we have a lot of

555
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:56,659
pressure from train builders to reduce

556
00:31:51,290 --> 00:32:00,139
sizes from here the trend is to wear

557
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:03,260
virtualized PLC's to reduce things as

558
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:07,270
much as possible so here we have a vc of

559
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,270
the middle different accession modes

560
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:13,049
and below we have of those purple

561
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:15,720
modules which are the input and output

562
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:24,720
with electronics and the cabling we

563
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:27,710
connect it to each of them and for many

564
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,750
years something has been done right away

565
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:37,590
which is safety for more than a century

566
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:39,240
in fact we need to develop a control

567
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,850
system to be implemented on the track

568
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,240
now the rules of how to land rely on a

569
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:49,110
safety a very strict rules of how to

570
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,799
test and certify that are strict - in

571
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:54,780
fact you need to develop to follow a

572
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:58,850
ii-v development model that's how you

573
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:00,960
should specify each system in the

574
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:03,928
component and package and then how you

575
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,570
should try them out there are different

576
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:12,120
safety levels if it's a high street wear

577
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:14,370
allows you to be certified as I go three

578
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,969
and four

579
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:20,399
normal proximity trains with sio one and

580
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:23,190
two is north and well being here is that

581
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,779
we really need a lot of effort here is

582
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:31,049
something quite a material however we

583
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:33,270
may easily find made a search unless you

584
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:39,000
want to inspect that means to find many

585
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:41,580
examples of accidents some cases the

586
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,990
driver was supplying other case gated

587
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:47,309
systems but it depends on the case it

588
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,190
could also be the implement the

589
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:54,750
petitions or the lack of investment I'm

590
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:58,080
not gonna mention details these kind of

591
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:01,799
things will only happen in Spain this

592
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,070
picture was in Sweden for 2013 a keen

593
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:07,950
lady is how he will be good idea to work

594
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:10,199
around to pay this rent for a walk she

595
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,790
didn't know how to market though but

596
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,129
it's quite surprising that it would be

597
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:16,310
so easy to take a train and go for a

598
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:16,310
walk

599
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,579
and a couple of years ago there were

600
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:26,909
some gouramis and surface project but

601
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:31,109
they seem like today station and maybe

602
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:33,839
our railway play control even with

603
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:36,179
webcams mic is more really sick and they

604
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,549
put everything on the internet and the

605
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:44,879
most wanted to take in the experiment

606
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:47,538
for me or two conclusions first even the

607
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,538
town's made

608
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:58,470
to the trainer's fullest peer he could

609
00:34:51,969 --> 00:35:01,029
actually derail he's not surprising

610
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:05,980
ethical things you wouldn't know just

611
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:08,470
over time is something and in fact what

612
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,720
more the attack has had a be not hard no

613
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,359
knowledge of a control system and

614
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,450
there's my argument when I talk to

615
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:18,810
colleagues to show that sometimes a lack

616
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,810
of knowledge

617
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:29,050
is not a limitation someone could learn

618
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,590
how to do things if you look for

619
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:34,930
examples were security has been an issue

620
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,750
for the world of railway there aren't

621
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,759
that many

622
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:43,150
it's a slowly do with a lot of

623
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,310
connectivity of trains traditionally

624
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:50,190
even though that is changing is going to

625
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:53,080
keep changing but it all three examples

626
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:55,330
one of them was this problem in 2003 in

627
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:59,069
the Washington signalling system due to

628
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:02,799
blast survivors is a really yummy way is

629
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:06,900
I was working but then I need you for

630
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,900
what if you machine is about that

631
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,750
and the message in the gates was

632
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:17,370
interesting in 2014 in 2008 or 14 year

633
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:22,120
old teenager manufacturer devised to

634
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:24,759
Chandlers to play with the truck weighs

635
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:28,000
in probably harder or fun until the one

636
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,750
or the truck weighs derailed and then

637
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,220
there were 12 people and when police got

638
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:37,270
there probably found yourself on

639
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,549
cybersecurity there was not one of the

640
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:41,590
main

641
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:44,020
focal points of manufacturer when they

642
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:49,720
design the system here in Ukraine in

643
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:52,420
2015 my world was also found in the

644
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:57,359
train operator with our big consequences

645
00:36:52,420 --> 00:37:01,890
however well the lots of internet owners

646
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:05,710
and the car handle is quite fashionable

647
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:10,240
right how can two Muslims come from the

648
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:13,500
UK so that's I think they're quite

649
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:18,669
vertical workers racing until you find

650
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:28,180
this this was thinking for about BBC

651
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:31,260
documentary largest UK and so on do the

652
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:33,629
screen shows of the video they zoomed

653
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:40,210
and there is a password

654
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:42,040
just to say something in favor of the

655
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,160
user that was possible 3 there should be

656
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,690
at least 3 times or even I'm secure than

657
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,279
password 1 and use a closing

658
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:52,390
presentation I just have a few slides

659
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:55,500
left I like to think about something

660
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,500
what do you think

661
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:02,609
Reese come to us the main threat

662
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:04,950
elements that we focus because we have

663
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:10,279
are targeted attacks and just blaster

664
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:13,259
for gonna cry years FFT German operator

665
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,059
and to clean up things from the security

666
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,549
perspective it shouldn't be a big

667
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:22,400
problem we have the Tigers cybercrime

668
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:25,740
they find the black metal operator

669
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,630
window he is not the easiest sector to

670
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,629
obtain money from deceptive dance

671
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,940
but to me the main focus in the

672
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:36,859
motivation to execute our cybersecurity

673
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:41,210
seriously the world of trends is

674
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:43,670
celery's is clear that the railway

675
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:46,279
environment is an objective is a target

676
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:50,720
of terrorism you have lots of people in

677
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:55,819
a small environment in small space so

678
00:38:50,720 --> 00:39:00,618
that is a target and soon for terrorists

679
00:38:55,819 --> 00:39:04,369
it will be easier cheaper and safer

680
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:06,920
because you cyber attack that to pull up

681
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:09,650
a bomb on the track not a living if we

682
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:13,190
keep the strength to interconnect drains

683
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:15,339
need to change the way things have been

684
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:20,829
done then we have nation-states

685
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:20,828
well you freedo car off hey

686
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,130
and password on the network protocols

687
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,840
who can't even really protect us from

688
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:32,270
those attacks but if you want to lay or

689
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,980
not another country to wrestle

690
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:39,890
communications will be a pure objective

691
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:44,140
because there are potential threat let's

692
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,140
see whether the clicker works

693
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:53,300
we are doing at an event or Senate were

694
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:55,600
trained network could really talk to if

695
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,740
we have an insert of interconnectivity

696
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,118
Wi-Fi mobile and so on

697
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,600
these will be one of their time to

698
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,710
packages compromising the adviser with

699
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:08,299
engineers will be used to update or

700
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:10,550
maintain the train systems this could be

701
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,460
more their time vectors and physically

702
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:16,160
in the train if we manage to connect to

703
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,840
network we're seeing how they network

704
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,000
broker phones work

705
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,090
of course he would be an easy way of

706
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,660
doing is been regarding physical

707
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:28,880
security their member controls to avoid

708
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:32,660
connecting from a truck to a transfer it

709
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,450
eventually another of the potential

710
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:38,339
sound vectors is from the comfort bus

711
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:43,140
the multimedia

712
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:44,609
especially if you're providing users the

713
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,410
possibility to have my Peter Pan I've

714
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,410
Wi-Fi or something similar

715
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:55,589
we challenges the refinement if you want

716
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:58,589
to look a cybersecurity in the world

717
00:40:55,589 --> 00:41:00,650
well away well they thinks he has

718
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:04,920
lifecycle disease systems there could be

719
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:07,769
20 30 or even 40 years if I send this or

720
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,469
trying even though they might be able to

721
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:17,939
update the software this will be there

722
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:20,489
for at least 20 years in processing if

723
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:25,680
we want to have a TPM over any hardware

724
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:29,809
security control will need to assist for

725
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,808
20 years and these are still a challenge

726
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:37,379
the processing capabilities what it is

727
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:39,538
you will keep keep being so in 30 years

728
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,239
so if you want future software

729
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:44,099
implementation this will be a limitation

730
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:46,229
and we have service a safety is very

731
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,689
much you you really need to go through

732
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:51,448
some controls get the power

733
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:53,549
certification and this process can be

734
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:55,090
lengthy take months and be very

735
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:59,310
expensive for

736
00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:02,620
the component developer the problem here

737
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:04,000
is a fire and fire were able durability

738
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,980
the component I want to get a

739
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,500
partnership once I have the punch ready

740
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:15,100
this cannot be 20 in the Train you know

741
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:17,080
system be safety certified first of all

742
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,970
he needs to go through the arches

743
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:22,299
authorization process it may take two or

744
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:25,750
three months because you cannot change a

745
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:28,300
simple cold line without notifying its

746
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:30,840
and he were looking other possible

747
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,840
solutions

748
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:37,599
may have regarded the scepter to make

749
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:40,119
these more agile you know if you really

750
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,140
need to assault a lot of Optima system

751
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:47,170
you may do so than agile effective way

752
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:51,310
and then actually sure even though now

753
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:54,730
everything's connected with cable and

754
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:57,990
will be do have wireless components

755
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:02,230
because scheduling trainers is costly

756
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:03,430
rotation and also maintenance we're not

757
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:06,310
there yet

758
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:07,990
but in a few years probably get to

759
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:11,950
Harvick's from russia by train

760
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:16,660
manufacturers for component that's to be

761
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:20,200
taken acted one is the with vehicle

762
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:23,770
support so serious challenge but by them

763
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:27,759
protocols should have hours to

764
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:32,170
securitize network just to finish with

765
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,890
on a positive note because of being

766
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:37,450
quite realistic or even piss misuk

767
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,190
before my part of the presentation I

768
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:41,460
like to say that even though it takes

769
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:44,920
time we can see that things are changing

770
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:47,520
regard in relation operate train

771
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:51,190
operators are being requested to really

772
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,369
take seriously the cybersecurity aspects

773
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:57,730
in amongst them if you were required to

774
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:58,960
the supply chain to the same thing so

775
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:02,970
train operators are they buy new

776
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,470
trainers should have in their conditions

777
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:08,319
certain reasonable requirements we are

778
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,910
in cybersecurity which means the train

779
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,340
builders

780
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:16,450
begin demanding from us as component

781
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:18,130
leaders and there are our systems have

782
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:21,990
certain capabilities along in

783
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:24,040
cybersecurity we also see that

784
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:26,290
conferences are being held another

785
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,800
sector begins is beginning talk about

786
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,810
cybersecurity

787
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,540
nothing happened a few years ago and

788
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:35,590
people are actually investing all the

789
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:38,110
Train builders do you have departments

790
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:42,970
in case of a big with hundreds of people

791
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:46,150
for big trend builder and these people

792
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:48,959
work on cybersecurity and this is a

793
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:52,390
positive message that gives us certain

794
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,600
hope for the future and this is it

795
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,920
really I don't know what I was it

796
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,440
interesting that you hope so

797
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,430
and if you have any questions or

798
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,840
comments please go ahead

799
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:03,819
otherwise you come and look at the

800
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,290
device there isn't that much to see but

801
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,490
if you're curious about it you're

802
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,290
welcome to come and see it thank you

803
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:15,479
very much

804
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:15,480
[Applause]

805
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,049
the questions that you want to come and

806
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:24,828
take a look

807
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:28,579
why do they it's very heavy and I've

808
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:32,329
been carrying it around all day we're

809
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:34,339
doing quite well for time there's the

810
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:37,689
break afterwards you want to approach

811
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:41,890
the speaker and ask her the questions

812
00:45:37,689 --> 00:45:41,890
face to face thanks very much
