1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:08,370
thanks for coming I thought being the

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,670
last time there'd be less people but it

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,709
is the first time I give a talk at the

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:21,150
moment at a film theater but it's a

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:23,510
great experience but it's great that you

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:30,330
coming here so early

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:32,759
my name is Shayla my surname is Bertha

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,550
so many people find it confusing

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,059
I come from Argentina and I believe it

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:44,760
is the first time you will hear when I

11
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:47,449
continue an accent does not come from

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,629
Spain that's quite striking but anyway I

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,870
hope I will represent the American

14
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:59,459
continent

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:01:05,009
probably bit more about me offensive

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:08,220
security I like breaking things and it's

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,630
because I find it it's fun that's not

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,658
that I have anything against you in

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:17,880
defence I developer for ASM

20
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,780
microcontroller microcontrollers and

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,820
microprocessors and I've put I've

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,560
written in depth on and the good thing

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,860
about DEFCON is that after speaking

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,689
after in front of 5,000 people I'm no

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,729
longer nervous anymore I also

26
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,789
participated in a court which is the

27
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:42,720
biggest one in Argentina and people come

28
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:46,229
from all over the place if you want to

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,920
come these years held in September but

30
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,140
let's move into the topic what is

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,930
persistence this job talk is about

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,880
persistence techniques when we talk

33
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,310
about persistence is that when you

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,530
compromise your system as an attacker

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,860
you're after two things one of them is

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,189
to get privileges as much as possible as

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,769
many as possible and to person

38
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:11,859
in the system that is to stay there for

39
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:18,730
as long as possible and that involves

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,730
surviving - the equipment rebooting etc

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:26,299
the truth is there's something that I

42
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,760
was very surprised about that's why this

43
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:30,440
talk and that is that the most common

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,149
persistence technique

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,579
it goes back back many years ago some of

46
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,629
you will get nostalgic about this you

47
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:45,440
might raise your hands if you will

48
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:48,560
recognize this theory to pictures but

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:53,000
please note that the way in which you in

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,090
which these Trojans persist is just by

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:06,019
doing a copy of the executable to a

52
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:09,970
system folder and with what happens

53
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:13,099
after the user authenticated himself

54
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:15,799
there's in spying it they tell you the

55
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:19,700
route which is at the top and this is a

56
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:22,700
very simple technique but it's spread us

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,168
until today and even Mehta Floyd the

58
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,548
famous metaphor take persistence command

59
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:31,790
exactly the same thing it competed in

60
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:39,109
the portrait in a random file and it had

61
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:45,168
a route exactly in the same key there

62
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:47,840
were some alternatives but some people

63
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:50,299
some people work harder and we're

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,239
looking for some other options where

65
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:56,269
they also they also can add up to

66
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,180
programs that launch when window opens

67
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:03,650
up and we have two of them in this

68
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,450
screen here you can add programs that

69
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,680
open that initiate themselves with

70
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:12,738
Windows the thing is that using these

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,930
are four percent persistence has some

72
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:22,330
disadvantages a big one

73
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:28,810
is that it's the antivirus do not like

74
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:31,930
us to to write anything there and on the

75
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,960
other hand is very simple to find by a

76
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,639
user with with even very little

77
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,830
knowledge there are many tools within

78
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,380
Windows that allows you to see which

79
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:44,250
other systems that initiate with the

80
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,330
system and you can find them and you can

81
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,580
delete them and that's where their

82
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:54,070
persistence fails the big question is it

83
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,490
is the best way to persist in the system

84
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,349
even if it is widely used and has been

85
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,260
widely used for such a long time and the

86
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,690
answer of course is no and that's why

87
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,719
that's why I call it the art of

88
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:10,419
persistence throughout this talk we will

89
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,110
see three different techniques to pursue

90
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:20,919
but the truth is that none of the three

91
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:22,900
have I found myself but you say that a

92
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,400
malware could persist by using this

93
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,280
technique of this other technique that

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,780
what you call from theory you want to go

95
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,090
from theory to practice there are no

96
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,219
longer documentation about it and that

97
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,679
the problem I found this technique that

98
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,050
we use that were mentioned as an

99
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:45,130
alternative I wanted to see if they were

100
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:46,870
actually effective in practice the

101
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,320
techniques that we are going to see I

102
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:54,430
very much connected with the comm

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:58,479
objects so what do we need to know about

104
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,639
them a-come object is the simplest class

105
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,820
class that has a model structure defined

106
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,639
by microscope and it had methods and

107
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:09,729
functions that other programs can invoke

108
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,650
it can do it in two different ways they

109
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:16,599
are dll and the customary program can

110
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:21,599
invoke them out of process or in process

111
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:25,930
we go to the in process example and

112
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:33,099
granted it's the GOM object looks for

113
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:36,069
the DL and it loads it and if we we can

114
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:42,370
use this if you were to see which come

115
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:46,539
objects are in our system we're going to

116
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:49,660
zoom in a bit to see that they come

117
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:55,780
object can't be I are identified by a

118
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:59,199
CLS ID which is a GU ID that identifies

119
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,940
the object in a clear color but it's

120
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,039
always going to be the same identifier

121
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,889
it's not that it changed in every

122
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,699
installation of Windows and it is always

123
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:12,190
the same and it's inherited a different

124
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:17,159
window versions we have the same a

125
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:24,300
terrific idea everyone - we can use this

126
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:27,789
tool or we go to and and we can use a

127
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:34,210
good ID generator and I say that because

128
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:36,280
we will do it these objects as I just

129
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,289
said are going you have to look for them

130
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,859
somewhere and where are they they are in

131
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:43,860
the registry there are two classes

132
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:53,830
here's one example where we can see a

133
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:55,990
locker machine it can be any of the two

134
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,060
routes and here's the object and if you

135
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,460
look at the data it tells you roughly

136
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,990
what Beneful formation about that object

137
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,989
some have more than others

138
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,949
what's more interesting for us is the

139
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,349
sake of the probes in pro server it

140
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,360
tells you where the the end of that

141
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:15,719
object is which is what's going to load

142
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,580
the program that you are invoking it

143
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:22,300
could be in rock server 32 in prop

144
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,520
server in pro hunter 32 whether you are

145
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,639
in pro hunter these are the keys of

146
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,840
interest for us there are other

147
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,120
keyserling to come objects

148
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,059
[Music]

149
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,299
but the one that we are interested in

150
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,829
from viewpoint as our attackers are this

151
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,289
ones which other ones that tell you

152
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:45,910
which is the DLL and where is the one

153
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:50,199
did you have to load so after this brief

154
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:53,439
introduction to the first technique

155
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,279
which is through cell extensions and

156
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,370
both hadees microsoft offers users the

157
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,100
possibility of iterative applications

158
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:09,850
with a great day to integrate them with

159
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:11,800
a graphic interface and perhaps this one

160
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,490
is the one we use more often with the

161
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:19,630
one allows that allows developers to add

162
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:23,980
main program functions to the graphic

163
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:27,490
shell so when you do right click on the

164
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:30,660
right you can see the functions of the

165
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:33,700
programs of the developer the most

166
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,910
common example is the wind run that

167
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,670
allows you to compress files so this

168
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,430
menu is the more common one but as an

169
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,040
attacker one that I like a lot is econ

170
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:50,739
over 100 and I will tell you why and

171
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:54,790
it's wrong if we want to register our

172
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,339
own extension it is this simple this is

173
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,410
an example of real extensions all

174
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,750
extents which are always in the registry

175
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,079
and here you can see their route and

176
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,080
they are available for all system users

177
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,540
etc

178
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,510
here we have the example of their local

179
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:17,670
machine this is the route software

180
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:20,460
classes thanks and in inside we will

181
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:24,810
find the type of exception here we have

182
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:30,500
the one that is registered another

183
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:36,239
example those under computer key

184
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:39,290
register and for this user it's the one

185
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,670
that's going to see the sell extension

186
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,520
and what's interesting about the

187
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:49,079
extensions that are registered here is

188
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:56,699
that you need no administrator privilege

189
00:10:49,080 --> 00:11:02,910
so an application could the user to a

190
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:05,010
grant to aggregate an extension if we

191
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,260
did the process manually they're going

192
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,390
to see the first one we have to take two

193
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,510
steps first of all we have to generate

194
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:17,580
an extension with whatever name under

195
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:19,980
this route to have it do it are a GUI ID

196
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:24,270
and then generate this identifier with a

197
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:27,660
common object of so we have to

198
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,810
regenerate then where they have been

199
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:34,410
identified then with that we associated

200
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:39,449
to a common object and then we listed

201
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:47,910
where all the color objects are so we

202
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:51,180
feel the same UID with this key to

203
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:54,750
indicate which is the deity the ll that

204
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,410
has to be uploaded when indicated we're

205
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,410
going to do

206
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:03,199
here we can use for instance this as

207
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:06,980
speed that allows us to generate one

208
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:14,600
entry informant that we can use this one

209
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:16,990
and get a DLL format beyond the malware

210
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,230
itself will have to create a malicious

211
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:24,770
script that does what we've just done

212
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:28,970
manually so the script is required

213
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:31,880
simple it generates the first registry

214
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:35,570
key Y which identifies the extension

215
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:38,630
today we introduce the GUI D in it we

216
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:44,510
can easily generate and that jus IP will

217
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:47,840
also be food into the common objects

218
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:53,540
around and finally we download the DLN

219
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:56,720
and and we loaded in a file this script

220
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,329
is not detected by the typical antivirus

221
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,780
Azure applications because it doesn't do

222
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,780
anything

223
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:09,350
download tip the material it doesn't

224
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:14,150
execute therefore I have not found any

225
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:19,310
problem with that so let's look at the

226
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:23,660
demo if we run this malicious script we

227
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:26,270
generate the keys that we need this is a

228
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:32,329
virtual machine of the attacker so if

229
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:37,250
you click on the right side the shell is

230
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:43,070
removed why because we have generated a

231
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:46,610
generic malicious extension so that will

232
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:49,810
be executed when the user does the right

233
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,759
hand and click anywhere

234
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,729
so I mentioned that there are other

235
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,040
another type that I like what is icon on

236
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,850
our handle which is very good because it

237
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,149
does request in that right hand side

238
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:08,499
click from the user as you open in a

239
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:12,009
window of Explorer it's uploaded because

240
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:16,350
it is associated to the icons of the

241
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:20,339
file so when the icons are uploaded the

242
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:25,529
malicious extension is executed the only

243
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:35,829
comment of this extension is that a unit

244
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:39,430
administrator privilege has that those

245
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:41,469
privileges you can use the technique of

246
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:46,300
the previous example and they persist in

247
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:50,220
a much more unnoticeable way for this

248
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:54,849
first technique which is the simplest

249
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,939
the cell extensions can be used to

250
00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:01,720
generate persistent we do not need

251
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:04,449
administrator privileges and it's it's

252
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:08,430
stealthy method or stealth here that

253
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:14,639
we've seen earlier on and first and

254
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:18,008
harder and has a tab where it shows the

255
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,180
shell extensions that are in the system

256
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:25,029
so it's harder to detect but we could

257
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:28,149
find that there is a select cell X

258
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:32,670
function that shouldn't be running so

259
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,670
the recommendation is to use PowerShell

260
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:39,790
because he'd say we provide starts to

261
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,420
Windows and it allows us about the

262
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,420
registry

263
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,480
what they do not mention in the

264
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,089
documentation when they talk about this

265
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,000
they nobody tells you that if you don't

266
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,550
want to create this type of kids in the

267
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,650
registry you're going to need

268
00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:03,069
trustworthy binary that even PowerShell

269
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:07,959
is one so I recommend to do it with

270
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:12,400
PowerShell okay we're going to move on

271
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,660
to bit more interesting techniques with

272
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,150
hi jack

273
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,550
there's a lot of talk and we were seeing

274
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:22,150
that with a come objects what they are

275
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:25,060
and how we register them so this is here

276
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:30,520
but when an application is looking for

277
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:32,140
an object it can do it with local teen

278
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,840
is where all objects are usually

279
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:39,220
personal what happens with the hi jack

280
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:43,690
is that the TM is registered under this

281
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:45,430
key and if it code and look for it it's

282
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,530
going to find it because it's where it

283
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:50,349
really is but the problem is when the

284
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:55,870
application does a first search and

285
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:58,690
they're exactly the same proud but on on

286
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:05,230
this user so you're going to look for

287
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:07,930
the two UID there and it's not there so

288
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:11,980
if it's not there you have to consider

289
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:14,580
the possibility of creating it and I'm

290
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:20,459
having it back to the TV via so it's

291
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:23,500
that's what we do okay so we don't need

292
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,810
mr. privileges to do this just like in

293
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,359
the former case we can create and he

294
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:31,779
called we won mm permission

295
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:34,539
so need to find about a rule I thought

296
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:38,710
this be difficult but it is not 90% of

297
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:39,340
the arms provided our noble to come hi

298
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,559
John

299
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,059
so it's very easy to find out about the

300
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:45,970
applications remaining you use the

301
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:49,629
famous drop monitors is internal these

302
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,570
filters in particular we try to get the

303
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,269
part so how these goals are actually for

304
00:17:52,570 --> 00:18:01,899
us interesting for us and the result

305
00:17:55,269 --> 00:18:04,929
should be named not found wrong crow

306
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,929
[Music]

307
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:13,269
small screen sharp this crown was along

308
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:17,019
with many come objects look for the were

309
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:20,799
not found with a registry park where we

310
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:26,260
can write without problem so we need to

311
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:30,100
take one of these movies come objects so

312
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:32,139
we actually take the UID and now a

313
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,939
script is a bit shorter book because we

314
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:36,299
just need to create an entry which is

315
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,299
this one here

316
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:46,899
there's a bit of a joke but we tried to

317
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:51,450
load a URL here and that is a soul song

318
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:51,449
well so let's see what happens here

319
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,040
okay so we run the script first machine

320
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,020
is always waiting and then we

321
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,940
double-click on Google Chrome and now we

322
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:09,310
can see how this is executed it is quite

323
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,100
simple and there are some things that

324
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:15,850
are found along the way many come

325
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,179
hijacks are actually shared amongst

326
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:21,219
applications these come that we use here

327
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:26,440
will also be looked for by fun Firefox

328
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:28,510
so you do not need to have many

329
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:39,220
different and compound lives to infect a

330
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:42,220
machine dependent application that might

331
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:47,190
not be solved so we keep going in the

332
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:50,410
investigation we see many objects that

333
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,550
are proprietary of Windows loaded with

334
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,850
the operating system that are also

335
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:57,970
vulnerable how is French isn't it with

336
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,959
Windows it's quite easy to find out

337
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,809
because

338
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,830
the root classes in the registry we find

339
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:19,490
there hundreds of objects listed here we

340
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:20,990
go ahead in Gator this is great we can

341
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:28,690
see what this is about so it's much

342
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:28,690
easier to find this what's problem here

343
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:35,479
Windows is long it goes to root classes

344
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:37,669
for these register button and even being

345
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,350
administrators we cannot write directly

346
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,429
there if you don't have permissions or

347
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:46,158
being any strangers

348
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:48,679
however the root classes reflect a mix

349
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,960
between local machine and so for classes

350
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,169
then curtain is a source of flow classes

351
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,490
so we do not have the permission to

352
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,679
write in local machine room that's where

353
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,090
these writers or directly in root

354
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:08,059
classes as I said however we can write

355
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:10,840
kernel users without having do you so

356
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,840
right what we can

357
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:51,350
the windows so we could do Han Jahn

358
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:55,360
Kanani yes so we can try a virtual

359
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,360
machine or some of them break anything

360
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,660
the majority of them think there are

361
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:05,840
blood level actually so here in the

362
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,390
script we replace the object and all the

363
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,189
rest is exactly the same we download

364
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:15,020
malware and we create a route we need

365
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,790
and we have two virtual machines and the

366
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,620
attacker already have a search you want

367
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:22,070
to use machine yeah

368
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,959
but when they listen to discuss loss if

369
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,860
we don't mean left any time what type of

370
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,690
resistance this will be around so let's

371
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,330
apply the persistence using the comm

372
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,759
object or we just saw from Windows

373
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:39,259
uploaded on the system against

374
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:41,719
run once again handler I'm listening to

375
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:45,649
get the connection um there's something

376
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:47,389
quite interesting here which is at the

377
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:53,059
window subjects are floppy fairly

378
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:55,218
quickly once they you surprise the

379
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:58,369
password because well we'll get these

380
00:22:55,219 --> 00:23:00,229
objects before the desktop appears on

381
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:09,139
the attacking machine we get the

382
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:15,949
connection so uploading enemies it's

383
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:18,228
interesting even the antivirus

384
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:20,899
connection and the antivirus Hanson

385
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:23,389
haven't even started so for me this is a

386
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:26,839
very persistent technique are in find

387
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:30,109
any disadvantage so far the great

388
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,519
advantage here the begin so quick that

389
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,349
many of the production solutions that

390
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,319
we've implemented will not be being

391
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:38,229
behaving initiative of disciplines the

392
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,849
other half is very difficult to detect

393
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:43,339
their applications such as Ottomans

394
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:44,029
I dunno share these kind of things it is

395
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,698
very difficult

396
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:50,379
do you see that our Delta Islamic

397
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:54,799
Windows the provider object are

398
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:56,770
difficult act we do tests and we find to

399
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,360
run objects

400
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,879
difficult because our many most of them

401
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:05,139
work well and there we have a very good

402
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,690
persistence at least much better on the

403
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,840
wrong keys that have been there for like

404
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,270
20 years

405
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,500
fine was remarkable little but with

406
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:19,389
these kind of things is implemented

407
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,340
someone way really this research I

408
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,100
checked what I was selling malware I

409
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,189
used some different persistence and only

410
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,389
found almost one in the use come hijack

411
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:33,610
but not the sort of commercial rather a

412
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,890
commonality there is some well-known

413
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:39,310
applications but you saw that you get an

414
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,240
idea on how will these persistence is

415
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,760
here

416
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,320
you may wonder why because there was not

417
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,050
much documentation on the practical

418
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:56,080
implementation along the way we need to

419
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:57,970
think about this of times sum up the and

420
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,040
if you've come up he's unable to compile

421
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,140
Jacobi use of more assistance a tiger

422
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,810
does not need any privileges as I said

423
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:07,570
these uses with dishonor and these works

424
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:10,030
on Sal Vulcano Zoo and he's a super self

425
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:15,700
and others but if he is telling tonight

426
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:21,639
Plus remember 22 years PowerShell

427
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:23,920
two pipe as restrictions registry

428
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,980
password where two rights should be used

429
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,960
with Pasha shelf regarding Windows also

430
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:33,700
as a while processes by extension

431
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,190
country so which other sanction what are

432
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,190
the such powers well in the root class

433
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:44,620
registries who's in the fridge extension

434
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:54,730
type in our very old so here we have

435
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:57,429
dark pitiful before this in charge of

436
00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:03,580
opening files with a kind of sensual and

437
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:06,760
VLC opens a kind of a beautify them so

438
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,250
we look for this within the actual world

439
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,520
class code you're gonna see the open

440
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:17,770
command what it executes is basically

441
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:21,430
you execute the VLC and it transfers the

442
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:24,190
file to another can we hug up this well

443
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:29,560
everything is enroute classes so we will

444
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:32,940
have answers however we could look for

445
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,940
the same thing for these round

446
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:41,000
users and Clancy's and creator the VLC

447
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,730
like great their whole combination

448
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,070
correspond to the program that will not

449
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,980
be there you need to create like windows

450
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:54,919
with aggressive synchronous anything and

451
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:56,270
we will start on and he would not talk

452
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,820
about would come off the experience

453
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:05,930
except fines so we just execute there's

454
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:08,689
something else that we should take into

455
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:11,540
Consulate's door test as you can see

456
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,150
here the script is basically saying that

457
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:18,320
the only thing we do is to change their

458
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:22,510
curve we need to be eight and users 2000

459
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:25,730
areas power shutters otherwise directly

460
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:28,850
you can try to the user code you just

461
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:31,310
have that blinding and the same thing

462
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,159
Grady necessary code at the upper

463
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:37,750
command

464
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:40,120
and the x-files is from somewhere we're

465
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:44,680
gonna do a first test so you can see a

466
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:47,729
detail of need to correct expected so

467
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm going to use this the time to later

468
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:55,510
to see it practically and to see the

469
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:59,460
problem so we have an mp4 file some

470
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:02,620
video and here when I click on that

471
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:06,040
degree of lesson you play but we hope is

472
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,830
about like so the user will not see

473
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,300
everything you'll be clicking on that

474
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:13,740
play the video eventually clear the form

475
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:17,250
of the machine that is not good for us

476
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:22,080
so to solve that

477
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:24,960
we can create some sort of proxy that

478
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,049
executes malware as well as a minute

479
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,610
program so that the user doesn't have

480
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:36,750
reasonable suspicion

481
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:40,379
so this proxy a little : and I compile

482
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:45,450
the x-files and go sponsor will Dow and

483
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:48,240
these code first executives interpreter

484
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,429
wherever it is and then the real

485
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,350
application of our parameters the both

486
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:56,000
with registry as you can see a plan

487
00:28:53,350 --> 00:29:02,719
the only thing that you need to add here

488
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:05,950
is to download not meet our tutor from

489
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,980
somewhere but does the easiest bit

490
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:12,820
someone's we have that proxy people have

491
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,820
secured today

492
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,750
before file numbers of we get a

493
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,330
connection and the video is also played

494
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,809
so these for the user these will be

495
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,809
quite transparent

496
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:30,240
[Music]

497
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:35,060
and think this is a very interesting to

498
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,260
age different from what we saw earlier

499
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:42,929
metal form well these are good

500
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:45,060
alternatives a good alternative to even

501
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:49,130
do these with fine text so maybe people

502
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:53,070
can go to extensions he depends on URI

503
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:55,560
so to sum up the essential avenues may

504
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,389
also be de minimis for positions in

505
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,270
doctor does not either it's a privilege

506
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:03,240
to do what we do we do reduce alien to

507
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:06,570
her junk an extension - we don't need

508
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,780
any permission to her it works with

509
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,050
Sandra towns and his parts are told

510
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:18,210
maybe not as subtle as a form of Amazon

511
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:20,580
but is better the other alternative is

512
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,280
if ruined they'll be more difficult to

513
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:26,759
attempt in this case PowerShell is not

514
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,969
necessary so it's even

515
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:34,440
panels are creating a AXA file or

516
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:37,049
malicious script the database so to

517
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,699
someone as a completion I think that

518
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,129
implementation of these techniques was

519
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:43,979
quite simple those famous Windows

520
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:49,589
features may be used for many things but

521
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:51,029
also to persist with malware to make

522
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:53,639
more sophisticated persistence

523
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:56,650
techniques cell theorem what if you

524
00:30:53,639 --> 00:31:06,859
adapt and that was it for me thank you

525
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:06,859
[Applause]

526
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,799
ma'am if you have any questions please

527
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:13,408
go ahead yes we do how time for

528
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,089
questions so you have doesn't do so

529
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:19,339
hello yes I my facts the faster speaker

530
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:22,289
actually come on don't be shy

531
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:22,739
she's come from very far away to be here

532
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:26,459
with us

533
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:29,789
well I'll be here for a while so it's

534
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:32,479
okay no probs we can always have a

535
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:32,479
childlike town

536
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:39,930
I shall laughing too much for your

537
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:41,190
speech has been very interesting from

538
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,680
the other side when I heard you're a

539
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:46,110
little bit but please give us a clue how

540
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:50,010
can we touch these things I don't know

541
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:53,449
about that that's your job to you so

542
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:56,360
said I tried to explain detection

543
00:31:53,450 --> 00:32:00,360
because those something that I thought

544
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,520
the most comprehensive tool exists to

545
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,820
attempt what he has become with Windows

546
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,200
his utterance from this internal is

547
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,879
quite well

548
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:15,470
he chose Alex and all the dealer dealer

549
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,900
supply of love with their the problem is

550
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:20,430
many things say yeah and detracting not

551
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,060
looking at this is for difficult which

552
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,060
is looking

553
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,260
[Music]

554
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:40,000
and detecting malicious things here but

555
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:42,430
I would be suspicious if I saw that

556
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,360
computer how so we behavior will open a

557
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:47,830
file let me know if there's something if

558
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,139
I don't know a way to do this ain't no

559
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:53,409
way that is the if it's not in the wrong

560
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,670
keys some people got that roughly to

561
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,850
register they see that there's nothing

562
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,990
weird and say or something different at

563
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,149
least now you know there are other

564
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,550
persistent techniques there are more

565
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,880
difficult to attempt and that was it

566
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,470
really

567
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,740
well thank you very much for your

568
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:11,340
question I know whether there are more

569
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,340
questions

570
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:18,710
hi well thank you much for your

571
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:24,330
presentation I do have a question

572
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:26,010
once you execute and once you change the

573
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,110
register clock register code is

574
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:30,990
difficult to detect but if you monitor

575
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:33,659
do it do it for PowerShell and if you

576
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:38,250
have a behavior or you see a code that

577
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:40,800
is writing the race drink Alex could you

578
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:45,120
block or get active if it happens yes

579
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:47,850
you will need to monitor nearly all

580
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,840
activities introduced but you could do

581
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:54,899
some sort of filter and maybe look for

582
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,510
those specific parts object to be right

583
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,690
I don't know whether this is the best

584
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:04,679
way to be but if you monitor the browser

585
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:07,020
says that you know that all the tell me

586
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,240
goes for those codes that can be

587
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,080
difficult but you could try to something

588
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,080
there okay thank you

589
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,279
other than your other questions hold on

590
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:27,759
I'm actually gonna go give you a

591
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:29,650
microphone so that you can make some

592
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,620
time but then you worry we do have time

593
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,060
for questions

594
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,049
hello show nothing thank you for your

595
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,290
presentation

596
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:42,659
just like the golly I'm a novice and

597
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:42,659
kind of bugged with this but it's okay

598
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:50,080
so would you some little hating-ass

599
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:53,669
positions in the system because when I

600
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,960
turn it off or go away I have my server

601
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:59,770
which is listening to different

602
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,390
computers or infected teams from the SRT

603
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:06,550
they get connected and there's a free

604
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:10,240
bar so the infected teams you can

605
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:12,940
actually generate Windows distros with

606
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,339
infected elt that you could distribute

607
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,890
could I be done could I actually package

608
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:22,660
your clone as a virtual machine

609
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:26,230
distribute days and keep living yes in

610
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:28,560
fact so you've been bought for a while

611
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,560
apparently

612
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:38,210
so sorry for breaking the ambience but

613
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,960
there are many we know his copies so

614
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:47,540
we're kind of free the hard mal were

615
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:49,280
everywhere hello hi Charla another

616
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,880
question and calculations for your

617
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,880
presentation

618
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,650
I've also been working with PowerShell

619
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:00,199
another few things but have you had any

620
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:04,279
problem with the execution of American

621
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:07,279
missions to run the PowerShell to

622
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:08,920
execute on their abilities ex-gays no

623
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:13,579
not really

624
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,829
as I said at some point he doesn't do

625
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:25,099
anything that may reveal marquales

626
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:27,319
militias in this case for those codes is

627
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:31,489
not suspicious in the register be

628
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:35,029
released from you is outrageous behavior

629
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:39,019
and you get all over the meat

630
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:43,249
interpreter put a lien against the MC on

631
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:46,308
the slope of a defender none of them

632
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:48,078
popped up no antivirus porn stuff

633
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:52,430
another question you changed the attack

634
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,049
sin of PowerShell to dom exe which is

635
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,469
also possible to render things more

636
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:57,969
difficult

637
00:36:54,469 --> 00:37:00,969
no not really a draw my life videos much

638
00:36:57,969 --> 00:37:00,969
so

639
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:14,930
because how you can have a bell DLNR

640
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:17,830
care connections to keep insecurity and

641
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:20,118
so what I sure can be greatly improved

642
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:23,020
believe you like it please go ahead

643
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,020
well thank you congratulations

644
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,880
are there any other questions

645
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:42,099
do you have to go back up how long let

646
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:50,829
you be the question because that

647
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:52,509
question doesn't serve a microphone so

648
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:56,349
did you give your account number to

649
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:58,539
Microsoft does Microsoft now oh this is

650
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:00,910
a or is this a well-known vulnerability

651
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:10,930
than the other might fix it do they know

652
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:13,299
what you hear abilities a feature but

653
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,788
maybe they could do something else they

654
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:18,130
cannot do much but maybe they could say

655
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:25,059
well if these happens please take into

656
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:27,460
account work could be done well I didn't

657
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:29,170
report Iraq reported directly but I have

658
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:35,319
seen people who did report similar

659
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:38,140
things but some come high Young's were

660
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:41,249
than jurors because they were in native

661
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,249
Windows applications

662
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:48,920
and they always say with a feature they

663
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,940
don't fix it that's probably how Windows

664
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:54,860
works because I didn't discover these

665
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,420
three techniques are nothing new that

666
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,030
might not be very implemented because

667
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:02,780
maybe people need to work a bit more on

668
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:07,190
them I but Microsoft knows for many

669
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:10,460
years is secondly yes other maybe you

670
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:12,140
can hijack the control sessions and

671
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,360
other malicious extensions there is

672
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:18,890
nothing new for Microsoft they never did

673
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:26,060
anything maybe that was not in former

674
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:28,279
Windows versions if you want to edit in

675
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:31,480
these specific curves you might not

676
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:35,090
allow you to do it without dog track

677
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,070
so there you could allottee is it very

678
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:39,740
very easy and now you want to have a

679
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,420
control we're only a vinyl and crossed

680
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,930
by american-led registry in these

681
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:47,120
specific classes if have a rack and our

682
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,680
track you can put things in any part of

683
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,540
the race rooms and except for these

684
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:57,520
cards with specific codes and they said

685
00:39:50,540 --> 00:40:01,640
well said well rather we do things here

686
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,620
the powershell and windows you need

687
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,930
permission to execute either Santorum's

688
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,460
also have it if you have full permission

689
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,980
to write there so we're using you to

690
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:13,360
work a little bit tonight but I don't

691
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,360
think that will change to be honest

692
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:25,809
maybe you should use PowerShell you just

693
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:25,808
cover a little dumpster

694
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,410
[Music]

695
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:33,789
maybe we shouldn't just leave powershot

696
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:37,129
alone because like a swiss knife or hide

697
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:38,660
my number two to end with it but he

698
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,289
might not be the expected solution

699
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,848
anymore

700
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:42,849
but thank you for your question

701
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:58,370
hi Sheila hi just a comment so that we

702
00:40:56,249 --> 00:41:00,980
don't forget

703
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:06,200
so the beauty who's occurred there is a

704
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:07,610
concept of permission in the register in

705
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,299
the rules especially with the right

706
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:13,190
planning those you can create rules of

707
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,000
these in the comm hijackings of a more

708
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:18,170
difficult in the case for sale excel

709
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:25,790
this might not be modified you change

710
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:27,710
the permission and the register balance

711
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:30,140
you might not be modified by adding or

712
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,940
modifying the value regarding Tom

713
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,410
hijacking it could be much more

714
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,480
difficult about sizing things with

715
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,069
registry because there's thousands of

716
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,920
things you could break something while

717
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:41,480
it's on something I need to rewrite but

718
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,450
that's a simple countermeasure he's

719
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,310
never taken to a pound but my it might

720
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,950
be interesting for the NTFS or

721
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,940
permission concept with its branches

722
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:52,759
because it's virtually but you might

723
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,950
want to use our home I just saw a bit of

724
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,400
fear there but well not everything is

725
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,180
lost

726
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,180
thank you

727
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,380
thank

728
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:14,540
much for your presentation was very

729
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:16,280
interesting and by default Windows you

730
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,290
shouldn't have permissions to all the

731
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,700
drug history but with PowerShell you can

732
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,880
alternate and on your part

733
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,980
are you limit to intersect PowerShell or

734
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,350
you can also have a things come to the

735
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:30,110
system and as long as you have

736
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:33,830
applications working with illustrator

737
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:36,320
permissions you said I think that really

738
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:38,750
gaps can be covered but well in the

739
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:44,270
account management you need permissions

740
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:50,920
to run PowerShell yes that's what I was

741
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:54,050
saying I'd by default you could do

742
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:58,760
Harding to try to block things however

743
00:42:54,050 --> 00:43:00,440
those cases usually flash shows there's

744
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,690
some other applications will they need

745
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,670
access and things are difficult so that

746
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,640
may be a bit difficult orizari

747
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:09,230
permissions the only option is with

748
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,650
pouch on the right table yes

749
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:20,060
Oh to find another one there is a way

750
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:24,500
out so I need Rossi binary something I

751
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:27,788
found quickly more and find another

752
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,859
possible way of doing things

753
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:31,989
my something that might fix things on

754
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:36,029
the spot but I don't think is a good way

755
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:36,029
of fixing things up thank you thank you

756
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:43,410
well if there are no further questions

757
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:46,260
thank you very much Shayla

758
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:46,259
[Applause]
