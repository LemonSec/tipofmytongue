00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,670
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to give a big thank you to</font>

3
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:35,829
ball because he he demonstrated very

4
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,140
very very very very very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

5
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:42,610
interesting collaborating with us okay

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:45,309
and the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is Paul</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vixy and a</font>

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,190
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things around enas was defined by</font>

8
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:50,230
him one of the first exploit I ever

9
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,839
tested in my life was big secret that

10
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,059
exploit the tool that Paul developed so

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,190
you have one of the biggest persons in

12
00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:06,759
internet so here you have all their

13
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:11,170
yours thank you good afternoon very kind

14
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:13,119
introduction it takes very<font color="#CCCCCC"> little effort</font>

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,549
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get me to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Hong Kong so thank</font>

16
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,179
you for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

17
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:21,639
security today first I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clean up</font>

18
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:26,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">a few misunderstandings I did not invent</font>

19
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:30,399
DNS palmata<font color="#CCCCCC"> petrus invented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS his good</font>

20
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:33,669
friend I took<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a lot of DNS after he</font>

21
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:35,319
left academia to go and do commercial

22
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:38,169
things so i spent about 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

23
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:41,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">on it so a lot of the bugs in early</font>

24
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:43,509
versions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bind were my fault</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i started</font>

25
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:46,989
a company internet systems consortium

26
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:51,369
that was started for the purpose of

27
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:53,770
owning the copyright to bind and it's

28
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:57,759
still there i am<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm now divorced try it</font>

29
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:03,158
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but any case i had a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with</font>

30
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:06,369
dns but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't invent it what else</font>

31
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,799
yes if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system d yet</font>

32
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:12,129
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have cron on your laptop</font>

33
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:13,660
it's probably mine and it hasn't had a

34
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:17,019
serious security

35
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,570
vulnerability reported in it for 15

36
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,810
years so I feel pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good about that</font>

37
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:28,959
and really who knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effect of</font>

38
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you ID okay so security is related very</font>

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,510
much to reliability you'd say that

40
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:38,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">something was secure if it was doing</font>

41
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,209
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but more specifically it</font>

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,990
say it was secure if it wasn't doing

43
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you didn't want but because you</font>

44
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,040
don't always<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you don't want we</font>

45
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,929
actually say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's secure if it's</font>

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,859
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing anything you wouldn't want if</font>

47
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:57,190
you knew what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was you may see some</font>

48
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,720
elasticity in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> definition of security</font>

49
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,340
by those three successive definitions

50
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,030
this is important and will become more

51
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,220
so as I speak because a lot of what

52
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,800
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in the security industry and</font>

53
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,750
I am a CEO of a security company so I am

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,020
partly to blame for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot of what</font>

55
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,360
we do in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security industry today is</font>

56
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,840
to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we don't</font>

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,020
understand this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work I'm</font>

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,420
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you why it won't work Rico</font>

59
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,340
has already given most of my best

60
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,790
material in his talk I've known he was

61
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,709
gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I meant not to come</font>

62
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,540
although he's an optimist he's telling

63
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,470
you that something can be done and I'm

64
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:44,940
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else so perhaps he</font>

65
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:49,450
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have a panel later in the week</font>

66
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:52,890
this is a real product for sale right

67
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:57,459
now on the internet you can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon</font>

68
00:03:52,890 --> 00:04:00,670
and what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do if you plug this in</font>

69
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:03,310
you put this between a power<font color="#E5E5E5"> outlet</font>

70
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:06,160
these are us-style power outlets but I'm

71
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,230
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a European version you</font>

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,480
put this between a<font color="#E5E5E5"> power outlet and your</font>

73
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,700
home gateway so you have some small

74
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,519
plastic box that came to you with your

75
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,430
dsl connection or maybe you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it</font>

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,739
as a Wi-Fi<font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway it probably came from</font>

77
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,600
a company like d-link or linksys or

78
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:25,630
maybe it has no<font color="#CCCCCC"> name at all it just came</font>

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,240
to you from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your phone company</font>

80
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:31,570
and the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> this solves is that your</font>

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,320
home gateway hangs just<font color="#CCCCCC"> at random</font>

82
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,630
intervals<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will stop working and this</font>

83
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:42,130
is a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix that by turning it off</font>

84
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:46,540
for a few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day and this is</font>

85
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:48,640
absurd this is nuts not just that this

86
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,940
device costs more than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gateway it's</font>

87
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,039
protecting not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that this is another</font>

88
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,560
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is itself likely to have</font>

89
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,570
bugs or itself hang I mean how many of

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,950
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to put in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> serial in</font>

91
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,030
order to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are all</font>

92
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:06,700
reliable but that we are so despondent

93
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,909
over the quality of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that home gateway</font>

94
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we are willing to fix it with this</font>

95
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,530
rather than go buy a better one we know

96
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:20,290
there isn't a better one we know there's

97
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:22,450
never going to be a better one so this

98
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,840
did make something more reliable I don't

99
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:31,030
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it made it more secure so I</font>

100
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:33,219
have a number of cutouts from just

101
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,830
screenshots that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken in the last</font>

102
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,930
year or so when I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

103
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,930
particular train of thought because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

104
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,900
wanted real world examples of technology

105
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:50,740
like that reset device in order to

106
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:53,739
illustrate a point and it's what you're

107
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,140
seeing here is simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> apple worrying</font>

108
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,860
about its supply chain and they should

109
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:03,070
they actually kicked supermicro out of

110
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Siri data center because there was a</font>

111
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,409
malicious piece of firmware available

112
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,840
for download for updating the firmware

113
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,790
on supermicro motherboards that

114
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,590
malicious piece of firmware is still on

115
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:19,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the supermicro website i use supermicro</font>

116
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,310
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not as sensitive to my</font>

117
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,540
supply chain as Apple is but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

118
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,040
should be worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

119
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,270
thing we all should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be worried about</font>

120
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of thing this was the my</font>

121
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw that month</font>

122
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:39,070
this comes from some people i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in</font>

123
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,580
michigan who added one capacitor to

124
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,620
a small industrial control processor so

125
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,719
this has a CPU it has memory has some<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO</font>

126
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:50,650
drivers and so on and they added one

127
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,930
capacitor and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect of that one</font>

128
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,599
capacitor sorry I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> having some trouble</font>

129
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the sound</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the effect of that one</font>

130
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,160
capacitor is that if you run a certain

131
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,370
data pattern through a certain register

132
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,290
in a certain order at a certain speed it

133
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:09,130
will charge that capacitor to a certain

134
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:13,630
level which will enable the privilege

135
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:17,740
ring so basically it's a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get root</font>

136
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:20,260
access to this chip from user mode just

137
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,110
by running data through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain part</font>

138
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,539
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a certain pattern obviously you</font>

139
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,390
have to know what the pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and</font>

140
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:31,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do you</font>

141
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,669
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard about doing this with</font>

142
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,930
memory sticks where you can run patterns

143
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,520
through adjacent rows in a sim in order

144
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,100
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the contents of adjacent</font>

145
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,159
memory but this is even<font color="#E5E5E5"> better this was</font>

146
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,840
done as a proof of concept because the

147
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,910
way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would go about finding this</font>

148
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,950
if you were let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple and you're</font>

149
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,940
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide whether a given chip</font>

150
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,550
that you were thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

151
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">incorporating into your device have a</font>

152
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,200
problem like this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be x-ray</font>

153
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,860
lithography in other words take the chip

154
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,140
stick it into a microscope<font color="#CCCCCC"> and basically</font>

155
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">use acid get get all the junk off the</font>

156
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,969
chip so you can actually see the wafer

157
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:12,969
and see what's there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the problem is</font>

158
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,880
the capacitor doesn't show up in x-ray

159
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,230
lithography there is not a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

160
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,480
at this and determine that this

161
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:25,390
capacitor is there so when we talk about

162
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,730
verifying our supply chains and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

163
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,520
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other companies that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

love to get some spyware into our

165
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,390
devices or maybe foreign governments or

166
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,740
maybe our own government and you start

167
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,468
<font color="#CCCCCC">to think about how you would actually</font>

168
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,969
verify it it turns out that what the

169
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,669
military does is they make the chips

170
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:45,310
themselves and secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> foundries and</font>

171
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not just the US military that's</font>

172
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,339
any military anywhere because they don't

173
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,290
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that there</font>

174
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,230
devices are responding to signals from

175
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,819
people who are not them and that there

176
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">is only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

177
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,020
to build the whole trip yourself there

178
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,240
just isn't a verification capability

179
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,930
here now there might be one in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

180
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,610
future<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe they'll get more exact</font>

181
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,550
microscopes maybe we'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

182
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually pull this apart and make sure</font>

183
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it really does correspond to the</font>

184
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,660
design that we thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was etched</font>

185
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,100
from but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> then are you going to do</font>

186
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to every chip or you're going to</font>

187
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,430
sample the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lots you're going to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

188
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,680
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a pallet full of these things</font>

189
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,900
how many am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to destroy what will</font>

190
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,910
my costs be to audit that part of my

191
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,280
supply chain and what you start to see

192
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,900
is that even militaries are going to be

193
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,030
spending a<font color="#CCCCCC"> huge amount of money doing</font>

194
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,920
this and apples not going to be able to

195
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:46,470
keep up and apples are pretty rich

196
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:49,500
company so as you if you read the news

197
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:53,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you read a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different throw</font>

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,320
electronic magazines and study the

199
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,000
development of the hardware not just

200
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,470
what feature is new or what the price

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,660
levels are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be or what the</font>

202
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:05,640
density of<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM is going to be you can</font>

203
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,650
find things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and Nico already</font>

204
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,280
mentioned that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the NC</font>

205
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:13,410
if you do a scan of the IPP ipv4 address

206
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,250
space you will find an awful lot of

207
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:20,300
virtual network consoles and quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

208
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those will not have passwords and</font>

209
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,839
part that I didn't hear me go say is

210
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,550
that if you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to notify</font>

211
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,860
people and say hey did you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

212
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,329
can see your<font color="#E5E5E5"> baby sleeping they're more</font>

213
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,560
likely to call the police because they

214
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,060
think you're the problem then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

215
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to call their vendor to find out</font>

216
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:42,109
how to set the password so fixing this

217
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:46,680
is hard so let's do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of math</font>

218
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:49,050
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had a certain complexity in other</font>

219
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,020
words some number of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

220
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of those some small fraction of</font>

221
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,730
them that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

222
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,620
you increase the number on the bottom

223
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,960
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the total</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number of devices you</font>

224
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,760
have without increasing the number on

225
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,020
the top then your total fraction

226
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,020
going to go down your level of

227
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:10,630
understanding of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own equipment base</font>

228
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whatever the inventory is of</font>

229
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,370
your software your hardware your

230
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">device's your network will go down and</font>

231
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:21,610
this seems obvious but a lot of people

232
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,410
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> make buying decisions for large</font>

233
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,260
corporations and even some families

234
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:28,150
can't do math at this level what you're

235
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,460
supposed to do is increase the top as

236
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,560
often as you increase the bottom so that

237
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:37,570
your fraction gets no worse and ideally

238
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:41,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">over time gets better so here's a</font>

239
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,030
security company trend micro and I got

240
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:49,119
nothing against<font color="#CCCCCC"> rent then they've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

241
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:51,189
smart people working there who told us

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,880
all about the hid door controller

243
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:59,530
problem so it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> their bug they were</font>

244
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,930
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> reporting it hid is one of those</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">little things that's next to a door and</font>

you back up to it with your wallet and

it clicks the door then you can you know

we don't know the day we ship it but all

software in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the history community so far</font>

270
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:08,439
has had bugs anybody so so given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

271
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,000
you know that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the case you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people don't so</font>

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,930
and at least in the US economy one of

the most expensive things you can do is

277

buy something for hospital because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

a lot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've been notifying people</font>

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,500
somebody just got angry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said I'm</font>

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple hours see what I</font>

294
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,970
can do third phone call was to the

hospital<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the hospital put in through</font>

302
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,089
an operating room and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we change the</font>

303
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,420
software then the food and drug

304
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,620
administration has to recertify it and

305
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,390
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to happen it's running</font>

306
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,710
windows XP it's always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

307
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,850
running windows XP and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

308
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,710
reasons they couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it off the</font>

309
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,950
network but the point is these devices

310
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:56,020
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of inertia they're hard to</font>

311
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,420
build their hard to maintain<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

312
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:02,680
impossible to patch and they cost a lot

313
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:05,500
and here was a device that was meant to

314
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">control the supply of drugs controlled</font>

315
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,720
substances so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things in</font>

316
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,940
hospitals that are pills that will make

317
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,060
you feel good and so you can sell them

318
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,380
on the open market to people who want to

319
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,890
feel good<font color="#CCCCCC"> even though they were</font>

320
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:24,460
originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended for some medical</font>

321
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:28,449
purpose and so this device was meant to

322
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,250
keep those pills behind essentially tiny

323
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,140
little locked doors and

324
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,510
you had completed some kind of an

325
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,819
auditing protocol to say yes I have a

326
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,520
physician's approval yes I'm authorized

327
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,740
yes I've got the second set of eyes yes

328
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,540
the pills are not going to be sold up in

329
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:50,890
the parking<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot and so on so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

330
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:53,069
device that probably costs I don't know

331
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:56,080
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a rough estimate on it</font>

332
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,910
four hundred thousand US dollars and

333
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,630
it's the size<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apartment</font>

334
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,610
refrigerator and the actual parts cost

335
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,350
the actual and what it took to get the

336
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">metal on the silicon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the chips and so</font>

337
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,730
forth is probably less than one thousand

338
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,079
dollars that so the three hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

339
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,850
ninety-nine thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

340
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it's a medical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device this has a</font>

341
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:18,250
really really high profit margin so if

342
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,800
anybody anywhere was going to have a QA

343
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,570
budget it would be them and they didn't

344
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,579
there were fourteen hundred

345
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,530
vulnerabilities found in just one of

346
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,240
these one<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumes that the others are</font>

347
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,439
now being tested because other people

348
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,630
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to get their names in</font>

349
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:37,240
the paper now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to go on I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

350
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,830
another 40 of these and I have comments

351
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,980
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> about each one but the trend</font>

352
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:44,770
that I hope you're starting to establish

353
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,500
is that things are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting better</font>

354
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:50,980
and the more of this technology that we

355
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,110
push sort of out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lab</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and into our</font>

356
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,790
houses and into hospitals and into

357
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,540
businesses and so forth the less safe

358
00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:00,430
we're becoming I hope to leave you today

359
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,400
with the sense that that trend will

360
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,829
continue until something truly terrible

361
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:12,180
happens because that's the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you</font>

362
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:17,139
can get people's attention when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I first</font>

363
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:21,189
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about open source it was</font>

364
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:24,459
bsd than<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i remember making the</font>

365
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:27,520
point that it's much better to publish

366
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:30,310
your software in terms of the overall

367
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,350
security to publish your software put it

368
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,909
in the hands of everybody and give them

369
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,770
all a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to look for bugs because</font>

370
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be some bad people who</font>

371
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,240
will find some hugs but you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more</font>

372
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">sand eyes more total eyes on your code</font>

373
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,630
and

374
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,049
for more good people who will look at

375
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,080
the code and report bugs in it and this

376
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:52,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the mantra this is what we said</font>

377
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,840
believe it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not operating systems</font>

378
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,820
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to be free and we didn't use</font>

379
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,080
to have the source code to them some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

380
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:02,559
you in the audience look old enough to

381
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember those days and in in those days</font>

382
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,639
we've sometimes faced criticism from

383
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,289
established companies whose operating

384
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,149
systems were not available<font color="#CCCCCC"> in source</font>

385
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,950
code where they would say we're more

386
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:16,518
secure because nobody can look for bugs

387
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:18,350
okay well that ignores disassembly that

388
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,269
ignores fuzz testing that ignores an

389
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:23,928
awful lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff but mostly it just</font>

390
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:25,610
ignores the fact that sunlight is a good

391
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:28,010
disinfectant if you have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

392
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,250
looking at the code it's there you're

393
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,980
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find more bugs faster but that</font>

394
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:38,240
was then and this is now and what we

395
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:41,299
have now is tens hundreds of millions of

396
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,370
lines of source code out there and about

397
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:46,460
the same total number of people looking

398
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,658
at it now as we had in 1995 right

399
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,340
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not all going to go home</font>

400
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spend a bunch of time auditing</font>

401
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,908
source code you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to go</font>

402
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,130
pull out pull down some random tar ball

403
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:56,240
and start poking through it hoping to

404
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">get your name in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the papers you have</font>

405
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">other stuff to do and so the number of</font>

406
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who are actually going to do that</font>

407
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:06,289
is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same as a fixed constant</font>

408
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:07,970
now as it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years ago but the</font>

409
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:11,149
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines of code has gone up by a</font>

410
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:14,299
factor of at least 10 million so we are

411
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:16,639
outnumbered and the old rule where more

412
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:19,490
eyeballs<font color="#CCCCCC"> equaled more security isn't</font>

413
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:20,689
working and i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that trend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

414
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,039
going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back i don't think that</font>

415
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lines are going to cross the other</font>

416
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:27,950
direction again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe those trend</font>

417
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:32,269
lines are relatively level so here we

418
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:34,639
had a linux bot and you know we all know

419
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:36,830
that linux is quite popular and a lot of

420
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:40,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in almost everything</font>

421
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:48,158
it's not particularly bad as code goes

422
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:51,110
but like all code it has bugs apple

423
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:55,340

were millions of dollars of pizza lost

<font color="#CCCCCC">zeros and the thing that people will do</font>

520
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,899
is fairly often they'll see that

521

everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some new thing</font>

00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:13,189
and they'll say I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that too so</font>

523
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:14,719
that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have whatever benefits that I</font>

be left out and antibacterial soaps

527
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:25,830
are literally hand soap that comes in a

528
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,149
dispenser<font color="#CCCCCC"> you push the thing that</font>

529
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,629
squeezes out some like when you wash

530
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:33,268
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> hands but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is impregnated with</font>

531
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:35,519
triclosan which is a chemical<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

532
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:39,210
particularly caustic if you are a single

533
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:43,139
celled animal so if you wash your hands

534
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:44,700
with this stuff then in addition to all

535
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:48,059
the dirt but<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go down the drain you</font>

536
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:50,789
will have a bunch of dead bacteria and

537
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:52,860
the bacteria that stays<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your hands is</font>

538
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:55,559
likely also to be dead so it does give

539
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,799
you some minor bit of safety if bacteria

540
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:01,830
is one of your threat models but here's

541
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:07,769
the problem it only kills the weak

542
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:09,149
bacteria and if you have I guess it

543
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:10,679
doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number here but if you</font>

547
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're now dominating the</font>

else with the weak ones which you

555
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:39,419
helpfully killed in other words you're

making your situation worse one hand

557
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:44,340
wash at a time and there was a moment

558
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:46,860
where this was so fashionable in the

559
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,949
united states that i was unable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

hard this is starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reverse but</font>

when when there is a fad everybody wants

people want to get on it and if it's

566
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:09,090
ultimately bad for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us they don't</font>

567
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,220
care because what they're thinking about

568
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">is oh I've got a house I've got a family</font>

569
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,700
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids I want to kill germs</font>

570
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:16,649
they're not thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the larger</font>

571
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,820
system and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing to</font>

572
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:25,559
ourselves in the digital ecosystem also

573
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:28,139
this is a bit of C code it represents AC

574
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:33,418
library function that has existed since

575
00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:34,168
I guess the late 60s all it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grab</font>

576
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,749
characters

577
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:39,840
from the input stream and append them to

578
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:42,720
the input buffer until it receives

579
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:47,850
either a new line or into file when it

580
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:49,499
returns<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original buffer you should</font>

581
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,939
be able to tell from this if you're not

582
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:52,799
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea programmer and if you're not</font>

583
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,629
familiar with the bug you should still

584
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to tell that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this code does not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know the size of the buffer that was</font>

586
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:04,679
passed to it which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you pass it</font>

587
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:06,539
a 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> by buffer and then it receives 20</font>

588
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,340
bytes worth of input then they're going

589
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:10,109
to be 10 bytes of garbage that are going

590
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,178
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere else in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stack that</font>

591
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:18,269

592
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:20,789
men so this was the entry vector for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

593
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:24,450
very first worm I ever heard of which

594
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:28,590
was the Morris worm 1989<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

595
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:30,899
part of the finger D which is sort of

596
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:35,249
like who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> but for the older bsd</font>

597
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:37,080
systems and yes in those days we enabled

598
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:39,659
all services on every system because we

599
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,019
were crazy but we were on networks that

600
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,950
only had other scientists and government

601
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:45,779
contractors on it so it didn't seem like

602
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,739
the big problem than that it obviously

603
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:51,480
turned into anyway it's a bad idea this

604
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,190
is bad design this should never have

605
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,690
been coated in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place it should</font>

606
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,359
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have made it into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sea</font>

607
00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:00,590

608
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:04,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen so I called it from freebsd and</font>

609
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:06,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">freebsd at the link stage told me you</font>

did<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that almost no c library</font>

613

the output stream of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the warning to say</font>

615
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,269
you should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be calling this thing so</font>

616
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">i gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 character buffer I entered</font>

617
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:26,639
10 characters you see that I had an

618
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,700
overflow variable following my buffer

619
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:33,600
that got filled okay this is nuts this

620
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,940
is crazy stuff this is worse than a lot

621
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the bugs that we see in old programs</font>

written in assembly because<font color="#CCCCCC"> C gives you</font>

623
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,840
this she kind of is a macro assembler in

624
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:44,580
some ways but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gives you this</font>

625
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,928
artificial sense that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

guy still it's just- my comfort zone but

630
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">i figured linux would have got this</font>

631
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,559
right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has a much much bigger</font>

632
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:04,529
user base it's got more eyeballs on it

633
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:07,590
no linux does not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a</font>

634
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:09,539
warning<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux puts into the man page</font>

635
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:14,730
information about why you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should never</font>

636
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:18,029
use get s but if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

637
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:20,460
what you get now there's probably one

638
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:23,250
programmer in a thousand who is going to

639
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,870
read the man page for every function

640
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,639
that they are calling out of this e

641
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,100
library and find out if it's a good or

642
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:31,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">bad idea to use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's probably</font>

643
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">one in a hundred thousand who will look</font>

644
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,340
up the man page in for every function

645
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,230
that is called by code that they are

646
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,389
receiving that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking ownership</font>

647
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,700
rather than that they're writing for the

648
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:44,610
first time in other words this that what

649
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,019
linux is doing is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution to the</font>

650
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,299
problem the solution of the problem is

651
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,460
to take this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> out just have it be</font>

652
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:52,250
the programs that depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it stopped</font>

653
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,690
working but<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody wants to do that</font>

654
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,220
because if you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> where competitors</font>

655
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,409
don't then they're going to have more

656
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,379
customers because those customers are

657
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:07,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have more code that rounds and</font>

658
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:10,949
so I asked Kirk Kirk mcusic who was on

659
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,169
the POSIX committee for the C library so

660
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:16,259
there's an ANSI C librarian as a POSIX

661
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:18,870
thing that came later and he knew I knew

662
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:21,029
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he had known about the Morris worm</font>

663
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:24,899
and I knew he<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew about get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s and I</font>

664
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:28,019
asked him why<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you not pull this out</font>

665
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:30,059
why is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that is why does</font>

666
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,669
this still live why is the still in

667
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,980
computers i can buy today and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

668
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:37,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">well the POSIX people were only willing</font>

669
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,419
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove it the fancy people said that</font>

670
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,580
they would remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and the NC people</font>

671
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,990
wouldn't talk to me I guess the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ANSI</font>

672
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,980
people had other stuff to do than

673
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:52,200
keeping the world safe which we all do I

674
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:54,240
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this quote this is so cool as long</font>

675
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,850
as people write parsers and connect them

676
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,500

industrial control was an HP printer

689
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:34,850
network because the old HP printers came

690
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,650
with a telnet server that had they fixed

691
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,990
buffer and so what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do is over</font>

00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,330
right that fixed buffer with your own

return oriented operating system that

694
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">would turn the printer into a bot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it a lot of capabilities that HP</font>

running on your refrigerator sending

706
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:20,270
spam<font color="#E5E5E5"> for third parties was probably a</font>

707
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,949
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a surprise even though you you're</font>

in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you've been sort of</font>

709
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:28,370
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story unfold for decades</font>

710
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,600
all software as i said earlier has bugs

711
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:33,050
we just don't know what they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font>

712
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,149
sometimes that means that the risk that

713
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:38,540
all of this has in common is our own

714
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:42,890
lack of understanding which comes from

715
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:45,110
unmanaged and unmanageable complexity in

716
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,780
other words we and the people we are

717

protecting are not stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we are</font>

718
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,550
self deceptive we want to put our head

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sand and think our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own thoughts</font>

and not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these facts</font>

721
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:02,419
inconvenient facts intrude on us this is

722
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:05,860
a waveform that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has two purposes it</font>

723
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:08,270
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside of older music synthesizers</font>

724
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,909
every instrument sound in an older

725
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:13,670
synthesizer has one of these so a guitar

726
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,530
sounds different from a piano even if

727
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:20,330
it's playing the same frequency and the

728
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:23,629
difference is this waveform and it has

729
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:28,189
four parts attack decay sustain and

730
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:30,560
release sometimes the sustaining is left

731
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,120
out you just have a dr but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DSR was</font>

732
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,700
kind of the gold standard for a long

733
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,040
time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be repurposed and it was</font>

734
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,110
by a very very smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> man that I met at</font>

faxes they were the number two computer

738

company in the world after IBM in 1988

739
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,030
no one was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain to them why</font>

740
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:57,170
unix and sun microsystems was a threat

744
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:10,340

the curve is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> total lifetime revenue</font>

746
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:16,580
and the top of that curve is created

755
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,030
whatever that is so that your product

756
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:45,830
can't be sold by you or anybody who

757
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:48,140
copied it from you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

758
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:51,560
focused here is what do you what do you

759
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:54,379
control as an innovator you control a

760
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,560
and the others are controlled by your

761
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,270
competitors and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

762
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,640
successful innovator is going to

763
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:05,509
optimize for the steepness and length of

764
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:09,500
the a leg steeper it is the less time

765
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:13,640
and the longer it will fall after it

766
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,260
after it finally reaches<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market you</font>

767
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,060
may be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell from this that</font>

768
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,400
there's no incentive to think about the

769
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,170
safety of your product the people who

770
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,790
are buying innovative stuff want the

771
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,770
innovation they want the bling they want

772
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,200
the extra buttons and lights and things

773
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,630
that blank they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not care</font>

774
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,520
if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost them privacy or if</font>

775
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,560
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help create botnets out of</font>

776
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:38,950
printers and so forth they want the

777
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:43,509
features and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest be damned and that</font>

778
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:46,430
that won't change there's no amount of

779
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:49,130
reprogramming we can do to the market

780
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:52,819
environment to get rid of this the

781
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,490
people who focus on a are going to be

782
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,810
buying the assets out of bankruptcy of

783
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:06,020
the people who focused on anything but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

784
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:08,690
that's economic Darwinism so I gave a

785
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,990
variation of this talk about a year ago

786
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:15,710
at the hackers conference in in

787
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:18,109
California and somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> got up and said</font>

788
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:20,900
hi I'm Dustin so and I'm a grad student

789
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:22,700
at Stanford<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just don't see the</font>

790
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,510
problem right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things have</font>

791
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:29,210
always worked and we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine and I</font>

792
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:32,089
put this slide in just for him we hold

793
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:34,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">the field in which I grow my fox lay</font>

794
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:37,730
thine eyes upon it and thou shalt see

795
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:39,560
that it is barren the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

796
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:42,920
the thing that's popular among the

797
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,109
twenty-something set is to to say zero

798
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,079
fucks given sorry if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> offending</font>

799
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:51,170
anybody with<font color="#CCCCCC"> my language but the idea is</font>

800
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:56,210
that the less you care the cooler you

801
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:57,470
are and I guess that's another reason

802
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,750
why we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font>

00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:03,529

805
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,650
hope I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I'm that by talking</font>

806
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,680
to you about it I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you</font>

had<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick time for windows because they</font>

849
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted the QuickTime format to take off</font>

850
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,250
I didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be something you had</font>

851
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">to buy a mac or I don't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if the</font>

852
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,660
iphone existed at that time but didn't

853
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:07,640
want you to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own an apple product</font>

855
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,049

856
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would play these things for you in</font>

the dead bugs all<font color="#E5E5E5"> software has bugs and</font>

858
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,990
I guess Apple wasn't as comfortable

859
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,910
programming in Windows as they were in

860
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:25,640
other environments and so maybe they had

861
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">some extra books but it had</font>

862
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,868
vulnerability after a vulnerability if

863
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,700
you look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CBE history on an apple</font>

864
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:33,560
quicktime for windows you'll see that

865
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,980
it's a mess it's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than my</font>

866
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:39,020
stuff but then here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem when</font>

867
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,790
they finally gave up they just announced

868
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a press release</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there would be</font>

869
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:45,529
no more patches<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the total number of</font>

870
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,690
people who saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> press release and</font>

871
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,940
said oh I'm running that I better delete

872
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,040
it and not you know have that feature on

873
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,520
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows system anymore is a grand</font>

874
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,190
total of zero

875
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,230
so we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this permanent</font>

876
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,300
infrastructure of code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has known</font>

877
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:03,450
vulnerabilities on it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will live</font>

878
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:05,880
until ultraviolet radiation finally

879
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,680
kills off the plastic case of whatever

880
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,270
computers have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this software in it and</font>

881
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,819
people finally replace them because they

882
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,890
look bad I really think Apple could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

883
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,290
done us a favor<font color="#CCCCCC"> by announcing one last</font>

884
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:18,420
patch that would disable the whole thing

885
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:23,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">and make it delete itself but that would</font>

886
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:27,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">have had liability problems finally I</font>

887
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:29,130
was on a website and it said you know

888
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:30,930
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other articles like the one</font>

889
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:34,680
you're reading database configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

891
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,600
million targeted voter records exposed

892
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,400
by database error and it asked me do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

893
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,330
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like this and I realized I'm</font>

894
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:49,200
going to get more like this we all are

895
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:51,180
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um it's true that most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the money</font>

896
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,980
being made by the services we consume is

897
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,980
through advertising but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't just</font>

898
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,840
advertising there are companies who do

899
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,550
their capacity planning based on how

900
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,130
many buyers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain type of thing</font>

901
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,280
exists in a certain region sometimes

902
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:07,200
they're planning on taking away your

903
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,330
alternatives so that you'll drive the

904
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,859
cost of some grocery that you have to

905
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,440
have like you know milk or something

906
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that up by a few pennies and they</font>

907
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,400
can do that by buying metadata from

908
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,939
Facebook and Google to find out exactly

909
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:24,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the buyers of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those products are</font>

910
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:27,330
and so what you'll see is that there's

911
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,270
extreme value in knowing what other

912
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:33,060
people are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do or what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

913
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:35,660
done and it doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

intelligence corporate even religious

916
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,569
and political people need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who we</font>

917
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:51,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">are and what we're like and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

918
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:54,990
likely to do and any actual autonomy or

919
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:58,590
actual privacy that any of us have is a

920
00:41:54,990 --> 00:42:02,939
threat to those interests and that's why

921
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:05,820
there's so much pressure on sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

922
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,320
getting our data out there right there

923
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,370
is nobody but you

<font color="#E5E5E5">if it's if you have privacy so we are</font>

925
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:16,500
certainly going to be increasing the

926
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:21,060
size of the attack surface as we have

927
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,680
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's I think we've reached a pretty</font>

928
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,170
steep part of the curve and expecting a

929
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:30,299
million time increase in the attack

930

surface in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year or two and if</font>

931
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:35,340
an IOT device is not phoning home it's

932
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,399
not telling if you have a thermostat

933
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:41,100
that's not telling nest or some

934
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,640
manufacturer when you change<font color="#CCCCCC"> your tongue</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're the temperature of your house</font>

then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again that company is going to die</font>

937
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,690
from corporate Darwinism because if

938
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,549
you're making a light bulb for example

939
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:55,710
and sticking an IOT controller in it

940
00:42:53,550 --> 00:43:00,480
you're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make back your rd</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">cost on just the profit you made from</font>

942
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,380
selling the device as a commodity people

943
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,410
are price sensitive about their light

944
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,960
bulbs but if you can then put those

945
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">people into a social network then that's</font>

946
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,200
where your profits going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:16,200
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is the companies that</font>

devices it will be all of the backups

953
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,300
everything this is supporting that

954
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:34,320
device behind the scenes is going to be

955
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:38,490
as insecure as the device itself do we

956
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:42,390
think that IOT devices will be patched I

957
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:49,259
don't I wish that there were laws about

958
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:51,000
that I think for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could have</font>

959
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,890
them expire the device hasn't been

960
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,470
patched in a couple of years it<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped</font>

961
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:57,390
working if its industrial an industrial

962
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,879
control device you should have a timer

963
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,589
in it or it blinks red for a month and

964
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">then finally just says I'm sorry I won't</font>

965
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,430
take any more commands because i haven't

966
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,830
been patched recently enough because all

967
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,120
software has bugs you just don't know

968
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they are at the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were</font>

shipped and I don't see regulation as

970
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:19,860
much of a hope so let me say i have

971
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,339
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 of these which i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

to do justice to but I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

974
00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:32,099
d-link 400,000 IOT devices and here's an

975
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,799
MRI machine I've actually had a brain

976
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:38,249
MRI for various reasons and I find it

977
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:40,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">fascinating that the results of that MRI</font>

are now cast in doubt because of

979
00:44:40,529 --> 00:44:45,210
vulnerabilities and bugs that were found

00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:27,479
this was so cool tp-link had some device

configuration domains where every device

995
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:32,489
they had made would do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS lookup in</font>

00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:34,319
order to discover its configuration they

997

lay didn't pay the bill and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

could if you made a movie that had a

side door and scan the memory images of

1009

them that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was this and this was</font>

00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:20,788
fixed 108 bugs but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means I have a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">single thing I can tell you is figure</font>

out the real total cost of ownership

1041

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase the top side of that</font>

1044

fraction so that your understanding

1045
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:35,930
level does not go down over time because

1046
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:38,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is that understanding level and the</font>

1047
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:42,890
the gradual trend downward of that that

1048
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:46,370
is the real fundamental element of

1049
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:48,759
insecurity and if you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1050
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:52,460
secure it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be harder to use</font>

1051
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:55,160
right the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't put really</font>

1052
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:57,470
expensive really nice locks on their

a window it's the day themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't</font>

1055
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:05,600
use a lock<font color="#E5E5E5"> that requires enough</font>

procedural getting in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the door</font>

1057
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,020
that it would actually be secure they

1058
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,370
want to press one<font color="#E5E5E5"> button and they want</font>

1060
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:22,160
that's where all these Bluetooth flocks

1061
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:24,520
are coming from so I'm open for

1062
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,520
questions

[Applause]

1064
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,680
I've said a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of controversial things</font>

1065
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,960
I intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provoke some of you to</font>

1066
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:59,828
disagree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me please don't disappoint</font>

1067
00:48:49,960 --> 00:49:04,450
I have a hi hi hello hello I have a one

1068
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:07,960
quick question who will pay for this I

1069
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:11,230
mean if you have to put the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1070
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,349
IOT oh IC devices that are this small

1071
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:19,780
and this chip who will pay for these

1072
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:22,359
lenders<font color="#CCCCCC"> governments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people as I tried to</font>

1073
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,880
explain there is no model other than

1074
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:29,619
regulation that would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause</font>

1075
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:31,839
that money to be spent up front so it's

1076
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:35,230
possible in Europe that since regulation

1077
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:36,640
is not the evil curse word that it is in

1078

the united<font color="#CCCCCC"> states that you could do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">something here that might have some</font>

1080
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,940
impact around the world but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1081
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:49,540
what's more likely is that these bending

1082
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:54,280
will occur after the fact and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think if</font>

1083
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:56,410
there's any hope of sort of tempering

1084
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,800
this before it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really grows out of</font>

1085
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,990
bounds and we get a major collapse it

would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the insurance industry because</font>

1087
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:05,828
they are going to start to understand

that these cars aren't safe for that

the number of people willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay more</font>

them that they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this wrong is</font>

1134
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:24,400
hard it's very hard to tell somebody who

1135
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:25,960
has been tripping and falling in piles

1136
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:33,540
of money their whole life that they've

<font color="#CCCCCC">been doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong una pregunta mas una</font>

1138
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,069
hold on

1139
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:54,180
hola thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for the</font>

1140
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:57,660
presentation I guess there's no hope but

1141
00:52:54,180 --> 00:53:01,440
if there's some hope in the cloud or the

1142
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:06,589
cloud vs IOT or something like that what

1143
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:11,160
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think thank you well I think that</font>

1144
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:14,490
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> had another Amazon adage s3</font>

1145
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:17,250
outage this week and we found out how

1146
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:20,459
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we do online depend on</font>

1147
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:22,440
amazon for their backing store back to

1148
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Amazon's own status page depends on</font>

1149
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:29,550
amazon for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red blinky thing so</font>

1150
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:33,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why it's dave green so the cloud</font>

1151
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:34,980
tends to be operated<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the best of the</font>

1152
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:37,558
best it's the cream of the crop in terms

1153
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:40,470
of who is designing it and who is

1154
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:44,089
maintaining it and it does not face the

1155
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:47,040
same race to the bottom sort of

1156
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:49,259
commoditization of technology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1157
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,400
computers we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually buy and put in</font>

1158
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:55,829
our buildings or our pockets will do

1159
00:53:52,400 --> 00:54:01,319
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything has limits and there</font>

1160
00:53:55,829 --> 00:54:03,859
is because of the dependency problems it

1161
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:07,230
ends up being<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the impact of a bug</font>

1162
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:11,609
is very large<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> frequency of</font>

1163
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:15,630
such bugs is very small and so the at

1164
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:18,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> equilibrium point a cloud operator</font>

1165
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:20,640
or a cloud customer is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing</font>

1166
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:22,460
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a non cloud operator</font>

1167
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,960
non cloud customer would do which is

1168
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,180
minimizing their spending they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1169
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,270
to invest the bare minimum of whatever

1170
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:33,270
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend either in capital or</font>

1171
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:35,520
expense to get their job done and in

1172
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,650
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find and then maintain that</font>

1173
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,960
equilibrium they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1174
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,940
steer into troubled waters from time to

1175
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:46,440
time to prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1176
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:50,579
lower so my answer is no there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1177
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:53,760
hope coming to us from the cloud there

1178
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:57,930
would be hope for the small number of

1179
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,990
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who can tolerate the wackiness of</font>

1180
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,680
open-source software certainly there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1181
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:03,979
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac</font>

1182
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,620
our capability in<font color="#E5E5E5"> LibreOffice to</font>

1183
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:09,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">correspond to what Microsoft put in but</font>

1184
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,220
there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of I can't use</font>

1185
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,260
LibreOffice in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> daily work and you</font>

1186
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:16,859
probably can't either so most people

1187
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:20,220
can't tolerate the the reduction in

1188
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:22,700
feature that comes along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with having</font>

1189
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:26,040
greater understanding or greater control

1190
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:31,129
so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as I can tell we're going to</font>

1191
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:33,660
stay right<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the edge of calamity</font>

1192
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:42,050
except for the days that we steer into

1193
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:42,049
calamity<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you so much</font>
