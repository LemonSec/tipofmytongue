10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,340
we've decided to share it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,550
because there will be many changes in

know what our opinion is about that we

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,670
have a lot of talent in Spain but

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,400

how money comes in and now clear hell

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,360
basically it's the cost of this room

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,119
when you complain about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the price just</font>

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,869
think about this would you like to the

29
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,900
event to take place in a car park with

30
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:58,100
some

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,140
loud speakers will you rather be here in

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,199
a nice room like this that's the

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,030
consequence of this well we need to have

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,800
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact on the price of the ticket as</font>

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,140
you can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the expenses</font>

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,859
we incur we believe we have fulfilled

37
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:15,589
our mission after eight years organizing

38
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,400
this event we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's many</font>

39
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,600
events out there there's many projects a

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,050
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things happen in Spain done</font>

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,480
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen before we are aiming and</font>

42
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,940
becoming a catalyst for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> change and</font>

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,840
we believe we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful</font>

44
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,520
personally speaking I have to say I'm

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">very proud of the work we're done but so</font>

46
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,180
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> so good now it's another stage we</font>

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,209
need to make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what to do</font>

48
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,980
with the project so that way you'll have

49
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to keep evolving and about home very</font>

50
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,649
importantly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the customer it</font>

51
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,420
seems that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer might not be</font>

52
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,870
right but deep down the customer is

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:56,480
always right you always are right so it

54
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:01,090
might feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're not listening but</font>

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,730
we are always so evolution stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1</font>

multitrack<font color="#E5E5E5"> room 19 is also available</font>

57
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:14,179
we'll see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes how it feels for</font>

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,680
people or not we will do<font color="#CCCCCC"> their our best</font>

price we've changed the discount scheme

61
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:22,370
there's no discounts for students their

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,300
discounts for people under 24 and those

63
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,290
students who want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a discount</font>

improve it but it's gone quite well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

69
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:42,080
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do being in control</font>

70
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,610
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of sponsors not having</font>

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">too many sponsors is an important thing</font>

72
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">why because at the end of the day they</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> committed to your project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

enough money through sponsorships so

78
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:14,780
there's no financial risks organizing an

79
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:17,570
event like this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> item here in such a</font>

80
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,209
way that you're getting yes enough money

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one hand so you're not diluting</font>

82

the image of anyone okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's</font>

83
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,520
money coming from sponsors but also

coming money coming from you that's

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,500
important stage two of the evolution

86
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,479
will listen to you it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> well see</font>

are indeed paying attention to what you

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:41,570
say we may agree we may disagree but I

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:44,690
can guarantee we're always listening we

91
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:47,419
have evolved into another stage stage

this application what is crude right

179
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:02,690
where you can move the balance from your

180
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:06,619
mobile phone to someone else so they

181
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:09,620
credit you go I got to know them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT</font>

elapsed really quickly but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you want</font>

qualify to be accepted but anyway we

348

several cities and we mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

354
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:08,010
of organizing something shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> screening</font>

355
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,540
at the same time in several venues we'll

356
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,430
have to see whether that works in the

357
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,800
next month<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's more security than</font>

365
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,210

00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:42,860
channels will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> different because it's</font>

426
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,780
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> different but ok we'll go back</font>

427
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">to technical things with the script some</font>

428
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:51,740
of the ideas that he's got on his mind

429
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:54,950
thank you again curiosity by the way the

430
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">event short films moves very quickly at</font>

431
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,380
first when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote a script it was much</font>

432
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:03,470
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we we thought it would be</font>

433
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">great as a 45 minute episode like like</font>

434
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:10,970
mirror or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

435
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:13,430
what sort of perhaps approaching someone

436
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:16,070
I'm making it become a chapter for the

437
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:29,900
TV show well if anybody is interested we

438
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:32,270
could do black mirror episode 7 quoi les

439
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,370
llama<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the</font>

440
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,770
biggest difficulty that you have on

441
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,709
shooting

442
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,690
the biggest difficulty and the anecdote

443
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:49,500
you will tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like saying fuck</font>

444
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:56,020
my god ancilla tilia student lounge

445
00:25:49,500 --> 00:26:00,520
shell-shocked in that sentence<font color="#E5E5E5"> wicked so</font>

446
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:03,040
we took 30 shots of that technically

447
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:07,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">speaking the main difficulty with having</font>

448
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,510
small teams few people on board in LA I

449
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,190
do have people I have a big team but we

450
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:15,280
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the lean and we were alone and</font>

451
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,960
we had to get hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> of friends but we</font>

452
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically had to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and he'll</font>

453
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:24,130
think he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> only two of us so holding</font>

454
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:28,120
the boom mixing the sound holding the

455
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:30,220
jig you put the cat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

456
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,169
jig and go to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side and it's</font>

457
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:38,310
very difficult to go for focus that's

458
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:40,720
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that type of things other than that</font>

459
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:43,120
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all these people was great</font>

460
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:48,700
everyone contributed whichever way they

461
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:50,409
wanted there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something right it was</font>

462
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:54,970
something by funny there was someone

463
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:58,950
playing the general in theory that had

464
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,950
to be some of that resemble the real guy

465
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,830
but as it happens when you do a project

466
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:10,189
of this sort where actors are paid with

467
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:12,500
food that's it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just cannot</font>

468
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,230
under cannot afford anything else we

469
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,540
were waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the actor for the</font>

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:21,110
shooting he was more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 60 miles away</font>

471
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:25,250
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shooting so we didn't have an</font>

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:28,850
excerpt<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that scene so a friend of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lock release called someone we gave</font>

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:37,610
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say this and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we made</font>

476
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:39,800
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that was 40 minutes because we</font>

477
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:42,290
only had a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little time window for</font>

00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> studio set one of the main problems</font>

479
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously with the lack of money we</font>

480
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:53,178
needed to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everything</font>

481
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:55,190
everything was some right first I'm

482
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:57,260
talking about security the most

483
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,480
complicated thing is that regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

484
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,670
what you write<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> script if then the</font>

485
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,429
actors are<font color="#E5E5E5"> use different sentences use</font>

486
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:07,700
different words and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

487
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:09,170
see the footage today after you realize

488
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,440
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something different not</font>

489
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:14,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens when there's no budget to go</font>

490
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,480
back to shooting a scene again well you

491
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:21,610
have to make do that was some not

492
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:24,410
complicated to make meaning of the story

493
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:27,649
despite<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the footage that have been</font>

494
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:33,710
recorded that was a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a source of</font>

495
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:36,679
anxiety for me a question towards the

496
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,600
public making cinema like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the making</font>

497
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:44,830
films like this is hacking it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

498
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially when you don't have any money</font>

499
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:54,919
at the end of the day hackers not

500
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,949
hackers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has doesn't have to do with</font>

501
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:00,740
their computers or criminals this is

502
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,270
about putting together something with

503
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,270
the little money you've got you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

504
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:08,660
be creative you have to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pieces</font>

505
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the puzzle that you've got at your</font>

506
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,370
fingertips but with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very limited</font>

507
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:17,990
budget yet you really have to make em

508
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:20,419
speed so we go into tips and tricks if

509
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,010
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> find if you found out what happened</font>

510
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,650
behind the scenes it's quite striking

511
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,570
there's been a lot of hacking involved

512
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:31,700
in the film I'm not part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this world</font>

513
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:34,340
but I realized the important thing here

514
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,830
is that people have 20 30 40 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

515
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:41,530
experience they know so much stuff they

516
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,530
make it happen about<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

517
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,350
well I would agree this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font>

518
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:58,700
creativity creativity is hacking after

519
00:29:51,350 --> 00:30:00,980
all so in that sense it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well any</font>

520
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:04,670
more questions from the floor anyone

521
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:10,610
courageous enough to race down the hand

522
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:12,800
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't see you will you</font>

523
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,250
please turn the lights on for the entire

524
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,250
room

525
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:30,280
when a premier<font color="#CCCCCC"> level price first of all</font>

526
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,560
congratulations for your project my

527
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,960
question is right about the title will

528
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:39,700
you please elaborate on it tell us why I

529
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:44,800
do have chosen that title right it comes

530
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:47,760
from something that was said in that one

531
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,889
area because when the sky is cloudy

532
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:55,270
military drones can fly there for that

533
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:58,660
makes it a secure area so it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

534
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:01,960
related to the contents of the clip in

535
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:06,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning we thought about chapter</font>

536
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:10,630
of longer series so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> title is about</font>

537
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">somatic its intended of giving feeling</font>

538
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:19,270
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> danger were security but it is</font>

539
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:22,000
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not disclose anything or about the</font>

540
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:24,520
con center so there is no direct

541
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,640
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> well them in the beginning</font>

542
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,280
we could have found a link with what

543
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,310
happened in Syria in 2013 and that's

544
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:36,370
where these statement comes from when

545
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:40,419
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boy said that he was</font>

546
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:44,770
happy on cloudy days so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had had</font>

547
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:48,310
more time and if we could have drawn on

548
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:50,500
what was happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Syria well that's</font>

549
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:54,340
where the name came up and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

550
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:57,790
due<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some issues well we could add s</font>

551
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,860
dwell on that or thrown that so once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

552
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,610
said she says we wanted it to be

553
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:06,699
thematic we wanted it to kind of fat

554
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:10,629
should chapters related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this topic</font>

555
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:17,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">and yes we would have been some</font>

556
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:21,639
interesting to have just two chapters

557
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:29,559
writes very very very last question no

558
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:46,408
questions all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you very happy</font>

559
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:46,408
thank you very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>
