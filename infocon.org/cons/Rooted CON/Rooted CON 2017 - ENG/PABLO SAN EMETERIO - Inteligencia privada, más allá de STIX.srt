they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this double track once more</font>

lancia big big applause with them

<font color="#E5E5E5">Nico's presentation so he had been</font>

26
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:45,020
interesting ideas to share with us the

27
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,799
first one being over I think I forgotten

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">now i can remember right that I think he</font>

29
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,099
told<font color="#CCCCCC"> us about IOT which is very trendy</font>

30
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:59,390
now we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to have many things</font>

00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:02,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are connected as well as in an is</font>

32
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:06,729
and secure manner and he gave us a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

33
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:09,859
good chips to tackle that which is

34
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:12,019
regulation so we are not expecting to

35
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,049
get an electrical shock from

36
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:17,120
refrigerator or a washing machine we

37
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:21,010
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not expect that our life becomes</font>

public when we just buy one of these

39
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:28,010
devices also another is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relevant</font>

40
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,260
idea from his presentation where the

cyber weapons to cyber weapons that are

42
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:42,138
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> here they are affordable</font>

43
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:44,930
efficient and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you can deny</font>

compared with reducing b-52 ligand

system game I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how much it</font>

47
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:56,780
will cost to use a b-52 and I believe

48
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">field will be more or less the same</font>

and answer session when someone asked

54
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,680
Angie said that there at the type of

errors sometimes error comes from code

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,540
the source code is vulnerable is easy

57
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:29,599
you open it to fix it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and one less blue</font>

58
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,959
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program comes from humans as I said</font>

59
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,230
we cannot open up people's brain

60
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,140
and we program it so that they stop

61
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:42,070
clicking what they shouldn't click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

62
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:45,750
execute an open and grant programs were

to download free apps which are never

64
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:55,390
fully free and I agree with what he said

65
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,000
but I disagree with what he said about

66
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:02,109
them that we have to wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,780
generation to fix that by generation

with their security they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not protect</font>

76
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,929
their security and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to die so that things become</font>

78
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,010
secure but in general his presentation

79
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,960
was very good and I liked it very much I

80
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:42,190
liked what he said about sudden weapons

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:49,620
and IOT specifically so the origin of my

82
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:53,020
presentation comes from two references

83
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:59,140
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> worlds of security one of them</font>

being<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roman I met remand in the Masters</font>

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,460
really impressed me silver monthly from

page I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that region Khan has a room</font>

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,570
that is to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organizers do</font>

90
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,470
not give presentations understands so

91
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:26,469
part of this presentation and sorcery

92
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,980

years in<font color="#CCCCCC"> telefonica then he left</font>

Sam to work on cyber espionage and then

121
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:47,680
to come up with techniques to fight the

122
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:51,250
evil guys this is like I took it from

123
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cab it so this is one has happened</font>

124
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,820
in the last 16 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited</font>

125
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,510
technologies and the elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

126
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,820
seen with<font color="#CCCCCC"> statutes and packing the 2,000</font>

focusing on perimeter some<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies and</font>

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">see doing that events</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 years later</font>

129
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:17,080
they mean 2004 we've started to focus on

130
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:19,600
monitoring later on on 2006 so we could

131
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,280
see that cable access gave access to

132
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,640
everyone so therefore was needed to

133
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,099
something in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> regards then in 2008</font>

134
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,680
we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss data and</font>

135
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,910
illustrations and then in 2010 we

136
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,200
started to talk about strength

137
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,780
intelligence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to say people</font>

selling<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOC's to us that having come</font>

00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,929
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a compromise before 04 09 2013 we</font>

140
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:45,580
had the height to share everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

141
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:48,790
everyone but resist that I was lucky

enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend an event one half years</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is interesting because we came up with a</font>

00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,689
if you had a virus from popcorn you

could retrieve the passwords they were

in developing malware this is yours do

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,600
are human they are children are problems

288
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,630
with the budget they sleep they have

289
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,870
challenges themselves and this slide is

290
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:37,250
very revealing in that sense this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

291
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:40,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">pyramid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of pain the bad ones also have a</font>

292
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:44,360
pyramid obtained for themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> so based</font>

293
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:48,370
on the location<font color="#E5E5E5"> you touch</font>

294
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:52,600
you harm them more or less hash values

295
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:57,680
changing a binary and making it work

296
00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">this trivial once they detect that the</font>

297
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,469
binary has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> detected they change the</font>

298
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:08,750
hash and keep attacking you that's

299
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:12,470
trivial if we go up into the pyramid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

300
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,300
pain we have IP addresses if you detect

301
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:18,170
an IP address from the malware and you

302
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,029
block it it's relatively easy for them

303
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:23,599
to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a bit</font>

304
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:26,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">more than changing the hash on the same</font>

305
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">ghost of the main things if you go up</font>

306
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,069
one level and you just tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the main</font>

307
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:33,920
name people's cost them a little bit

308
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,170
more than changing the IP and here we

309
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,899
get to a place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really bothered</font>

310
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:44,329
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay network or traces or samples</font>

311
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:47,209
that we can collect if you for example

312
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:49,399
if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad one if the bunny has programs</font>

313
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:53,000
an attack and in order to communicate is

314
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,980
using HTTPS or HTTP under header with

315
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,350
the user agents is saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are using</font>

316
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Firefox on windows 7 and you know that</font>

317
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,740
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no windows 7 in your company</font>

318
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">because everyone is running at windows 8</font>

319
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,589
you have an element to detect the bad

320
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:08,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones you will be detecting the bad one</font>

321
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,240
even if they change everything else but

322
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,179
they don't know what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

323
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:19,609
it could be a directory where files are

324
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:23,179
stored or in the other element one step

325
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:25,520
farther up obviously if things get more

326
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,990
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> it makes its life more</font>

327
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,820
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them but the more</font>

328
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:33,140
difficult to detect from from outside

329
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:35,960
tools being able to detect the tools are

330
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,790
using being able to know the compilers

331
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:43,190
are using the offensive tools are using

332
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,590
all of that I mean we're all human and

333
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,720
we use a range of tools in our work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

334
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,889
use one compiler more than any other and

335
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,870
what I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one it</font>

336
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,260
bothers<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it bothers me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm not</font>

337
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> skilful for the other one</font>

338
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:59,610
and then there are films we prepare over

339
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:02,340
some other tools having to move from

340
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,250
Python truly or from Python to curl will

341
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,139
cost them people harm them and last but

342
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,300
not least at the very top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that period</font>

343
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pain which is a difficult to reach</font>

344
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,820
that's where you really harm them here's

345
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,669
where we talked about tactics and

346
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:22,169
procedures well you know that a group

347
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:25,140
attacking you always uses a search for

348
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:29,370
the sysadmin they send<font color="#E5E5E5"> an office file</font>

349
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:32,040
with another of macros and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

350
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:36,379
do it on a friday at around three in the

351
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,379
morning so catch this is admin at home

352
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:43,350
well then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an elevator not you</font>

353
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,480
you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who who it is and</font>

354
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,649
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing so it's going back</font>

355
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,140
for a minute to that slide on<font color="#CCCCCC"> trends</font>

356
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:54,150
plus 2013 on let's share everyone

357
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,740
started sharing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to have a</font>

358
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,140
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of this you have a little bit</font>

359
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:03,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that gave me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few hashes I'll give</font>

360
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:07,190
you a few IP so we shared tons of the

361
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:12,510
news if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look towards the end</font>

362
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:16,080
2216 let's generate for intelligence use

363
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:20,450
around mid-2016 bit so with the end of

364
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,530
that he advanced so we move from sharing

365
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:27,690
billions of tons of things with other

366
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:28,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">contexts to start using our own things</font>

367
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,680
that with the things that are impacting

368
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,970
us or things coming from attack is so

369
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,970
changing paradigm relief

370
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:47,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">so an interesting idea using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that type</font>

371
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:50,419
of things what can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to try and</font>

372
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:58,760
generate some private intelligence how

373
00:19:50,419 --> 00:20:01,460
about putting something on Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

374
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,080
blocking everything by a forceful day so

375
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block by</font>

376
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">default and I will analyze it and see if</font>

377
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:13,729
I can allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute it or not and</font>

378
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:18,409
the other hand we have the evolution of

379
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:22,850
the project<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware in version 2 in</font>

380
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:24,620
that come full project or malware for

381
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,049
this if you haven't heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this let</font>

382
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">me explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a project based</font>

383
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">on an idea which was not news</font>

384
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,250
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt it was a new thing we</font>

385
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,900
thought we were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sexiest guys on</font>

386
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,669
earth but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we realized that it was</font>

387
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,870
not wasn't the case but he kinda

388
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,900
reminded us though there were some

389
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,059
academic papers back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2008 talking</font>

390
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,280
about these solutions come for malware

391
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:49,190
what what is this all about now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what has</font>

392
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,240
evolved since the very first time when

393
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,890
malware was created because of ego stuff

394
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,900
when people try to prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

395
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,600
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than anyone else it moved to with</font>

396
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,789
a side of money till<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cashman's the main</font>

397
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,480
goal there was to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> money infecting</font>

398
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:08,150
computers hiding so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

399
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,940
remain undetected even attacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> states</font>

400
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:14,090
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> marwa started implementing a lot of</font>

401
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:17,330
invasive<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques evasive the heat</font>

402
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from analysis techniques and</font>

403
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:24,350
sandbox techniques so then we thought

404
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:26,689
about how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a normal computer</font>

405
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,549
becoming analysis and Bible a lot would

406
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:32,390
be deactivated but we found a weak point

407
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:34,220
we found<font color="#CCCCCC"> a week for what do you do with</font>

408
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,650
those that don't hide with those that

409
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,370
attack directly how I run somewhere that

410
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,370
attacks directly

411
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,670
and doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about whether they own</font>

412
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:50,050
an analysis environment so the first

413
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:55,190
answer they came to my mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> was well</font>

414
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:58,430
we'll see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the sandbox for sure we</font>

415
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,790
have a sandbox in the night table and

416
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:03,290
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just waiting to get attacked and</font>

417
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,610
merchants with little shops in the High

418
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:08,690
Street have a sound box as well

419
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:10,909
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just joking so we were</font>

420
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,010
a bit bothered by that weak points we

421
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:16,790
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve it and then that is thought</font>

422
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to thinking he said how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we stop</font>

423
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:22,909
the process with right to a

424
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,230
communications point and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

425
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,940
communication point you have a lot of

426
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,940
security solutions that will determine

427
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,010
what that thing is doing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> new about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this vendors</font>

vendors do communication between

different solutions that still then does

that leather do it but this is based on

445
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:31,370
proprietary technology so that you have

457
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:08,239
do it again every day so let's go for 20

458
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:11,750
30 60 days perhaps but you set up a

because i didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the time to finish</font>

472
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:13,340
everything for all solutions I didn't

473
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,630
have the time for all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's a</font>

477
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:28,010
need to move beyond bad okay this is a

478
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:33,020
very preliminary stage I mean we have an

479
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:37,850
interpreter here we will have BBQ

480
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:41,360
executing things here right here we have

481
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows and this is part they got a</font>

482
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:49,689

free

484
00:25:51,779 --> 00:26:01,830
you open it up and here where you

execute if you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mesolithic</font>

please II

487
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,610
over the windows

488
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,709
how to go to the driver I'll tell you

489
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:30,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that eat a later on about what it</font>

490
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:30,570
does exactly and if I can move it

491
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:42,679
I'm having<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a pain with a bundle are</font>

492
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,380
you launch it and this is suspended you

493
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:51,230
could have killed it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> she knew both</font>

494
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:55,880
militias and now the bad one the body

495
00:26:51,230 --> 00:27:04,310
doesn't have anything so I have stopped

496
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:06,670
a bob from clicking everywhere how does

497
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:09,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that do this well this is a linux riser</font>

498
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:14,030
so for the care for they win the skin

499
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:18,199
rule there's a call back at that point

500
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:19,990
in time you call<font color="#CCCCCC"> a healing function in</font>

501
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,260
the kernel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> starts the process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

502
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:25,880
then let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not use the space so that we</font>

503

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:57,990
when the client is of line what happens

547
00:29:53,180 --> 00:30:01,290
good question here we have a number of

548
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:03,750
things we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resolve you might let</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">me enhance what they charge is offline</font>

what it does it gets locks nothing is

551
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:13,880
executed so you can have something like

552
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:13,879
a local cache where whatever is allowed

553
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,450
absolutism due to too many things<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

the company user name but with the local

555
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:27,630

556
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:30,390
allowed to execute<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that you have</font>

00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,090
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to implement a folder</font>

564

well you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a white list of what</font>

565
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,139
can be modified by a document so that

using obviously something is wrong so

572
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:12,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is that you fear of line you</font>

577
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,820
and then you come back home and realize

578
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:30,389
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things were suspended</font>

579
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:31,950
suspensions are deliberate so that you

580
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,230
can see in the process explorer you

581
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,770
should kill it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay rather than</font>

suspended

583
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:46,029
and I'm sorry I'm jumping in because I

584
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:46,029
don't want to give you a talk

585
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:58,830
this is one thing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> question casual</font>

prevent him from filling the run with

prevent that compulsive behavior

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,908
you mentioned on emulating in normal

delete<font color="#CCCCCC"> the MBR and that's it yeah</font>

619
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,080
it's about blocking everything that

starts at the beginning before executing

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,429
the very first instructions if we detect

any behavior on the sandbox disappears

623
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:53,420
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would not give a yes answer to I</font>

00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,970
the problem is that someone would sorry

00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,530
find your solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I cited except</font>

this is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial product we're</font>

legitimate for the dll has<font color="#CCCCCC"> being cooked</font>

634
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,409
deliberately there's also another

tells you whenever the other is<font color="#E5E5E5"> maps</font>

640
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,390
another question right there

641
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:59,000
the question how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you concentrated how</font>

to make this grow within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

643
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,040

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,460
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> at work but if a company with</font>

40,000 computers downloading software I

646
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,700
mean if you expect this to be applied to

647
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:13,819
every one every single computer is this

648
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,368
extremely complex I mean not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:21,650
me more details well i just turned here

651
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:23,839
you may have a net this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

652
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,500
with 40,000 employees who are executing

653
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,299
different fashions of software ok you we

654
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,089
can sign them we can verify them

655
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,730
whatever but unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's my</font>

656
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:40,549
experience many uses that our software

657
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:44,270
because they needed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do something so</font>

658
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:47,000
the exam does the software us assist as

659
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:52,550
it comes they executed under they

660
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,050
realize that little big shit then they

661
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,369
tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some they've used it</font>

669
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,140
their sandbox will stay 56 minutes to

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,730
get responses<font color="#E5E5E5"> so once have the response</font>

671
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,950
on that tells you<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for this article</font>

672
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,450
you're bad the rest of the company will

already so everyone is authorized if you

00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:32,029
are lucky enough to have one downloaded

676

which is a bad one well your life is

677
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,830

some policies in place since day one

when a new user joins the company other

there he is profile you need to have

states that no user can if allowed to
