a simplified chart in practice this is

more complex and SMS sea routes that to

85
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,769
all throughout this process information

86
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:14,549
can be compromised because there are

87
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:18,209
errors that ever start could impact any

88
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,858
of these phases so why are less we are

with Mally mal intentions could be just

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,590
several things and information for

instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to G communications in Spain</font>

96
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,349
considering the mobile operators that we

97
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:48,060
have and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are encrypted</font>

98
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:53,300
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a5 algorithm so therefore</font>

99
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:56,840
you can decipher that and II think

100
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:00,930
communication is done through 3g or 4g

101

<font color="#E5E5E5">the frequency</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spectrum is reduced and</font>

104
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:17,219
type of attacks i use a false base so

105
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,770
that we can receive this final of mobile

106
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,600
that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> G or localized for</font>

years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so in any case these attacks</font>

113
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:46,080
forces us to differentiate the attacker

114

from the victim and to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can ask hlr for a</font>

was weak from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning it grew grew</font>

132
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:56,790
and never got stronger so therefore

133
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:00,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is significant for nobility there</font>

134
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,710
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the company offering this</font>

135

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:10,570
consulting it's hella and I'm showing

and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shove it to you so that</font>

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,140
you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anyone can gain access</font>

145
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:43,780
to private information and this is the

146
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:47,710
mobile phone that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consult we</font>

147
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:52,140
have German sim cards because i was

148
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,140
living in germany up until show time ago

149
00:07:52,830 --> 00:08:00,570
and so we I would do it through Python

150
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:15,770
and spending on the type of information

151
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:17,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get we make different</font>

152
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:22,479
consultation so for instance if we want

153
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:26,030
to get the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the m sms sms</font>

154
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:30,530
providing the service<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

155
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:33,319
to use these risks if we want to get MC

156
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:46,670
unique identifier will have to use this

157
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:48,520
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> root in red color well my cell</font>

158
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,579

159
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,079

161
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:11,420
exposed so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it goes MC is</font>

162
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:16,160
there then M is I am this is a unique

163
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:20,750
mobile phone identifier surfaces this

164
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,780
evening you could have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wave force base</font>

165
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,490
station you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be picking up sign off</font>

166
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,490
from mobile phones up until you will

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:31,640
find mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> I recommend you not to do it</font>

168
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,890
because I will switch off my elephant so

169
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,770
that's one option what doesn't wait to

170
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:42,970
do it and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> following</font>

171
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is said you get the name of the MMC</font>

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:53,089
that is providing a service to this

<font color="#E5E5E5">telephone it has a German cars and lots</font>

180
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:30,220
starting to not to liking it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if</font>

you seeing Melissa network because the

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:43,630
class has an agreement with navi stock

185
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,820
and selling me that's the MSC providing

186
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:49,050
the service to me that we identify and

187
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,460
says that this is unique identification

188
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:56,490
so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have different levels of</font>

an MXC that is operating in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Madrid how</font>

203
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:45,310
could launch queries all of the place in

spain mapping all Emma sees that are

205
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:52,119
operational it would be a bit bit too

206
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:54,790
much but we could put together a

207
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,440
database of phone numbers for any

run a complete it I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the</font>

Spain for whatever reason

214
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:16,580
it is relatively easy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go to</font>

the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> estate website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arista</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

samana saying this as pleases my

220
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,660
phone number all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did here was to</font>

221
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:36,459
launch a query on those phone numbers

222
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:39,410
and get the MSC that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would recover</font>

223
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,510
based on that I would put together a map

of all MSC for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain operator</font>

throughout the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> country the main</font>

226
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:52,040
problem here well it could be good or

227
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,839
bad depending on your viewpoint most of

228
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Spanish operators of the largest</font>

229

them gives you the information of the

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,810
mmsc they hide information unlike what

they do in Germany but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wasn't</font>

relatedly recently until last year we

stand for whatever reason would give you

251
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,420
in Catalunya I've tracked my brother

252
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:14,089
I've been playing around with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

259
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:38,628
especially the long ones have solved the

Oliver on Spain use their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own HL arms</font>

288
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:12,079
are like physical operations that

290
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,029
implemented home router so I did some

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,240
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get information from the network</font>

that orange in all cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> or in most</font>

301
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,760
cases they use a 51 well<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sameer uses the</font>

302
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:00,290
same algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a problem because</font>

303
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:03,260
a 51 is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken algorithm labada uses</font>

306
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:16,160
and do Jim use mobile star some of the

307
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:18,709
network they use a 51 as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

308
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,839
a vulnerability that allows attackers to

309
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:26,390
compromise communications over 2g you

310
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,220
can inhibit the spectrum if you want to

311
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,550
make mobile for this operates at to you

312
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,520
on 2g but breaking algorithm a 51 is not

313
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:37,250
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the algorithm work is</font>

314
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,160
not enough you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to know what seed is</font>

315
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,940
being used so to say where do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

316
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,820
I'm so the way you may find out is by

317
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:49,070
comparing a message a coded message with

318
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this with the corresponding non coded</font>

319
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:57,050
message how do you do that well as it

320
00:17:52,250 --> 00:18:00,830
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> in GSM information is sent in</font>

321
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:03,080
frames or in packages some of them have

322
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:05,270
no relevant information under filled

323
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,889
with zeros those packages are sent on a

324
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,320
regular basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in theory you could</font>

325
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture them encode it or none or non</font>

326
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:16,550
encoded and compared to find out what

327
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:19,210
the seed is and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coding all</font>

328
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:22,360
the information

329
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:25,820
that could resolve the problem of

330
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,669
intercepting communications in 2g by

331
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,700
randomizing those frames that have no

332
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:34,850
information with random numbers but none

333
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,470
of them does no operator does that now

334
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,800
physical operation are they operator

335
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:42,950
does that and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a next</font>

337
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem that has to do with relocation</font>

338
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:55,280
MC is a unique identifier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for each phone</font>

339
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:58,670
number and what the regulations say is

340
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,149
that MC cannot be broadcast<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoroughly</font>

341
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,890
in the air or at least not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too often</font>

342
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:07,760
because that will reveal<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process of</font>

343
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:12,230
a certain mobile phone so a temporary MC

344
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,990
is used which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcast in a openly</font>

345
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,630
but if that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not refreshed on a</font>

346
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:20,240
regular basis it stops being temporary

347
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,430
because it becomes a permanent identify

348
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,310
for phone numbers this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what happens</font>

letting someone know whether you're at

388
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:59,418
accuracy but this is so trigger just go

389
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,919
into a URL I think that's terrible

390
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,240
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you can find our other</font>

person in this image they are not

392
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,129
anywhere else<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you want to add a</font>

393
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:11,960
position well you can double the size

394
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:17,480
but you need a much more detailed

395
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,970
knowledge about what to do a number of

396
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:24,740
things that not everyone can do only

397
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:27,889
experts you can achieve arms to give you

398
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,049
an example i tracked my brother I know

399

another he lives in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Granada which is</font>

and northern<font color="#CCCCCC"> New</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else I have a certain</font>

402
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:43,279
piece of information and then I can

403
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:46,970
track him further using the MC and a

404
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:49,669
fake by station to find him with a

410
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:13,019
went so far down into so many details

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:17,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is quite striking how long do you</font>

412

than work but I was interested in this

417
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:36,570
so during the weekends I would probably

418
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,730
launch queries you save my laptop on

419
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,960
random numbers or phone numbers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

420
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,200
would get familiar least by the real
