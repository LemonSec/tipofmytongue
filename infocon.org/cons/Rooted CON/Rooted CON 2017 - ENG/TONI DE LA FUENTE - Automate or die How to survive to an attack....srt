00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,049
those areas but most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us have services</font>

16
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,140
in North Virginia and that was the

<font color="#CCCCCC">reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for our problem the same girls or</font>

19
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,170
they use different terminology they

20
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,539
handle the redundancy in different ways

21
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,480
but when we deploy services using code

22
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,280
we can deploy them in different

23
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,880
geographical areas in a very simple way

24
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,950
in a very quick way therefore the

25
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:58,210
perimeter that we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take into</font>

26
00:07:50,950 --> 00:08:00,190
account when securing everything is not

27
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:04,419
whether we open the door the entire

28
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:12,190
cloud all those things an attacker can

29
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:13,720

32
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,050
is a deployment made by us for managed

33
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,450
services with redundant data bases with

48
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:13,320
telling you all this because we can do

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,860
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a matter of minutes just imagine</font>

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,470
what hardware this<font color="#CCCCCC"> would take months but</font>

anything this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a matter of minutes</font>

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:31,260
literally from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of view of</font>

security both for attacking and

defending this part user scaling group

57
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,399
is very important it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen that at</font>

58
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,950
a certain point in time we have n

59
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,620
servers or<font color="#CCCCCC"> M minus 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers or n plus 1</font>

60
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,930
servers depending if you ask me how many

61
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,899
virtual machines we have operating near

62
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,239
as all cisco I couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you</font>

63
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:53,339
probably 500 600 800 it depends we don't

64
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,430
really know and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

65
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:01,690
important to know if we have the right

66
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">type of controls in place so</font>

67
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:08,440
this is a much larger deployment not

68
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:11,260
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for production this is production</font>

69
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:16,540
development and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth as</font>

70
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:19,660
quick as you see there this deployment

71
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,829
is based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a template is software after</font>

72
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:28,120
all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order to support a certification</font>

73
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:35,380
for credit cards in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case with log</font>

74
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:38,740
on monitoring etc all providers talk

75
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:43,830
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of a shared security</font>

76
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:46,360
model as all<font color="#CCCCCC"> courses with mobility zones</font>

77
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,820
depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of service were</font>

78
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:55,930
using whether we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

79
00:10:48,820 --> 00:11:00,700
computing at two for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's IAS or</font>

80
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:05,020
the database services saas depending on

81
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:07,450
the type of configuration you have so

82
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,069
most providers tell us that they're in

83
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,850
charge they're responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the cloud</font>

84
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,110
and you are responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud</font>

85
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,570
that is important because when we

86
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:20,440
respond to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident we really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

87
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:24,420
know what is our problem and what is the

88
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,610
providers responsibility this is a song

89
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,979
all providers are moving toward

90
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:34,360
something wakeful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> forensics as a</font>

91
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,770
service they try to give you as much

92
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,020
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible so that you</font>

93
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,569
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to contact them although they</font>

94
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,460
always say please contact<font color="#CCCCCC"> us if there is</font>

95
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,540
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem all of those new types of</font>

96
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacks you would like to know about</font>

97
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:54,879
so what challenges complications<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

98
00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:00,699
differences that we have when responding

99
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:02,499
to an incident obviously based on the

100
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:05,229
nature of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> incidents in the cloud I</font>

101
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:07,720
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of tables the bit scary</font>

102
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:14,290
because of their size I will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go one</font>

103
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:17,559
by one particular do this the fact that

104
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:21,029
we may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have infrastructure deployed in</font>

105
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,029
different countries in different regions

106
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,199
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that we really need</font>

107
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take into account in terms of legal</font>

108
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:32,740
jurisdiction and the fact that we have

109
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:36,819
replication of data we may have data

110
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,439
replication in s3 sake bar amazon in

111
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:40,719
different data centers they may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

112
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:43,449
same same region but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can configure it</font>

113
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,959
so that we have different countries that

114
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:49,508
can add complication when<font color="#E5E5E5"> trading things</font>

115
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,209
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the origin and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing where</font>

116
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:54,209
information is at any point

117
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,930
this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really zeros and ones not</font>

118
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,280
purely a digital or technical

119
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,459
information but something we need to

120
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:06,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">take into account and knowledge forty</font>

121
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,770
percent of my time I<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained how</font>

122
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,900
things work to the different developers

123
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:14,230
three different consultants because I

124
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:17,380
say everything we do now developing the

125
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:21,400
infrastructure so a lot of mistakes

126
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:24,400
happen in fact all providers are in a

127
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,640
constant struggle to see who delivers

128
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,040
more services who has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the</font>

129
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,100
more powerful services and they keep

<font color="#E5E5E5">on how you could be attacked I'll talk</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about settlers computing the first thing</font>

137
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,440
developers do is try doing things in a

138
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,750
server less environment until something

139
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:03,190
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's when they call us so</font>

140
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:04,810
we need to preempt those<font color="#CCCCCC"> situations when</font>

doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> PR for insects in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud</font>

142
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,410

143
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,730
differences with conventional forensics

documentation for example the crime

145
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,690
scene documentation obviously you don't

146
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,610
have the documents anything because

147
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,880
there's no crime<font color="#CCCCCC"> scene as such you need</font>

148
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,220
to document the type of infrastructure

149
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,200
or recovering the leader data well it

this is important this is where we can

find data that we need to consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> based</font>

should usually disregarded in the cloud

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:18,740
here at the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say is simera when</font>

unless we say otherwise the storage of

that instance of that virtual machine is

that's it it disappears if I stop the

192
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:36,560

193
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:41,839
that are brought up that way it's like

194
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:45,800
disposable virtual machines I don't need

299
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:40,629
all similar to a piper I don't know

300
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,399
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are aware of this 169 and</font>

301
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:46,090
this gives us information about that

type of information imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

311
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:25,389
exploded and up and we executed a

312
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:28,239
command so if you do that we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

313
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:33,488
information and some to note that

314
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:38,109
metadata server also has keys we get

315
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:40,749
them by making it cool we called we can

316
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:44,049
call the api and if those keys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">concerns do you have poor configuration</font>

330
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:29,200
you can generate 32 our tokens so once

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything you</font>

333
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:41,710
all this this was manual but i'll show

334
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,330
you an automatic attack it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

335
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,570
few seconds we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

336
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">commands cool</font>

337
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:55,939
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> API therefore that can be made</font>

338
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:58,190
automatic so once we are in a machine

339
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">how can I make the most of that</font>

340
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,559
institution escalate privileges the

341
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,470
cloud etc and what else can I do in

342
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:15,139
terms of as other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromising keys</font>

343
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:18,259
etc I can i govern phishing attacks my

344
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:20,779
son often<font color="#CCCCCC"> senses messages and these</font>

345
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:23,179
instance will expire because we will no

346
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:25,820
longer be using the harbor etc and that

347
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:32,059
instance in that is in that hardware and

348
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:35,178
then it senses out in a URL so we've

349
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:39,350
seen phishing attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> F run there there</font>

350
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:44,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">are very many attacks so this one of our</font>

351
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:49,100
poisons am I am I are kind of like I saw

352
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:52,730
that allows you to started seeing you

353
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:59,769
our system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we have also a</font>

354
00:25:52,730 --> 00:26:02,769
marketplace that can be accessed by

355
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:02,769
anyone

356
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:13,630
for bringing I've seen configuration

357
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:19,340
failures and also infection through

358
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:22,310
party services so they have issues of

359
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:25,429
security and to monitor you they need a

360
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:29,300
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of keys and they are only writing</font>

361
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:32,060
keys and I said well it isn't we advise

362
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:35,389
you to rotate to change the keys so

363
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:39,520
hybrid attacks as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move</font>

364
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:42,050
more specifically configuration failures

365
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,260
especially with regard to identity in

366
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:47,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">management's and as I said before there</font>

367
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,600
are new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there all the time</font>

368
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:54,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">for instance server list seven else is</font>

370
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically about functions executing code</font>

390
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,890

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:25,899
we developed applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> to also my</font>

totem<font color="#CCCCCC"> our tiles incident response and</font>

396
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:34,489
this is about stealing keys so either

397
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,889
geha or just entering an instance to

398
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,649
have the keys to configure the keys and

399
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:45,639
then you use a supper which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandbox</font>

400
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:48,229
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> suffered less in Python and then do</font>

401
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:50,748
take it from there the attack on account

402
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,990
you make lateral movement to generally

403
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:56,210
they had persistence etc and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

404
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,700
ending up to destroying the full

406
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,470
were to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would not be the</font>

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">some companies had to tell under</font>

companies because some<font color="#E5E5E5"> punish the keys</font>

410
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:13,779
and the keys were has lots of privileges

411
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:26,918
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you to see how fast you</font>

412
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:30,440
can make an attack so we are deploying

413
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">zappa this is a valence amazon service</font>

414
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:39,049
can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> read it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a few seconds</font>

415
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,220
depending on your internet connection

416
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:45,980
and then it generates roll with the name

417
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,999
trolley will trick you it will generate

418
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:52,909
a nappy ABI gateway it's a new thing of

419
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:55,129
amazon amazon and it has no security

420
00:29:52,909 --> 00:30:01,909
groups it controls no ports it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

421
00:29:55,129 --> 00:30:06,949
generates a website well that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

422
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to and you can sit off instances</font>

423
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:14,899
generate new instances security groups

424
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:19,509
etc etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very very</font>

425
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:19,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">careful with what we publish</font>

426
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,550
sorry this is the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> video give me a</font>

427
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:31,080
sec we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very careful with his</font>

428
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:36,659
security office<font color="#E5E5E5"> our accounts and as I</font>

429
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:41,120
say attacks are automated and this is

430
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,120
the case we can also automate defense

431
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:49,800
another attack wall very interesting

432
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:54,860
tool kids actually same author than

433
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:58,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sabah if you are very interested in this</font>

434
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:04,409
well you have you must see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:59,580
am i doing with time good ok so now

450
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:00,980
incident response how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we are in the cloud</font>

452
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:07,020
sometimes we've seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in through</font>

sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy we population is proper</font>

455
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:17,280
we can see the users are having that

00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:23,240
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> logged on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also i mentioned to</font>

457

some of you but sometimes we see an

00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,920
invoice for a high amount of money and

459
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,100
this tells you that something has gone

460
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:36,140
wrong

461
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:41,389

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,809
you make contacts amazon supports and

468
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:59,029
they will not judge you for that or they

469
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:02,000
give you your money back because they

470
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:05,090
also fight him very hard to stop that at

471
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,029
the end of the day clouds of providers

472
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:11,240
are selling the liability so that we all

473
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:14,120
move to the cloud then also logs and

474
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">other also through third-party tools i'm</font>

479
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,870
applicable in the cloud because it's not

480
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">only about looking into the your network</font>

or your instance you have to look above

482
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:40,399
that because at the end of the day we're

487
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:57,020
for several reasons that we may discuss

cm is not one hundred percent applicable

incidents when i saw the first incident

497
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,609
i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok but i'll have to do</font>

we automated sewing amazon opening a

<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that with the script and</font>

things that are done differently for

507
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:03,230
instance obtaining information about

508
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:05,270
around our instances and send you about

509
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,839
instances but we are not not only

510
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:12,589
instances also virtual day machines your

many services and we have to get all

00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:33,740
those data isolated the machines etc I

514
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:36,770
know this is added to information about

515
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:39,078
the infrastructure so here we'll have

516
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">these systems gathering information and</font>

517

all the API traffic that is generated in

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,939
these accounts and often it is

<font color="#CCCCCC">configured in one region or in multiple</font>

regions often this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not so enable and</font>

521
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,400
we have to enable it if we receive a

522
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:59,029
good attack with lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> preventive</font>

526
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,509
therefore your control system will not

<font color="#CCCCCC">be triggered but when you go and see</font>

528
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:15,289
what happens on your API to kind of see

529

anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is encrypted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and to</font>

also be register this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing enabled</font>

we have to enable it manually<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as I</font>

535
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:47,970
said some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> tasks can be</font>

00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:51,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">automated and they are automatic now</font>

537
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:54,359
and they last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote enough an</font>

00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:10,590
analysis with fitting tools how to do

541
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the cloud that's what I</font>

542
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:18,300
published and then in August twenty

543
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:20,970
sixteen people from set response now

544
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,700
collaborating with them they presented

545
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:27,000
it soon in black hands it is an alpha

546
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:29,250
it's missing a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> features but i</font>

547
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,369
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future does the way to go</font>

548
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:36,030
it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to found a number of tasks</font>

549
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:38,910
that will be long in time it allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

550
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,830
to automate them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to natural enough</font>

551
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,569
for one instance but for multiple

552
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:45,240
instance and it also allows us to gather

553
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:48,840
information from old services from all

554
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,729
services to be later analyzed so there

555
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,220
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of commands and the scripts</font>

556
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:56,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that and now I'd like</font>

crawlers looking for keys on the

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,140
internet and often amazon let me know

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that quite fast and then</font>

568

we have automated<font color="#E5E5E5"> the following do</font>

00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:47,280
tools that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have from providers I very</font>

724
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:50,670
much like openness<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut it has a fixed</font>

725
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:54,240
option it may generate and script to

726
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:56,640
make an automatic hardening so it

727
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,399
generates<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scripts for you and the</font>

728
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,950
Prowler this is a tool that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

729
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,250
developed you know linux everyone knows

730
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:09,390
linux for linux it is a linux full

731
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:11,520
amazon and it is based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Seas CIF</font>

732
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:14,460
benchmark<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will show you right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">execute the script and the fakes of</font>

photograph of you security we did it

735
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,030
because we wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this data</font>

736
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">first letters of each of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these accounts</font>

737
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,690
and then to see which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the final</font>

738
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,000
result after the hardening<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will also</font>

739
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">be shall we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do security monkey which is</font>

740
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,210
a wonderful tool which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

741
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,280
especially when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

742
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:34,380
accounts in amazon so for that what is

743
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening I very much liked it because i</font>

744
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,030
know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see what everyone is</font>

745
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,610
doing at every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> time especially</font>

746
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:44,760
when they are making sailors with

747
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:48,240
sometimes they are and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not least</font>

748
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:51,570
doing things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not right and as I</font>

749
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,060
say very many tools and some of them

750
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful as you can see there</font>

751
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,680
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many more tools for Amazon because</font>

752
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:03,600
I'm as earnings older than other

753
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:08,370
providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> but everyone is aware of</font>

Netflix not only known<font color="#CCCCCC"> for its serious</font>

755
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:13,830
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they also have a security department</font>

756
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:16,890
and develop what I develop and lots of

757
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:19,740
tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they published security</font>

758
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:23,730
monkey ada feed oh very interesting

759
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:27,830
tools and as an overall hardening i

760
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:27,830
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> get secrets</font>

761
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:37,380
these are hooks providing a preventing

studies for deploying code often this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

766
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:17,640
done through template through Jason and

767
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:20,549
Jamal Jamal I have templates this is

768
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:24,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the sea is generated by amazon</font>

services controls ultimate detection of

771
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:35,789
several attacks you do that only by

772
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:37,828
deploying template it is automatic you

773
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:40,200
don't have to do anything manually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

774
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:45,119
recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to do it for all your</font>

775
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:47,788
accounts it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available after a</font>

776
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:51,869
few minutes now in few minutes so also

777
00:51:47,789 --> 00:51:55,250
different lambda functions to optimate

778
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:55,250
all these security controls

779
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:05,609
so the tool that will have generated for

780
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:17,430
the assessments of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a becomes</font>

781
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:19,799
is known as Prowler it right through

782
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:23,328
different points identity management so

783
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:27,660
more critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> users less critical users</font>

784
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:34,309
those with password policies welcome

785
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:37,288
figures and not as good well whether

786
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:41,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">gartrell is enabled for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the regions</font>

787

or not so when I talk about only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">region but all amazon regions so as I</font>

789
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:57,180
said this gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a number of view</font>

790
00:52:47,579 --> 00:53:01,609
about my security this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of my</font>

791
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,609
favorite tools which is acutely monkey

792
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:13,019
as i say security monkey makes the query

793
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:15,959
through everything in the Amazon API and

794
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:17,399
never<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50-minute e makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a diff and if</font>

795
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:20,549
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are changes it's actually about</font>

796
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:23,269
the changes and has a number of controls

797
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:27,059
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the changes controls about</font>

798
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:29,578
changes relating to security services

799
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:33,989
security group is open and alert is

800
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:36,749
triggered and arranged by level of

801
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:39,349
severity so you can make comments about

802
00:53:36,749 --> 00:53:39,348
the salad

803
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:48,580
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showing you one accounts</font>

804
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:51,020
but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have 20 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 accounts</font>

805
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:53,750
which is often the case in large

806
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:55,790
corporations it is very highly

807
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:58,880
complicated to access all those accounts

808
00:53:55,790 --> 00:54:03,290
and see what happens but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

809
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:07,910
the accounts<font color="#E5E5E5"> indexed by severity danger</font>

810
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:09,529
level so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a point of view that</font>

811
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:12,980
is quite wide about everything that is

812
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:16,270
happening policies that may well

813
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:23,960
may-maybe incorrectly configured roles

814
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:30,620
so you have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all here and with that</font>

815
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:35,650
i'm almost done as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a</font>

816
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:38,200
connection i'll upload everything here

817
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:40,790
in fact everything is based on a

818
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,189
template you have all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> commands and</font>

819
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:44,870
you can replicate so as a summary

820
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:47,420
automation for everything including

821
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:49,790
hardening everything is possible in

822
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:57,380
terms of automation encrypt everywhere

823
00:54:49,790 --> 00:55:02,210
with your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys separate accounts use</font>

developers who know nothing about

826
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:12,370
infrastructures and then buy bitcoins

827
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:12,370
just in case questions

828
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:27,579
the same egg magalona did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go beyond</font>

829
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:29,500
the time questions please stand up

830
00:55:27,579 --> 00:55:31,900
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no way within see your</font>

faces<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll jump the queue myself</font>

832
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:36,970
would you like to deliver this talk on

833
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:38,769
as all talking about internals because

834
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:43,750
Microsoft is sponsoring and we have

835
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:46,000
exile here we can talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him you do</font>

836
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:49,240
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in parallel something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool yes</font>

837
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:54,579
I could try I could give it a go I would

838
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:56,229
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> match the elements from one</font>

839
00:55:54,579 --> 00:55:58,990
platform to the other in fact I had a

840
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:01,170
chat with Deanna about this yes

841
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,169
absolutely

842
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:13,038
don't go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the break because we will</font>

843
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:16,160
use a few minutes to tell you about

844
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:25,700
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> so please remain here any more</font>

845
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:27,920
questions any disasters you have come

846
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:30,169
across yourself directly apart from

847
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:35,829
companies going<font color="#E5E5E5"> bust someone that has</font>

848
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:40,089
been impacted in a big way well a

849
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:40,089
department I will not mention any names

850
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:46,669
publish the keys generating instances

851
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,650
without noticing what they were doing we

852
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:56,210
got the money back from amazon by the

853
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:59,960
way we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an account let's call it the</font>

854
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:03,410
out-of-control account and there's been

855
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:06,559
quite a few shocks was that account we

856
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:08,899
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a role where I only allow</font>

857
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:12,619
people to deploy infrastructure in

00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:15,890
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Regents and we some reduce the</font>

861
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:23,259
be a disaster because they set up things

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Singapore and it's just don't notice</font>
