1
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,840
who would like to thank you for coming

2
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:10,130
after lunch you know this can be a

3
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,410
tricky slot or seus novel back home but

4
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:18,820
we'll try to make it entertaining Terry

5
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:20,600
said demo part and the software part is

6
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,250
pre-recorded so I'm gonna type in a

7
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,589
problem here we didn't come here alone

8
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:31,000
are now and of myself

9
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:36,560
this is our program for today we will

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,720
you what the hacking talking who wasn't

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,420
here last year we will explain the

12
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,960
concept harbour and software concept and

13
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:47,390
how we have materialized things but

14
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,149
we're not here alone but we come with

15
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,770
more people a couple of Association the

16
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:54,710
University of Barcelona I want to take

17
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,110
this opportunity to introduce us for

18
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,119
whoever doesn't know us this is our

19
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,820
first route I am up now I am 20 years

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,500
old and I study mathematics and Computer

21
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,380
Engineering at the University of

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,840
Barcelona and I participated in delay in

23
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,699
several security conferences in the last

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,080
three or four years and in the

25
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,950
Association I've worked and here is

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,280
hacking URI which is new from the end of

27
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:22,339
2016 with about ourselves to social

28
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,030
issues and security in computer security

29
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:29,090
we've organised workshops about things

30
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:32,900
like Internet of Things etc I come from

31
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:37,100
an association called physics ronica was

32
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:40,970
founded many years ago I have a few free

33
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,670
kids who like to play with these tools

34
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,890
and then some of us moved on to

35
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:50,500
electronics as well in the two degrees

36
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,500
and computer security is

37
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,569
is where I been worsted when I got in

38
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,040
touch with their stocking and we met in

39
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,488
that environment and we wanted to do

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,429
something together in last year we heard

41
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:07,859
this wonderful talk from given my all

42
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,870
sweet tools of mine where he explains

43
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:14,430
many things he talked about different

44
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:16,019
topics but the main threat was about

45
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,849
hacking tools

46
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:23,629
they talked about software a lot and he

47
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:26,459
presented him and he showed of you

48
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:32,159
slides about hacking tokens

49
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:36,120
and he defined them as device with go

50
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,280
who to to compromise with the

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,680
combination of software and hardware and

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:47,299
to have something that was accessible

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:51,239
with very little footprint discrete and

54
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:54,079
and we started looking for candidates

55
00:03:51,239 --> 00:04:02,220
where we thought we could pick up a

56
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:06,120
daily object or power feeding and

57
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:11,040
something that is not noticeable or and

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,079
that we could give a person to and from

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,320
the part of an electronic engineer and

60
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:19,079
having thought about it for a while with

61
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,590
her about a battery chargers and drones

62
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:28,080
or a thermostat whatever but in the end

63
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:30,560
our conclusion was to try it out with

64
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,940
the power bank because it's becoming a

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:39,389
quite ubiquitous because people tend to

66
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:44,360
to get one of those at home so the

67
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:47,849
victim will actually manage the

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,449
electronic the power in of the device

69
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:54,419
and we felt that it was made at

70
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,400
reference to was one of the few things

71
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,049
that had not been here a nice yet and

72
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,679
that

73
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:05,840
why not to do it without including if

74
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,639
you would somebody I give you as a

75
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,530
present the power bank and then we can

76
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:18,379
do things with that so now I'm going to

77
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:20,568
show you a few slides software that

78
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:24,860
there now will tell you about it so what

79
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:28,250
do we want to reverse the power bank we

80
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,960
have to go down and if you take a power

81
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:36,440
bank that you have at home that doesn't

82
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:38,359
work anymore and you open it up because

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,930
some of them are not so easy to open

84
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:49,280
this is what you'll find this is the one

85
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:51,229
with the single cell the power cell for

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:56,929
this type of batteries like in mobile

87
00:05:51,229 --> 00:06:02,120
phones and you find a cell circuit here

88
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:06,259
with several parts as explaining this

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,860
the slide there's a lot of electronics

90
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:13,610
but if you want to simplify from this

91
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,460
type of battery if you start from the

92
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,009
right this type of batteries are

93
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:24,099
batteries that do not have a constant

94
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:27,259
self downloading in terms of voltage

95
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,479
none of them are constant in that sense

96
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:32,419
but in this case that's particularly

97
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,750
serious and they you can go from a three

98
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,799
point six to four point two volts

99
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,870
although nominally they're always in

100
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,000
three point seven and this is a mess

101
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,400
because the problem of these batteries

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,400
is not that but the fact that in order

103
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,120
to know them of and to prevent them from

104
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,810
exploding you have to know them with the

105
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,750
same this charging curve with a special

106
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:59,630
controller so that it is charged at the

107
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:02,180
same attention and that's how you

108
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:06,440
explain this load in circuit and the

109
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,780
protection circuit is to prevent over

110
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,060
this charging

111
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:14,799
in the battery and what the protection

112
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:17,370
circuit does is to separate the end of

113
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,770
the battery when those things come up

114
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:25,570
this bad circuit is not simple we could

115
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:27,909
spend hours in in power electronics but

116
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,270
you can have to accept that it it picks

117
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:34,230
up any tension below five and it takes

118
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:38,469
us to five volts

119
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:42,760
they have two amperes that depend on the

120
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:45,010
input level with a bit of a large but it

121
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,700
allows us to charge a mobile phone which

122
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:50,409
is what they do this is a detail the

123
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,360
list of components I'm not going to go

124
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,720
into detail but you can look at it

125
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,080
afterwards to pick up the components to

126
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:04,120
go to Google and look in more detail you

127
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:06,099
can do so any question before we go into

128
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,180
it fully into it the software people are

129
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:13,030
going to they're going to say I want to

130
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,800
have a Wi-Fi here what can we do in the

131
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,950
big question is we're going to have a

132
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,890
microcontroller and we're going to need

133
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,530
a Wi-Fi output or something of this sort

134
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,360
so the state of the art there there's

135
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,559
there are plenty of things I guess

136
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,140
you'll be familiar with some of this

137
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:38,169
cart and the whole ecosystem I've had

138
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:40,120
I've included a variety as you can see

139
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,699
it takes us instruments an American

140
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,700
company that has a lot of material and

141
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,130
the cards are very very reasonably

142
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,660
priced and in the end we decided to stay

143
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:55,470
with quite standard which is an Arduino

144
00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:00,760
with it's a micro controller and we

145
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:04,040
develop and card this is a Arduino micro

146
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:16,210
Leonardo or Explorer

147
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:19,010
and it's a 32 q 4 and the MCU v3 esp8266

148
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,560
and we've chosen because it's present

149
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:24,610
indeed in in different places that I can

150
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:33,530
work with 5 volts and 3.3 volts and

151
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:35,870
logic and it implements the USB stack

152
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,470
which is in that sense it's different

153
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:43,000
and better than many micro trips where

154
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:45,470
you have to implement a USB translators

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,870
serial USB translator so that you can

156
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:52,940
program it and to access it that's one

157
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,510
thing that we can discuss and the node M

158
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,430
C u v3 we've chosen it because it

159
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:06,770
becoming famous it's quite well-known

160
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:08,800
because it has Wi-Fi Wi-Fi area and it

161
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:13,250
gives us that access that we would need

162
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,810
in this sense this is not a single

163
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,640
solution you can find solutions in

164
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,439
Internet what they implement partial

165
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,710
solutions for instance that they can s

166
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:26,060
be and put very smoothly for battery to

167
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:29,360
do some attacks or exercises of a few

168
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,089
hours in our band or you can find

169
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,130
another partial solution which is the

170
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,900
deck there should be and connected to

171
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,900
the Leonardo either we know and the

172
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:46,520
diagram is a solution like any other one

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,890
and we've chosen this one because it can

174
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,350
go to three point three so we can go

175
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:55,250
from three point six to three point two

176
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:57,560
three but that we know will recharge at

177
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:02,330
five also will try to put it in parallel

178
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:05,209
post in parallel to any mobile or any

179
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,980
other charging device there's a reason

180
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,270
for this we can also have a sensor in

181
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,990
the battery to get more information

182
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:13,040
about what's going on

183
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:16,910
and this is a simplified machine

184
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,709
although it's only looking at the

185
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:22,050
charging source this is also a very

186
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:23,760
simplified circuit of how the data are

187
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,859
going and how the communication is

188
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,740
happening and we can use both a microUSB

189
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,490
of the power bank and to get information

190
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,440
and connect to the microcontrollers and

191
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:41,760
we could also eventually do

192
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:43,770
communication between them I to see type

193
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:52,560
for instance so I'm going to move on to

194
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:54,630
the harbour so in this regard about 10

195
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,560
minutes to make sure that everything

196
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:01,439
makes sense to show that we are can

197
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,430
actually charge a mobile device or two

198
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:10,339
different things I know that you can see

199
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,339
it well here give you the Assemble

200
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,420
Powerbank you find this

201
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,839
he's a circuit I was talking about

202
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:25,029
earlier there isn't much more to say

203
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:30,609
everything and he was a battery the

204
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:33,519
battery he's a commercial battery can be

205
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:37,899
found on the market and here we have a

206
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:40,480
similar battery including some charging

207
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:42,999
protection circuits so I bought a few of

208
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,279
these batteries and we began to move

209
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:52,649
them home another thing you needed to

210
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:52,649
acquire he's a circuit separate

211
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,440
okay

212
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:10,450
so here you can see this and if you have

213
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:12,720
our dance letters now this is signed for

214
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,940
the power bank and these can be acquired

215
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,890
separately in two parts the microUSB

216
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,560
with the charging circuit and the

217
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,600
battery possession on the back is one of

218
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,750
the components or having little earlier

219
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,460
you may also acquire the step up there

220
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:31,990
is charging circuit which is very small

221
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:34,060
here you have the coil and condenser and

222
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,910
the rest of the step on circuit in this

223
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:47,079
example of his power bank so you have

224
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:52,449
these two components but here are welded

225
00:13:47,080 --> 00:14:00,130
one of these this one goes here and now

226
00:13:52,450 --> 00:14:07,210
I just need a battery ready not even a

227
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:10,230
little one I don't you know that the

228
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,230
light will work but

229
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,140
nice I hope you okay

230
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:47,910
Jesse seem you ever hold up okay so now

231
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:51,360
I think you've working we need to charge

232
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:56,819
the battery it's a pretty start of

233
00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:00,260
charger for raspberry P can you actually

234
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,260
see the rabbit

235
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,700
and here's a charging circuit attacks

236
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,189
there's a battery charges it with the

237
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,020
red LED he shows that it is charging if

238
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:17,890
you disconnect it you should see the

239
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:20,350
blue LED and you can see the red one the

240
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,900
red one is he long he shows a different

241
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:27,100
sizes which means that I don't find the

242
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:30,610
battery so the battery was fully charged

243
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,880
I will have I will see the blue one this

244
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:37,570
is something that we know that is tunnel

245
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:40,870
and now we want you to see these jumps a

246
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:43,810
kit you may see here there is a rattler

247
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:46,930
it song so you're actually getting power

248
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:52,229
from the battery there's three point six

249
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,229
or 3.7 volts and getting down

250
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:04,019
if I take out the microUSB connector

251
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,940
straight to the power the secret seal

252
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,180
discharges battery so we have a power

253
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,180
bank

254
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,750
let's see where they can fit everything

255
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,750
here

256
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:31,229
as you know the USB 4 dimensions and is

257
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:31,229
now charging

258
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:41,449
so gosh you're charging our mobile phone

259
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:46,750
from the battery there's a usual power

260
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,750
bank the question is can we do this

261
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,980
replacing these USB input by whatever we

262
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,920
want

263
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,920
let's check so here we have the USB

264
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:09,209
and this board model this MCU model has

265
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,209
two interesting things

266
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:18,189
we recommend this model in particular

267
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:21,609
because it has two diodes I know that

268
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:23,650
you can see see the pair these two is

269
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:26,859
more components or two security diodes

270
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:29,260
the liars allow us to connect a battery

271
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,840
at the same time of the USB directly for

272
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,750
it to load so that nothing burns right

273
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:40,709
now the battery is charging and

274
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:45,120
discharging at the same time so that the

275
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:48,750
MCU no lee seong in fact if we want to

276
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,750
mobile demo now

277
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:07,880
so should have connected a si PAP if you

278
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:11,920
want to connect password is the one that

279
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,920
we had in the RV in this example

280
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,860
but if you go to the navigator when they

281
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:22,010
drop to the ground and all of us were

282
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,889
scientists as we can active today as

283
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,570
being that it's working

284
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:29,510
so now we have the proof of concept that

285
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:34,429
it really works to place a SPE in the

286
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:36,590
middle of a power bank and we can start

287
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:43,040
doing things and if at home you want to

288
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:46,090
work on it you can set up a more

289
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,090
sophisticated board

290
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:57,800
and we Versace this angle PCB had a

291
00:18:52,050 --> 00:19:02,879
limited time so here is a hardware part

292
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,620
like to recover this after the part of

293
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,070
your some of the attacks and our now

294
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,330
we'll talk about software so regarding

295
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,090
software the first thing that we need to

296
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,580
wonder is so we've set all this up we've

297
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,320
got a device that has power that it's

298
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:21,149
portable the house my father has

299
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:23,760
microcontroller and to tackle these

300
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:26,060
which other basic needs that we have and

301
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,440
he would think about four essential bits

302
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:34,560
which are to be able to reprogram this

303
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:38,130
hardware obviously because it was just

304
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:42,659
for one problem the fan will be lost we

305
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:45,840
can so later we want to retrieve the

306
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,790
item I should be able to be sold in turn

307
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,560
we want to be able to recover these a

308
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:53,820
turn on yesterday and they said local

309
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,409
but we have access to them and he will

310
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,990
also be interesting just like he's my

311
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,820
home shove the model design of the

312
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,050
hardware the software should be as

313
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:07,889
modular pluggable as possible

314
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,169
without changing a being a breathable

315
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,840
block we should be able to put our bases

316
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,520
uh-huh

317
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:19,409
so he will get to a general idea for

318
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:22,200
design of an attack with a device that

319
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:25,470
has a Wi-Fi connection and this is an

320
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:30,240
abstract machine we have the ILS age

321
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:33,000
divine loop we have the different

322
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,940
attacks as well you can see up there

323
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,770
there are like home states they could be

324
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,940
plugging it's not depending from the

325
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,700
rest and in turn we have another sytrus

326
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:48,840
the deals with recovering kind of sorry

327
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:51,290
data we have the after date of the final

328
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:56,340
machine we'll make it more particular

329
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:59,700
right here which is a basic proof of

330
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:03,449
concept so we have the idle state now

331
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:07,070
you may see here the loop has two parts

332
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,070
we have microcontroller

333
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:15,379
so the loop would change between the

334
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:19,010
initial status which is kawaii files

335
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:21,890
which is kind of random in communicating

336
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:25,120
with microcontroller to eventually be

337
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:29,330
able to do things with it and talk to it

338
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:33,560
let's see it's for later then we'll come

339
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:36,790
until a captive portal sounds and then

340
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:39,200
we have another sages that deals with

341
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:44,350
capturing that data so let's talk about

342
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,350
the loop sages which is Wi-Fi scan

343
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,179
some just mentioned that look the status

344
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,730
is random it could be always at an

345
00:21:53,179 --> 00:22:01,940
access point mode so they're talking

346
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,100
with his sign he's a power bank it may

347
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:07,130
be moved and may have access of

348
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,830
different Wi-Fi networks that may scan

349
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:13,220
so it made much more sense be able to

350
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:15,889
scan Wi-Fi in its loop it's every night

351
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,259
Oakland with a long-term something fixed

352
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:19,549
it's done Wi-Fi there would make sense

353
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:23,330
because we would always have the same

354
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:25,070
thing so it was more interesting to have

355
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,949
this here we have the power bank which

356
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,539
you can move around so it's coming with

357
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,820
Wi-Fi here gives us much more

358
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:35,990
information and we have a few basic

359
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:40,509
things here the token nice worked as a

360
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:43,220
Wi-Fi plan client in his come his guns

361
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:47,179
available Wi-Fi so changing keeps the

362
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:50,299
name the mark a signals we have more

363
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,980
feel that we could so but I think we

364
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:54,139
think these are enough for the proofs of

365
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,779
concept we've done and you saw this

366
00:22:54,139 --> 00:23:01,610
later I don't know whether you've worked

367
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:06,440
with SSDs you might know as base which

368
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:08,549
is a standard storage system used by the

369
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,950
ESPYs

370
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:13,589
these parts are restored on the same

371
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:17,009
flash memory as problem spell you can

372
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:19,589
actually it's so that prolong without

373
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:21,299
you it in the files bound so here's how

374
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:24,559
here's how it works

375
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:27,209
it's very City used because it's modes

376
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,759
for files and writing are sent one as

377
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:31,169
they see opened you see they work in the

378
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,869
same way they have some limitations

379
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:35,580
though after we found that we have

380
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:38,158
microcontroller is limited

381
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,820
he has eighty case of run and four

382
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,499
megabytes of flash is very limited that

383
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,089
means that the file system that we can

384
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:49,139
set up is also quite limited

385
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:52,469
here's a layout of the LSB of the

386
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:55,519
function in this URL you might check all

387
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:57,919
the documents on nez perce

388
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:02,459
you may see there is a space for

389
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:05,339
sketches now the OJT file system the

390
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:06,809
Wi-Fi configuration here on these links

391
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:08,969
you have all these information quite

392
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:10,950
works buttons so next we're going to

393
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:13,409
talk about the attack of the talkative

394
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,179
portal you run this attack on the

395
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:19,799
network of the person or university

396
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:22,109
without permission and here in the

397
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:25,070
former case the token need to be in

398
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:25,070
artist punk man

399
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:29,829
simulating the support of the car

400
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:33,569
captive of a open Wi-Fi got the

401
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:38,799
University do this at dark we use the

402
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:40,569
space to recall those HTML files we

403
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,668
produce the countif portal and you know

404
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:45,609
that is mined does anyone not know what

405
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:48,459
a captive portal is well when you go to

406
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:50,708
a hotel or public Wi-Fi they're like

407
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:52,599
okay you need to log in to continue so

408
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:55,149
you give you a mail over of credentials

409
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:58,269
and you can continue with the

410
00:24:55,149 --> 00:25:02,289
connections so one our file simulate

411
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:04,329
these captive portal how do we make it

412
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:07,959
to work with active portal you may make

413
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:13,059
a request he takes back to the captive

414
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:14,859
portal and the browser should say well

415
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:19,119
you need to read well to continue it's a

416
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:22,239
transplant as possible and as a normal

417
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:25,658
expected behavior whoever here would he

418
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:30,089
need a DNS server and he does a very

419
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:34,869
simple explanation of how it works

420
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:37,940
as we said we'll configure the access

421
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:45,409
point that way

422
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:48,110
we find it randomly so we initiate the

423
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:52,940
DNS server so that our requests are sent

424
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:55,820
to the Gateway HDB so to hundreds you

425
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,890
can go to the Gateway DP if you have

426
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:02,179
that may be useful and if you don't find

427
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:06,320
it if he doesn't find what to tell you I

428
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:10,510
say okay go through the Gateway to so

429
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:14,960
here's how I was keen it's okay worries

430
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:18,590
any given the main he'd also reply is on

431
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,050
these IP which is the gateway IP for our

432
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,850
fake active portal and we have an

433
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:26,470
advantage here for the implementation of

434
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,469
user experience

435
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:34,140
browsers and the mining operating

436
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,850
systems and they detect the requests are

437
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,610
being required to be same IP they say

438
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:41,250
okay this is an active portal and I give

439
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:44,010
you pop-up of logging in here they don't

440
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:49,530
mind what a thesis is coded they see

441
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:51,060
this message this is open in certain

442
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:54,300
windows theory you don't go to your

443
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,530
browser directly open internal window if

444
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,320
it's quite transparent you don't know

445
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:01,500
really where you're browsing around so

446
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,350
we have that advantage and I'd like to

447
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:09,180
quickly explain how we get data out of

448
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:12,600
here he would need to be neither Hawking

449
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,760
token to be in client mode and here the

450
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,459
Hawking token the way we've implemented

451
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,330
whenever he does a look at the why first

452
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:23,790
bounce defeat collapse until right piece

453
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,990
you will connect you Sunday install file

454
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,889
and you will empty out the log file

455
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:33,750
because you have some immediate memory

456
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:36,420
to do this we need an external server so

457
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:41,330
we have server he has a few things about

458
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,330
it it's a very simple server based

459
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:50,220
Python with Bayes HTTP request unlearn

460
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:54,420
in our say SSL Certificates of traffic

461
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:58,170
is his colleague from the sp2 server

462
00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:00,570
he has unique ID 75 the token service

463
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,389
may have given out

464
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:11,070
others are our tourist attractions which

465
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:14,849
are stored securely to finish this will

466
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:17,899
be along uploaded to the gift hub dog

467
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:17,899
hugging toe goodness

468
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:28,149
what we have assigned to some other

469
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:33,820
software is the mio platform the

470
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:36,699
platform iio is the valve up struck so

471
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:41,109
you haven't taught about blocker but I'm

472
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:43,899
sure you know it same platform i/o we

473
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:45,399
manage much better libraries were able

474
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:48,488
to interact with several components the

475
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:51,129
same time also the debugging is not

476
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:56,830
remotely and visa cop system is quite

477
00:28:51,129 --> 00:29:02,049
nice he has a clique part the different

478
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:04,029
IDs and here the item and agency Syria

479
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:06,789
but it may also be seen it's annoying

480
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:09,879
and others so please do look at platform

481
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:11,919
oh yeah if you don't know it because

482
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:13,748
it's quite interesting for this and

483
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,539
that's when I look at the results of

484
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:20,169
these attacks

485
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:27,290
the first one is talked about the evil

486
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:30,260
tree hotel is effective portal attack

487
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:32,899
on the university of barcelona and it's

488
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,060
able to capture those credentials or

489
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:38,570
have been said to initiate the session

490
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:41,210
of me on this captive portal so we have

491
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,860
installed in the real user data and the

492
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,600
passwords even though the university

493
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,780
gave us permission for two tests I

494
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:54,439
really think this was appropriate the

495
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:56,420
passwords are not a sword the most my

496
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,820
very ephemeral fair laughing already

497
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,790
through these life but even as I should

498
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,260
tell as well try not to do life or

499
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,820
connect an access point to the internet

500
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,090
because some things have happened so

501
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,620
you're curious to make sure that it

502
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:17,449
really works we can show it to you later

503
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:18,580
but a bit of our service is not bad

504
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,830
actually

505
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:23,750
so you have the Wi-Fi is the captive a

506
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,139
Marxist point he allows us to do the

507
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,140
login

508
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:35,259
put our user name and this is the cart

509
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:41,970
if both of them literally have opened up

510
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:45,809
page which is connectivity check just

511
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,809
tarting come

512
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:55,920
it is okay the bus will failed so most

513
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:57,330
Internet networks for universities fails

514
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,640
of these not a surprise

515
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,040
I'm father of the times you connect they

516
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,760
don't work so they kind of play with

517
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:13,680
that balance so these will be sold on

518
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:15,840
the SP will be centered server okay kind

519
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:21,630
of kind of loss assume but here we are

520
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,100
again so what is the source get some

521
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,400
form what is the username and the

522
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:29,310
password is just captures a pattern note

523
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,120
of what has being entered here are the

524
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:36,060
changes in the status machine here we

525
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,020
have the small Jason for monthly sent

526
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,639
out to the server time summaries that

527
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,629
could be useful to about talking and get

528
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,630
the hours and other things

529
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:51,669
and then the second result is okay so we

530
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:54,610
have an animal that has powers who Tommy

531
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:57,460
once he gets Wi-Fi you saw them

532
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:00,100
sends them out to a server so what can

533
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:04,299
we do with things so we can actually

534
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:07,178
locate can do the location from victim

535
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:10,480
directly via Wi-Fi data that are being

536
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:14,919
collected I meant a like a Google has a

537
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,159
PR has an API to do this directly we

538
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:21,610
just got the date about the name the

539
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,919
mark and the power or the intensity of

540
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:28,090
the signal and that's enough and you're

541
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:30,159
gonna see some examples of routes that

542
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:39,789
we have been able to track let's see the

543
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:41,230
video first so we have a video first so

544
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:47,080
you're gonna see how we have date on the

545
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:50,260
server is a real logging these are time

546
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,178
sounds logging with all the the items

547
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,990
becomes the occasion things regarding

548
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,990
the Wi-Fi haters

549
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:03,009
so this file has been transferred

550
00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:05,259
locally yeah you could restore it

551
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:08,789
think a little server here we have a

552
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:12,549
little script in Python checks the

553
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:15,970
Google API and here we can generate maps

554
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:20,019
here's a map of the taxi that goes from

555
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:22,869
the torture its and rotation in Madrid

556
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:25,929
and this is a path that has a straight

557
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:27,789
line on Granby in Barcelona and is a

558
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:31,389
couple of bosses from the Barcelona

559
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:34,859
University if you remember the image is

560
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:34,859
likely the first one this one

561
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:46,199
is what we can do Kate by using ours can

562
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:48,809
animals and beasts the route suggested

563
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:51,059
from my Google Maps ago from her

564
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:55,168
tortured realization to to here to kill

565
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:58,079
a police and you may hit proceed here

566
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:59,579
but there's an area around here this big

567
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,859
here we haven't done it these were

568
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,809
tunnels by the way they went through a

569
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:07,228
couple of tunnels that were Wi-Fi was

570
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:13,980
not detected so did a straight line from

571
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:16,079
here to here crashed but all the rest I

572
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,980
think these passive extrema and none of

573
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,679
these has been done so a taxi driver

574
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:28,250
with mops and said okay I want to get

575
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,250
the any key to that route the Barcelona

576
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,489
tom is purchasing university was lorna

577
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:40,960
will go up here and we do a transfer he

578
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:45,250
goes out he's like literally I know the

579
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:48,340
you've seen the video in such a geek

580
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,679
inside another seminary got his crash to

581
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,900
perfection went to Locker we came back

582
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,110
and he checked it out to some point he

583
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,580
goes up and down within the university

584
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:01,270
when you go to LA can come back so he's

585
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:03,250
very precise with this his metal can

586
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:08,009
tell you more about it yeah this is a

587
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:08,010
bonus I think we're doing well timewise

588
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,410
so regarding hard work you like okay so

589
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:19,140
we have a microcontroller there we have

590
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:21,700
it before but we loaded or charged him

591
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,350
thing if you want to switch off the

592
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,720
power bank we have that microcontroller

593
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:30,339
so began with the small micro controller

594
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:34,540
to turn off him no I said okay we could

595
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,140
have a big one I bother USB you know USB

596
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:39,170
soap

597
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,520
it's quite fashionable now I'm talking

598
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,890
to them you know having a reliable

599
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,820
access point you can actually configure

600
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:49,850
that loudly for Barcelona which is an

601
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:52,910
older captive portal but there many

602
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:55,220
access parts maslow none so once the

603
00:35:52,910 --> 00:36:00,319
person is connected to the mobile or

604
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:03,950
shouldn't use open Wi-Fi point these are

605
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,030
ideal conditions this offer obviously

606
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,220
needs to be unblocked

607
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,810
but we just want you to check the

608
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:16,390
information and read your things

609
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:19,250
happening now I have another item you

610
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:24,680
I'm from here you can download data to

611
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:34,790
the server it was a very small demo a

612
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:39,680
very short demo molecular composition is

613
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:45,200
Paragon so to sum up we think we've done

614
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:47,310
a great proof of concept sorry

615
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,250
quite successful

616
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:52,940
would your test last year I'm sure that

617
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,940
better solutions

618
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:03,360
in this area and we think he's been

619
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:06,990
successful there is feasibility the

620
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:10,170
hardware is our available in market he's

621
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:13,470
not something esoteric if you leaving

622
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:16,440
our city such a small diamond trade you

623
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:20,310
can go to buy electronic or even 12

624
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,890
Express largest source you can have

625
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:29,270
access to the hardware you have

626
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:29,270
implemented two different attack vectors

627
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:35,640
then you can look at whatever you want

628
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,910
there so yeah go to the red casket

629
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,359
attacks and one pose process it out so

630
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,560
what is the illest and something's

631
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,100
missing I wish I could

632
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:50,640
welcome dear me mega to take it to 3.3

633
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:53,190
volts but they have less how ish of not

634
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,730
of a block in the middle micro a few

635
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,940
balls

636
00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:00,150
I have those specs

637
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:04,740
because watch is may different clocks

638
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:08,070
may be different so Moe's experiments

639
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:11,970
are done with these item and Mars

640
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:17,340
official Borseth are 3.3 berlin fruit in

641
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:19,770
China you can find non hard winged words

642
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,690
with his controller and instead of five

643
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,670
like the other one go at three point

644
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:28,560
three and that will open the door to

645
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:32,990
program the ESP from these gone here you

646
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:39,330
also want to improve the current sensing

647
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:41,339
we have put it on an i2c sensor and the

648
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:44,730
output Sherlock could also be improved

649
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,770
for bank entities for ads during decay

650
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:51,300
different things and time wise who can

651
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:57,060
do it and regarding the tax yes when I

652
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:59,670
showed the slide earlier there was an

653
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,570
area reserved for the OTA and that's

654
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,690
quite interesting

655
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:08,310
we've done some short tests agree fully

656
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:10,500
to rate hojae's over the air and here

657
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:13,560
you could update things over the year

658
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,630
the firm were basically physical access

659
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,430
without power bank to update the

660
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,110
firmware because we can implement

661
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:22,350
another attack could do anything you

662
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:25,030
want only change your thumbs and we can

663
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:27,130
have remote access to it

664
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:30,550
so these may be wrong in the conditions

665
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:34,720
that give your least half of the

666
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:38,890
remember available and then you can

667
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:42,089
delete all the rest compass hardware and

668
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:44,680
you also get half of the flash available

669
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,450
these are functionality quite

670
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,970
interesting we've worked with it with it

671
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,799
is not fully implemented so that we

672
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:53,500
cannot show to you but is that and we've

673
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:58,210
seen produce from people where I will

674
00:39:53,500 --> 00:40:00,550
put the Wi-Fi antenna monitor mode and

675
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:03,280
they could play with it in fact there's

676
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:08,230
a library I want to get how love called

677
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:11,910
exploit as ESP I don't know whether you

678
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,910
know it or whether you've worked with it

679
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,970
I'm gonna check that we get github after

680
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,520
this and what else

681
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:22,910
well there is harder because right now

682
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,340
we only have client multi USB the prefer

683
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:27,859
concept was something to janitor we

684
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:33,080
could have a valley USB all of our

685
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:36,130
device which is not coming and the power

686
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,779
bank is connected to the mobile device

687
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,590
so we don't need to connect it to a

688
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,170
faucet

689
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:45,100
well there are however some devices are

690
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,100
kind of obsolete

691
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:56,660
so our doing throughout our line of

692
00:40:51,410 --> 00:41:02,509
boards and we know mega the Hardy k2

693
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:04,850
things with Android with alb but since

694
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:07,670
they started close the Ellery Hale be

695
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:13,150
those libraries are not being user Don

696
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:16,250
work but he chipped marks 34th 21 knee

697
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:18,320
allows you to have up to full devices on

698
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,180
my USB homes then controlled from my

699
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,790
controller and the other day wish was

700
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,100
well why should we have ID be inviting

701
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:30,080
have a you soon as we house and said hey

702
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:31,940
PDP or MTP give me the files so we still

703
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,690
need to research that but I think they

704
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:37,480
have been DeCarlo's we can buy the chip

705
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:41,480
you cannot have access to development

706
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,910
board there are we know manga okay so

707
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,280
you can up like this to our Bluetooth

708
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:49,279
you know if it fits fine why not does

709
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:55,370
the next update of the SP D is p32

710
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:59,660
saying wife I am even more memory why

711
00:41:55,370 --> 00:42:03,380
not and we haven't lost so much time

712
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,629
yesterday quite like taking pictures of

713
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:08,150
power bank so you could see them well

714
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:11,510
with other devices so how I expressed

715
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:14,540
photography course well we have some

716
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:17,720
acknowledgments thank so many people who

717
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,190
have collaborated on this project is one

718
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,649
of two stations of we are both

719
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,450
presenting but with participation of but

720
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:26,030
people borrow a hundred year our and

721
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:28,220
brake is on David many of these people

722
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,110
are here in the front row we also like

723
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,069
to thank the University was known as we

724
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:35,539
said earlier

725
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:37,430
they subsidize part of the initial

726
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:40,039
materials for the tests and gave us

727
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:43,219
permission soon released through the

728
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:44,539
network virtually new anything but here

729
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:48,079
we are a routine and we would like to

730
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:50,539
thank rooted for inviting us saying if

731
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,459
you have any questions or any comments

732
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:55,099
please let us now he's here are our

733
00:42:52,459 --> 00:42:58,419
contact details and these are as always

734
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:58,420
who can help thank you

735
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,650
any questions

736
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:13,800
I do have a question I don't wanna go

737
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,320
you show the file with a without the

738
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,180
logs of the positions of the people I

739
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:23,720
guess through Wi-Fi you don't get that

740
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:25,859
data so how do you find those positions

741
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,009
excuse me I couldn't quite hear you

742
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:33,240
you mean the positions on this path well

743
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:34,830
the key location that you showed well

744
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,299
there's escaped on Python I don't know

745
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:39,950
there are habitat Hannibal I can show to

746
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,950
you later because we have it around

747
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:54,480
API key and you can transfer marks the

748
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,420
power signal

749
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,520
it gives you the points and the Colemans

750
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,740
and you go to your mom's you follow the

751
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,850
dogs so you call the API twice in the

752
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:09,379
first call is for position on the second

753
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:12,660
one for presentation in your location

754
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:16,260
this is triangulation the opposite

755
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:18,180
process the Google car wasn't just do

756
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:22,310
pictures of you they were also getting

757
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,310
data data

758
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:31,940
the phones have all laughs so they have

759
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:34,520
the triangulation process reversely they

760
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:38,110
have you know the power of the Wi-Fi

761
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,110
antennas and they have lots of data

762
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,160
hi good afternoon first of all thank you

763
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:49,170
for your speech it's been amazing

764
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:53,430
initially we saw that us on several

765
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:56,180
boards Muslim raspy zero

766
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:59,308
Rasmus zero so what made you decide

767
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:05,669
jesus controllables disability voltage

768
00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:08,940
and your faith okay so the ecosystem

769
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:11,579
right now since how do we Arduino came

770
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,750
out in all the making industry has been

771
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:16,950
hearing loss of money with my

772
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:19,190
controllers you know it was big boom so

773
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:23,250
why should we just have a it guy zero

774
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:24,960
because that's ready to have different

775
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:27,750
things like a really graphic interface

776
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,940
is no matter how you activate it you

777
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,940
know you could even create a game boy

778
00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:37,640
well we want to go to minimal bare

779
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:41,130
essentials

780
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:43,440
so what is he years because he's

781
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:45,200
disabled if you want you can add 10 guys

782
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,029
there and maybe it's not the best thing

783
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,609
you want to do support with calculations

784
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:53,519
at same time you may need to go to the

785
00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:57,960
Texas were also to others do you want to

786
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:59,788
connect one or two fair enough but since

787
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,210
you are in microcontroller this is very

788
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:05,480
important you're not

789
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:06,800
Yeah right you're working with a machine

790
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,050
you have your specs

791
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,099
you couldn't even you could even put it

792
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,619
into my mouth

793
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:15,230
there's no much battery the battery son

794
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:20,450
so you go like okay this is this guy

795
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:24,940
getting under three the mobile phone is

796
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:27,830
charging you have the USB your talk

797
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:31,990
maybe takes about five minutes but you

798
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:35,359
can work with it in all my controllers

799
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:38,479
harvest leap mowers some of that deep

800
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,848
are usually tabled I can't answer

801
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:45,410
honestly but you have different things

802
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:48,080
that detects us once really work on the

803
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:51,618
power back to some of them from taxes

804
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:54,680
instruments go out of 0.9 volts most of

805
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:57,680
that work at 1.5 in Texas Instruments at

806
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:00,129
Foot Blanc and their consumption is a

807
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,129
lot lower

808
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,160
the University we work a lot to the

809
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:08,850
Texas Instruments once and they have

810
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,580
great energy saving manuals fear hey

811
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:14,339
what made us decide how about this to my

812
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:18,330
Christmas alone we saw cars they were

813
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:20,190
very cheap for two and a half three

814
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:22,560
euros you can find them in any Express

815
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:25,350
and otherwise officially with weren't he

816
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,140
you know for ten years you have one and

817
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:29,970
it's also very cheap they have very low

818
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:33,839
conception so it's a power-packed that I

819
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:38,689
want we want to last even an hour we ran

820
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:42,000
out of battery it's about the game of

821
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:44,310
minimize and resources and maximizing

822
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,170
attack impact and I stress behind as

823
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:50,490
possible well I and thank you for the

824
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:52,830
question in that time I thought about

825
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:57,000
why choosing Arduino and on our though

826
00:47:52,830 --> 00:48:00,960
which is nearly 2.4 rather than the 328

827
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:05,160
the developing a hard hat and have mega

828
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:08,460
16 2 or which is more powerful and less

829
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:12,120
memory so the development a hard or

830
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:14,550
clang of the Arduino no no we know one

831
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,609
you have two microcontrollers and you

832
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:20,670
can do back to us paid you only have to

833
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:23,220
program the microcontroller which is not

834
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,750
the Arduino one which is the other one

835
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,529
that's when the communication is not

836
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:31,790
done yeah it's it lab hot other two and

837
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:35,490
there's a guy who's actually a

838
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:39,140
uploaded the dad so that you can do it

839
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:42,120
directly with an Arduino one in in

840
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:46,200
afternoon where you're born in just one

841
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:47,850
hour so you go around and you end up

842
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,720
with solutions that are that we've

843
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:52,830
looked for solutions that are there

844
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,049
there are people who've worked on this

845
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,430
but partially so we've been integrated

846
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,730
things and it's a good practice because

847
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:03,779
if you start from scratch

848
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:08,280
you could take an stm32 you could use

849
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:11,730
the ACC 3200 the red one which is this

850
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:17,090
can do almost what an open and you RT

851
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:17,090
but you have a different commitment

852
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:33,560
a final question first of all thanks for

853
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:46,820
the talk it's been spectacular I wanted

854
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:48,859
to say to you you are the hardware is

855
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,349
clear how are you doing how about

856
00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:53,420
drivers and the second question would be

857
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:57,830
remember that when you have it on

858
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:59,260
monitor mode the battery is gonna just

859
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:03,500
to warn you

860
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:06,440
yes about what can we do with these we

861
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:10,820
looked at the library that there may be

862
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:16,040
other ones around and we haven't done it

863
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:18,380
yet but just to see that if there are

864
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,680
very specific point in time because if

865
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:25,940
we implemented or that one which weren't

866
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:29,109
about to do it to define when it's

867
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:32,690
executed and when not if we want to

868
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:37,940
localize when this person is home and

869
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:40,000
see if their wife is well he's when the

870
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:44,200
person is at home they will probably

871
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:48,460
recharge their power pounds so you can

872
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:52,759
use the monitor mode you have I have to

873
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:53,300
sort of practice my amps but yes you're

874
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,839
right

875
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:59,710
there are limitations no doubt this is

876
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:03,070
for a proof of concept yeah it does say

877
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:03,070
prefer console

878
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,980
sorry the questions not being asked on

879
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,980
the microphone

880
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:20,000
with it that for the looks yet and we've

881
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,799
managed to do that for Android as well

882
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,530
and I don't think there's going to be a

883
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:28,190
problem with these devices yes for these

884
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:35,810
devices there are libraries maker theses

885
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:41,030
in the hard work you can do it as a

886
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:44,090
modern-day Calvino's or an API and

887
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:45,680
people do it and to act on the SSPs with

888
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:50,780
the generic drivers that are already

889
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:52,669
there but it takes a lot longer okay we

890
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,930
have to stop here thanks very much in

891
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,930
Pilot Knob mouth thank you

892
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,319
