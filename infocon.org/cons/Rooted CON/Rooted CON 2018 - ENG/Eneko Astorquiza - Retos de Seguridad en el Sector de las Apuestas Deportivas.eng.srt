00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,089
Sugoi a male moo-velous a todos muchas

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:16,910
gracias a la route esperar mahogany

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:19,350
rocky ballet to be technical talk with

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,119
cryptography this is the talk of a real

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,100
company and what we suffer or a

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:29,970
day-to-day activities my name is Rebecca

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:32,910
Hart Okita I am in that calm ass I could

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,739
be in charge of a communications and

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,569
security and you know how this works

10
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:42,269
that and the good thing about this is

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,879
that the bucket stops with him so that's

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:52,620
how security challenges in the sector of

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:54,920
sports that's online and we we would

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,570
give it another title or appealing one

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,789
because I never see a lot of you here

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:06,600
but the title that I found was how to

17
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:10,830
win over the sports betting companies

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,860
and this would be full event so give you

19
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:19,670
some context I'm going to tell you who

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,670
we are you realize that we are

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:28,350
it was not working but if I don't

22
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,350
connect it to the computer

23
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:42,329
okay we are a company that came about in

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,969
2002 and we started working in 2008 in

25
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,329
the middle there was nothing there was

26
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:52,158
no betting regulation in Spain in 2008

27
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:54,839
we had the first sort of bets regulation

28
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,780
in the Basque Country where three

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,329
licenses were given one forgot a

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,789
pathetic from pay enough ourselves and

31
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,958
that were the games and betting were

32
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:13,560
started to be regulated potential games

33
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:16,829
with machines in facilities and we came

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,069
out with two we had a previous one that

35
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:22,500
never came out and we were in in

36
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:26,179
catering facilities I don't know if any

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,739
of you are familiar with the rabbit they

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,410
have you seen the story in Madrid we

39
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:36,530
have very few stores in the best country

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,530
but we we have this machines in the

41
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:43,680
Catherine sector so in bars or hotels

42
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:46,170
there are different machines where you

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,810
can place bets and year after year new

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,970
things came up we came out in Nevada in

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,579
the community of Bolivia and at the

46
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,290
beginning we were a company whose

47
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:58,109
vectors very small would have anything

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,220
published in internet it was it was a

49
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:05,250
mere presenter with internal networks

50
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,690
like VPNs and we didn't publish anything

51
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,340
in the internet but what happened in

52
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:13,680
2012 we opened our web page right away

53
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,109
and I change radically we are in an

54
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,930
environment for for the bad guys

55
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:21,959
everybody's trying to hack as we have

56
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,329
many security measures and that changed

57
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,530
a lot our internal architecture we

58
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,840
brought out another machine

59
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,669
calathea Rioja Cantabria more yeah

60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,940
Asturias Madrid here in Madrid we

61
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:36,120
started with our first stores in 2016

62
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,250
new machines came out 2017

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,849
that I want you to realize that it here

64
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,690
in 2002 the company was four people four

65
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:50,190
people who started working and in 2008 I

66
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:52,519
think eight people at most and it grew

67
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,519
gradually

68
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:03,409
so what are we now we are over 150

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,720
employees and all of our staff are hired

70
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:08,689
by a turret even those who are going to

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,819
make a collection to the machines and so

72
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:12,650
the ones in the stores are also part of

73
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,708
their staff this was our idea of a

74
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,590
company we want to own it

75
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:21,380
the average age is 29 in the technical

76
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:22,880
department is 29 years so I'm all in

77
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,889
that department many people with

78
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,800
university degrees and six years of

79
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:30,919
experience it's a young company as I was

80
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:38,090
saying it really started working on 2008

81
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:46,490
and not so much time you first joined

82
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:48,799
our young people so it's all in-house

83
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,780
developed we have developed the machines

84
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,110
we haven't bought to anybody the

85
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:58,698
components of the machines come from

86
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:01,400
different vendors our own and there's

87
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:04,990
just a company that assembles the whole

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,219
thing and it's not in China okay

89
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,580
it's a Spanish company in the basque

90
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,750
country so the philosophy of the company

91
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:17,240
this is just marketing it's in the right

92
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,669
technology is a value who comes through

93
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,139
product were they said you're different

94
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,570
to many companies in our company

95
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:26,900
technology is a value it's not a cost

96
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:32,419
and if we have a technological problem

97
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:34,940
we do not make a buck we we have to

98
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,469
close them the business and go home so

99
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,020
we're not like other companies that have

100
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,909
a product as such they may have a

101
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,490
production chain that can keep on

102
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,860
producing but that's not our case if it

103
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,870
goes down then

104
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,750
and we look for her talent and

105
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,360
productivity and sees the exception

106
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,640
confirms their rule that's why I'm here

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,660
I have no talent and I'm not proactive

108
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,870
but so far so good

109
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,270
I can I get to be on manage so I'm gonna

110
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,970
give you some context this is public

111
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:08,750
information it's published by the

112
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:11,090
general direction of games and badge

113
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,880
here in Spain and these are quarterly

114
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:17,060
reports you have the address today up

115
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:24,170
and in the last quarter of 2017 you can

116
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:27,710
say that this was 1.3 billion euros were

117
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,960
bet in one quarter but if you think

118
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,219
that's a lot this is not all because

119
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:36,349
there are communities that invoice

120
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,710
within the community and it's not that's

121
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,590
not included in this value so the basque

122
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,530
country has not invoices in the basque

123
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:48,349
country and in terms of rata bet they go

124
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:52,359
to the past country section where the

125
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:54,980
people in the state people in

126
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,170
communities go into the wrong community

127
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:00,230
so you can do the numbers in many

128
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:12,290
different ways and about that 1.3

129
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:17,829
billion euros the cross 3 so it's about

130
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:20,139
10% and you can look at the profit and

131
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:23,249
and it's been going up like the VidCon

132
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:28,419
volume so there are more and more beds

133
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:33,609
and it's a drawing problem because two

134
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:35,948
hooves are a pair in a company the

135
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:39,669
different authorities define certain

136
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:43,289
rules but if you look at them what do

137
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:48,698
they ask from us they don't ask for this

138
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:51,669
they demand that our web page should

139
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:54,039
support SSL but you check the different

140
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,139
betting thermos and their secretary you

141
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,979
look at that web page and they actually

142
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:03,519
use an A if how can you do that is it

143
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:05,589
about changing two things or or or in

144
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,439
the wife to change the certificate or

145
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:09,999
the web servers whatever well they

146
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,089
stopped I'm not gonna talk much about

147
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:25,860
this because in the public sector these

148
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:30,459
type of thing finding security measures

149
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:33,399
passwords you know the usual

150
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:37,469
and many paperwork lots of poker with

151
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,469
all over lots of documents

152
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,419
you know meeting the requirements

153
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,570
doesn't mean being secure the

154
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:48,449
requirements of course it from us are

155
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,480
rather to make sure that we have that

156
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:55,020
met the necessary measures to give a

157
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,140
service safe service but they don't

158
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:03,600
focus on the skewed part some things are

159
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:06,030
useful for example having a plan for

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,040
recovery in the face of massages we all

161
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,339
know that when a company begins working

162
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:15,449
this is a plan this is the first plan of

163
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:21,000
any company and they develop it here on

164
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:23,700
so what do we see if we look at what we

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,180
can see in a given day you can see all

166
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,180
these things

167
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:36,350
we have many SQL injection down samhsa's

168
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,350
the roots or SQL injection

169
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:44,989
we have attacks that do not meet the

170
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:48,589
protocol I thank so many vulnerabilities

171
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,000
before I connected to add something else

172
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,740
yesterday

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,339
11 million I different IPS were

174
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,339
connected to our environment

175
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:02,560
and I have taken out a piece that have

176
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,350
tried to access our website can

177
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,359
eventually some speeches they talk about

178
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,540
autonomous systems and these are usually

179
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,270
large companies were autonomous system

180
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:16,540
and well for me while you know we have

181
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,000
all the APS but you see all the people

182
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,400
around I'm talking you all day long and

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,220
a half of those 11 million IPS are

184
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:28,740
attacking ours is coming Paul's we find

185
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,480
anonymous proxies we connect Soudan IPS

186
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,760
the many sorts of IPs are continuously

187
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,730
looking at water we've gone back to them

188
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,510
publish it on the internet if you have a

189
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,840
vulnerability that our target I

190
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,910
eventually found something important

191
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,620
here

192
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,170
everyone needs to take this into account

193
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,510
and your harmfully is in your security

194
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,689
there are many attacks coming from IPs

195
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,580
there are known as malicious I piece

196
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:59,400
your filters

197
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:03,840
please filtered a piece and I'm sure

198
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:08,939
that they will not fail usually the ones

199
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:11,970
different malicious lists ip's need to

200
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,730
be take into account and cut those off

201
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,410
and then they may attack the rest the

202
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:22,560
problems are we find some continuous

203
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:24,870
insecurity all day long why because

204
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,180
anything may affect us may be affected

205
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:30,740
by internal errors my environment errors

206
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,939
a development error may mean that our

207
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,530
system crashes why not

208
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:50,480
I'm sure you've experiencing these right

209
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:50,480
I'm sure like a query SQL database

210
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,850
on the other hand traders our sector has

211
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,230
a few called freighter and just like

212
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:06,750
King in the stock market

213
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:08,360
we have traders who look up to battle we

214
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:14,510
have another figure which other traders

215
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,510
review all the other matches so to say

216
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:21,420
they look at the different possibilities

217
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:25,140
of bats that exist they check that

218
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,760
affect our art checking different

219
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:30,209
sources in the yard on the house and

220
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,450
they also check if the bats of the users

221
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:36,089
are right but they don't do anything we

222
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:39,810
heard and they also check the

223
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:41,190
information that we receive for a bet to

224
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,680
place a bet because sometimes that

225
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,810
information is bad and I'll tell you

226
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,029
about that later on and then my security

227
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,859
the location of the machines we have

228
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:54,240
machines in different places in house

229
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,709
shops bars the shops are ours there we

230
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,440
have more control with the house in the

231
00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:01,469
bars which kind of control do we have

232
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,870
enough done someone could come do

233
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,320
something about my Sheikh and we cannot

234
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,320
do anything

235
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,950
that might be a bit problematic because

236
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:19,150
the machine has money inside so father

237
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:20,380
his money may be bad for about he's like

238
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,569
it with there's a lot machine and

239
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,310
someone comes to take the money so it

240
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,260
may come to me take the money with all

241
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,329
machines they're not gonna try to reach

242
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,770
us afterwards there is money the first

243
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,570
thing that want is to take the money or

244
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,490
take the machine if they cannot open it

245
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:37,300
which is something that has already

246
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:39,850
happened internet isn't worse because

247
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,920
that makes you spend more money it's

248
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,920
been a lot of money just in case usually

249
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,689
and you seal us in secure

250
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,570
whereas notes if you got some people say

251
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,750
well look at their tongues but the more

252
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,310
simple thing is may harm your mouse

253
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:01,210
domain protection okay let's not think

254
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:03,910
that someone might seal our domain what

255
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,010
about dirty ass or whatever because

256
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,900
we've seen it in some suppliers if they

257
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:10,180
come into my domain and they change the

258
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:15,069
DNS it's the my domain is pointing to

259
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:22,000
that collapse in me it's happened to us

260
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:24,070
how some suppliers services some when we

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,830
go into the website we see summarizing

262
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:30,970
look at our DNS they were pointing to my

263
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:32,890
name servers for advertising and when we

264
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:37,540
talk to them they're like okay somehow

265
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:39,610
they they went in there registrant they

266
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,790
change the DNS is this is pointing to us

267
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,580
so they cannot give service unless they

268
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,390
managed to

269
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:52,170
get the door banging judge the data and

270
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:54,990
for 24 hours they're down without being

271
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:57,479
able to do anything being gone for 24

272
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:03,060
hours is a problem for us and every

273
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:05,310
place has different regulations there

274
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,900
are some more less harm less harsh

275
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,939
regulation some of them tell you that

276
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,530
you can only be down fro for a few hours

277
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,000
and if you're bad you got to be fine

278
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,819
they could even take you your license

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,770
out which is even worse

280
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,710
Deanna's okay so apart from the robbery

281
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:23,569
and protection DNS what happened to

282
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:25,620
Mirai well half of the internet was

283
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,890
paralyzed because they attacked some

284
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,840
surfers well that could affect anyone

285
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,310
except for the porn industry they're the

286
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,920
only ones who know how to do a to know

287
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:39,449
how to grab from that we do the analysis

288
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:44,420
and no one in the last no one use in

289
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,420
case you can get away with it

290
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:50,620
don't do s attacks that maybe general

291
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:55,780
external you know about programming may

292
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:58,600
mean that you got something weird and

293
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:01,770
you can get messy all the typical don't

294
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,830
attack people TOS attack such as the f5

295
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:09,160
you know if you press f5 for a while you

296
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:12,210
see that our website keeps going where

297
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,420
some words and then if you stop at five

298
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:19,690
you could not build it you know the

299
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,819
server memory goes up and subsequent

300
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:25,300
service those dealers attack from a

301
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:28,630
single piece of equipment and some pages

302
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:37,089
can be done a DDoS attack that happens

303
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:39,640
on a daily basis every single day for

304
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:42,880
IOT systems that happens on the farmers

305
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,949
was Iraqi accounts you know Sparta here

306
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,550
regarding these attacks that we do not

307
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,710
know that we're experienced in them yes

308
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,140
show the picture said okay all these

309
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,940
attacks that were having but I don't

310
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,550
care about these I care about the ones

311
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,410
that do not be here I do not know about

312
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,880
these ones in a country I can cut them

313
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,010
off but what about the ones who do not

314
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,170
appear here there since I mean and those

315
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,520
are the dangerous ones and those are

316
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:10,140
usually you know they're acted

317
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,889
and what do we get from all of these

318
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,170
well we are scared off well in fact if

319
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:20,790
you think about it a company such as

320
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:23,130
ours if we look at the online part we

321
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,300
are usually scared of this wouldn't heal

322
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,300
ddos attack

323
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:39,418
different ones in 2016 DDoS attacks so

324
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:44,549
if we look at what in cups of the SAS

325
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:48,090
they say the mouse attacks 2017 well

326
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:50,190
done two different websites

327
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,309
this is Saudi Harbor number four tanks

328
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:56,130
if we look at the number of attacks you

329
00:17:53,309 --> 00:18:00,090
get different ones mean if you look at

330
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,350
the number of destination the top was on

331
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,279
two batting cages

332
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:08,399
batting websites so what we're afraid of

333
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:11,370
the most online is a DDoS attack because

334
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:15,059
it can kill the on my part in crashes so

335
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:18,120
what do we do here do we pay or do we

336
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,610
protect I'm sure you come from different

337
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,959
companies and if you don't have a

338
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,820
anti-ddos system and you're thinking

339
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,140
about it

340
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,049
do not tell me that you haven't thought

341
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,340
of this what do we do do we pay if

342
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:34,889
there's an attack unless it's anonymous

343
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:38,370
usually needs to get money people want

344
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:41,429
money so there's usually a threat but

345
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,939
what do we do that now we're paying we

346
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,880
are doing our production and if I pay

347
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,040
all their you stop attacking me

348
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,100
oh they keep attacking me let's say they

349
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,270
don't attack me what if I pay will let

350
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,530
me tell the rest of the community

351
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,590
because this is a community everyone

352
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,320
talks and that ok this guy has bad who's

353
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,879
gonna be got a spade who's gonna be the

354
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,189
next one ok so I'm not gonna pay

355
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,560
overtime do it really by you choice and

356
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,840
we know that I'll be protected no one

357
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,899
really knows and if I protect under the

358
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,669
web so I got rid of the first attack

359
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:19,760
what am I the second one I got 200 Giga

360
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:21,920
will I be able to do something here he's

361
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,390
not just good to do something he only

362
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:33,980
talked to the operators and they need to

363
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:37,670
help me ok we all private companies both

364
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:40,040
of us we could always be a time thing if

365
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:43,730
we were attacked for any reason who are

366
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:47,629
we affecting because it's not just our

367
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:50,120
danger if I'm on an operator and I'm

368
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:53,330
attacked I affect everyone else in that

369
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,550
operator there could be a part of the

370
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,689
private sector or in critical

371
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,379
infrastructures they will also be

372
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,540
affected

373
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,480
so we need to talk to operators sort of

374
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,928
a work

375
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,260
because being an operator is risky they

376
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:10,090
bear a risk if we are there but we're

377
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,429
not just afraid of days there's

378
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:17,590
something that is quite scary due to how

379
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:20,590
business works which is regulations some

380
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,120
point a certain region could come and

381
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,510
say hey you need to comply with this

382
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,850
otherwise you get out and there's a bit

383
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:32,559
of everything in regulations in Valencia

384
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:34,959
we needed to set up two CPD's or 2d pcs

385
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,769
because they told us we need to have a

386
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,500
DPC there everything was working but in

387
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:44,559
balancing I really need to set up a DPC

388
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:47,799
okay so eventually we need to set up the

389
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,210
PCs and have insecurities in securing

390
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,039
security whenever you need to fix

391
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:54,399
something you to do it here here here

392
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:58,020
well fair enough and this may affect at

393
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,059
some point you may need to close up

394
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,899
we don't just need to think about the

395
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:07,049
bad guys all the time we don't just need

396
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:09,678
to protect from bad guys as we have said

397
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:09,679
we have suppliers

398
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,680
and they're in direct attacks I mean in

399
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,690
caucus he's really happened to us in

400
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,500
some suppliers I got some of the

401
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,640
supplier gets shy of service attack

402
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,520
affecting the infrastructures of the

403
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,590
actual service supplier and indirectly

404
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,240
that affects us he may happen to all of

405
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,240
us to any of us

406
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:42,430
and what about the feeds we have 350

407
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,770
people so we cannot have people playing

408
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,270
every single March because we don't just

409
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,670
have matches in Spain we have matches

410
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,280
all over the world

411
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:54,040
there's no curve there of everything

412
00:21:51,280 --> 00:22:00,070
so usually suppliers the sender's

413
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:01,510
information continuously 24 hours long

414
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,370
because in this sector are two things

415
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,500
first of all the bets that you can do

416
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:10,209
well so that this will happen tomorrow

417
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:13,570
visa March and then the life you can say

418
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:16,300
okay the next corner cake will be by

419
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:19,870
these team and after that cake there's a

420
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:24,490
new bet so all the time there are price

421
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:28,239
changes if they close to the our team's

422
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:30,700
area it's more likely for that team to

423
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,380
have that corner kick so the percentage

424
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,470
changes and other information is to be

425
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:42,220
given to us or if it's wrong though what

426
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:45,490
do we do things have happened finished

427
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,730
the bank's some supplies haven't said

428
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,700
well these March finished if they say

429
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,960
that in the infrastructure you can still

430
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,630
bet on the March

431
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,670
so that's EC I go place a bet and I

432
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:02,800
earned that money it's not one looks at

433
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:03,900
the heart in the traders 24/7 365 days a

434
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,350
year

435
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,120
if they look at this you know this may

436
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,539
happen about wrong prices sometimes

437
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,178
prices are crossed all inverting if you

438
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:17,279
know that the Maria's gonna bring or

439
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,140
person was gonna wait you know you got

440
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,929
me my gather on pricing or the wrong

441
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,200
names and people who use that to take

442
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:28,200
advantage of course and then the speed

443
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,000
of information treatment this is a pre

444
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,909
important if I don't get something time

445
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,289
I've a cannot process it in time if I'm

446
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:36,620
going to saturate you for another reason

447
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:39,090
because developing is something modeling

448
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,779
and that information processing has been

449
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:44,428
done by a developer so one who mary fail

450
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:46,159
so if i don't do that in time that might

451
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:50,270
mean that it's useless

452
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:55,049
so in development we may have box

453
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:58,139
batting logics these may be controllable

454
00:23:55,049 --> 00:24:03,299
but my stuff but we have more things the

455
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:05,840
users users are continuously looking for

456
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,840
mistakes

457
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:16,250
it may be a problem and so machines

458
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:19,130
world allowing you to better for free if

459
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:26,650
that happens you always win you bet for

460
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:26,650
t1 t2 sometimes you may lose but well

461
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,480
and then we have the way of living

462
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:37,310
service or private service some people

463
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:40,060
take advantage and they use a tax there

464
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:44,409
are social tax they can go to the store

465
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,409
and do something with a shopkeeper

466
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,040
and please do not you know beside my

467
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:56,840
words and all may become Biggers but

468
00:24:52,040 --> 00:25:00,049
some people come to an agreement to this

469
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:03,649
truck the shopkeeper I tell them that I

470
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:06,620
want to take it someone else conscious

471
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:09,679
it as well you know they try a few

472
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,199
different things or they may be wrong

473
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,710
much instead of saying what really says

474
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:26,299
it has not really and the guys the guy

475
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:31,330
bets in both so who got tickets because

476
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:34,129
well my services says hey this was wrong

477
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:38,480
this boy he fails so please return my

478
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:40,809
money so you made a mistake so you

479
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,179
should reimburse the money

480
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:46,780
however he should know that we know that

481
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:49,460
he made two beds that can be seen how

482
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,049
and many things are done here and then

483
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,650
we have the boss of the information

484
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:56,750
collection this is quite fashionable

485
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,150
nowadays take information for different

486
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:03,669
pages that occur prices and suppliers

487
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,669
are virtually same for everyone

488
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:13,050
then we apply different prices but what

489
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:13,620
if a supplier changes a price before the

490
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,570
others

491
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,939
you know what the others will do they're

492
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,230
gonna change because there are favorites

493
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,930
on one side but they may be quicker and

494
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:29,280
their boss who do events that are linked

495
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:30,780
to different betting shops if this one

496
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,850
change the price you can go quickly and

497
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:36,060
change is bad because I know is gonna be

498
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:42,240
changed and then tipsters is like in the

499
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:44,970
stock market some people give tips you

500
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,880
should know that in this team on the

501
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,520
second division there they have a

502
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,450
redundancy plan or there you have a

503
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,370
chapter 11 maybe we know maybe your

504
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:00,450
suppliers do not know so there are some

505
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:03,350
giving tips so begins in many bands for

506
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,350
that kind of people

507
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:12,570
and we also have an important production

508
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:15,370
problem which is the identity theft you

509
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,040
know not this is quite a big problem and

510
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,260
we're talking about gaming here about

511
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:24,190
betting and you know miners are

512
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:27,160
important here minors cannot bet and we

513
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,230
need to do as much as we can to make

514
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:35,620
sure these miners are these people on

515
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:37,930
the right should not bad and we they got

516
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:42,489
the bonus to notice we can also do it in

517
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:44,650
shops Brown in the halls know people

518
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,320
under age the writing you survey should

519
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:51,130
be able to along to go in what about

520
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,540
online that's quite difficult there's

521
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:57,490
something I haven't mentioned which is

522
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:59,680
quite important the bet some machines

523
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,360
are anonymous anyone can bet on machines

524
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,820
you don't need to get it and if I don't

525
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,500
as you out to us so do you go to a bar

526
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:09,820
and you bet that's anonymous but not

527
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:12,970
like you requested for some information

528
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:16,020
and some ID but it might get my dad's

529
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,020
idea my mom's idea

530
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,790
you will have different systems try

531
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,890
trying to find our problems we've seen

532
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:30,170
for some day they might belongs to a

533
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:31,760
high school unless the person works at a

534
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,870
high school it's weird

535
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:40,430
or maybe the user Francisco Martinez

536
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:45,949
Houston registered and on the email it

537
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:50,390
says a burrito Martinez okay so we need

538
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:53,150
to look about kind of things amount you

539
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:56,120
know like hey take a selfie of yourself

540
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:58,190
with your ID request that kind of things

541
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,770
and we see all sorts is amazing what

542
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:04,640
goes through kids minds we even saw a

543
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:07,220
guy you know promising with his mother's

544
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,780
ID he was taking selfie and you're like

545
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:13,790
hey what are you on about

546
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:17,840
or even this one a mother was sleeping

547
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:20,120
and the ID was being held next to her

548
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,689
face by someone else you know these

549
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,820
things do happen

550
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:28,520
and well kind of crazy but not just

551
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:31,000
people on the right some people have

552
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,760
been banned from betting there are the

553
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,890
denial lists given by the government or

554
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,680
the different authorities so we also

555
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:42,590
need to do some checks online need to

556
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,810
check okay so this ID has been forbidden

557
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:47,720
access and they cannot register we also

558
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:49,950
have the betting it means you know these

559
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:53,979
are some risk control

560
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:56,519
not everyone come back the same thing so

561
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:59,169
maybe add more some people maybe less

562
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:02,529
however some people have certain limits

563
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:04,749
but they don't want so they try to

564
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:08,799
rewrite activity that they create more

565
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:11,169
users but this is easier to detect

566
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,509
because usually they have pretty simple

567
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:17,109
game balance and we have our own

568
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:20,019
intelligences and our multi-process is

569
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:23,699
able to detect patterns to be able to

570
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:23,700
infer those people okay

571
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:32,830
I'll show you something to chart the

572
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:35,428
bots just an example that we see about

573
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:37,480
about we were able to attacked usually

574
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:40,390
that if you can activate some

575
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,419
transactions we pretty much know how

576
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:46,809
much questions there are but 100,000

577
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:50,860
requests or 200,000 for the same IP is

578
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:55,178
now very normal so this is actually an

579
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:57,639
IP without earnest which is quite

580
00:30:55,179 --> 00:31:00,669
important no use of energy there and

581
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,490
they have answers to details menus so

582
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:06,630
this is a person and we will let them do

583
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:09,669
that our problem sometimes service

584
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:12,190
suppliers will check the prices of other

585
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:15,309
platforms okay fair enough they don't

586
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,270
affect us then other interesting things

587
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:19,660
such as this one

588
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:21,639
remarkable this a little by little but

589
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,610
on the same IP you have four users were

590
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,360
happy and they only connect to the main

591
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,949
page and now that details or anything it

592
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,030
is usually something who is doing

593
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,799
testing so the first mistake here

594
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:39,059
it was just a mistake we haven't cut

595
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:43,190
anything we know they are and here is

596
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:48,899
their name I have their lovely he I know

597
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:50,549
the foe I know they leave I can call

598
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,380
them and say hey what are you what are

599
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:55,520
you up to

600
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,520
but they're not doing anything illegal

601
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:02,280
please so far so once I start doing

602
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,289
weird things we put that IP a monitoring

603
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,168
system just in case he began doing weird

604
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:11,490
things so protection measures this is me

605
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:13,590
here I have no talent I stopped said

606
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:18,120
you're doing a bit of everything with my

607
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:20,220
equipment and we try to manage the

608
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:24,379
different things that might happen some

609
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,380
of them may be now infrastructures

610
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:31,350
okra plant from half like ours a unti

611
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,240
deos system and he's not just so how

612
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:36,178
about it's not just good - how about you

613
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,299
may have this vise support because you

614
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:43,169
can bear without from it you happy

615
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:45,720
Hannukah giga you wouldn't have much far

616
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:51,720
wall of how many of you have ever

617
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,460
managed when we sit above any of you you

618
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,950
have many problems right usually get a

619
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,630
laughing you look a while I'm so cool

620
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,480
I'm gonna put this here close everything

621
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,610
in your application crashes everywhere

622
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:06,330
okay so what do you need to giving here

623
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:08,340
here here I researched this everything

624
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:11,850
is perfect it works for a while or

625
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:15,149
happens all applications from life they

626
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:17,908
get updated I may show different 12

627
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:20,640
mistakes and errors sometimes the

628
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:22,409
security team he's working with

629
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,220
environment team all day long to say hey

630
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:28,590
there's no thing you got lots of weird

631
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,830
things you get lots of requests so I cut

632
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,928
off due to weird things quite harsh with

633
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,320
wife boxy sometimes something unites a

634
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,539
harsh

635
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,658
there goes in the request and that's a

636
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:44,658
random harsh then you gonna text it /

637
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:44,659
okay

638
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:55,990
she calls you make it crazy okay so the

639
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,570
one you need to reject the webservice

640
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:01,120
internal firewall the application like

641
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:05,080
in the database is millions of events

642
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:08,020
eventually you have a cm but for to

643
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,418
unify all the events earlier said that

644
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,250
we want our source and there's only one

645
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,650
thing that'll be our source technically

646
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:17,560
which is the SOC service you don't have

647
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:20,980
enough people right now we have 350

648
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:24,880
people I can assure you that most people

649
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:27,130
they're working the shops but tech the

650
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,080
technically speaking we have a lot left

651
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:33,480
lesser staff than many other companies

652
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,480
in sector where's moe

653
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:40,550
what are we in voicing today some

654
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,720
companies in the sector invoices in

655
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,240
pleasant one huh

656
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:48,370
and yes in marketing they spend more

657
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,370
than our whole yearly turnover

658
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:02,430
who is online be 365 bet365 they have

659
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:05,870
the highest online turnover in the half

660
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,870
of the companies who only do online

661
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,690
they're kind of breaking even because

662
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:15,330
it's a very harsh market what saves us

663
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:20,220
our face-to-face market the machines

664
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:24,140
that we've held forever all we have less

665
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,140
than 1% of the market

666
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:33,740
it's percentile of money but there's a

667
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:36,240
1% so we won two less we want to grow

668
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,490
when Machine said another a production

669
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,040
measure what do we do is machines will

670
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:45,330
have locks now free people who love

671
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:49,410
playing with locks many people

672
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:52,020
productive and we have done research to

673
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:54,660
have a smart locks where intelligence is

674
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:58,349
not the key targets instead is in the

675
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:01,529
connected lot to register or the eraser

676
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:08,430
keys to be able to open it on the other

677
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:11,910
hand we have a millimeter and a half

678
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:14,520
sheet people go to try to open the

679
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,990
machine they take the machine because

680
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:21,270
they cannot open it in the bar everyone

681
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:26,020
will know and we try to have no man in

682
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:29,570
the middle the communication router

683
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:33,530
you put it inside machine

684
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:40,670
every machine is sad for the shops he's

685
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:42,590
connected to the internet line we pay to

686
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:45,130
the bars the fabric goes into the

687
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:48,770
machine there's only a fiber outside

688
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,810
communications cabling and we do that so

689
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:53,240
they cannot feel it with them some of

690
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,210
them have routers outside and see what

691
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,419
you do but there's another problem here

692
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:02,480
about if there is no DSL or fiber what

693
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:07,790
do you have there broadband well place a

694
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:11,900
3G prize inside they can come with

695
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:17,540
different tools and make a mess so that

696
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:20,510
insecurity if we go in three he's but a

697
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:23,450
machine cannot do much it's like a silly

698
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:26,480
screen he just has the money he's a

699
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:29,779
software managing devices it has the

700
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,260
other thing is user screen so against

701
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,869
our our infrastructure not much can be

702
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,880
done but not everything is

703
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:39,470
infrastructure and machines we are a

704
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,250
betting shop

705
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:46,430
so we need to protect our backs and

706
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:51,260
betts have different elements betting

707
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:53,839
time controls someone bets that a will

708
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:56,170
win and B win to the same time something

709
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:00,170
we will happen because that's not normal

710
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:04,790
they lose money so you have controls

711
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:05,870
type of bands we have read things and we

712
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:32,120
review the information coming from

713
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:35,750
suppliers we also have I apply that

714
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:39,560
amount system and those bats have been

715
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:42,470
really made by apart no beds so that

716
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,900
possibility of betting is not reliable

717
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,910
anymore for me I'm having some social

718
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,520
problems maybe mine might be the spires

719
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:51,140
but I cannot allow people to continue

720
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,330
betting have a risk this is him

721
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,850
launching an element system for that bat

722
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:58,480
and that ball goes out whoever try so

723
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,480
bad can now

724
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:05,859
you know the former batters maybe to

725
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:10,469
advantage of that Marty career variables

726
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:12,909
for automatic control of allowed risk

727
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:16,029
when I heard that I thought great but

728
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:27,659
basically it's any better has a very

729
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:38,609
limit if I say that's for that much

730
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:41,049
games I can say I can allow for more

731
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:43,449
better or not for one protect our game

732
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:45,189
because I have to birthday to risk you

733
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:52,659
have to take into account that everybody

734
00:39:45,189 --> 00:39:55,449
believes or look the companies they

735
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:58,419
compare them with with machines for

736
00:39:55,449 --> 00:40:01,900
button but it's but we with better

737
00:39:58,419 --> 00:40:09,219
imaging or game we do not keep a

738
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:10,409
percentage it's the Texas that ever let

739
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:19,390
works that way

740
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:22,989
for us there are days where we sometimes

741
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:31,408
there is a day in the league that we

742
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:34,859
know who's going to win of the large

743
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:34,859
large account

744
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:41,440
the thing is there are so many beds that

745
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,940
idea the other day we end up winning and

746
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,619
I've shown you that in the last quarter

747
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:57,250
more light than if it had been ten

748
00:40:44,619 --> 00:41:23,800
percent of invoices 103 in a quarter we

749
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:26,140
never cut in outlets because online you

750
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,700
know who is betting but in percentual

751
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:33,339
betting then that person is and I can

752
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,950
see strange things that are happening

753
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:40,740
the different machines and I can set

754
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:40,740
limits by machine that you cannot better

755
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:58,150
by day we have some 400-500 live evac

756
00:41:54,070 --> 00:42:00,310
events and there are many options for

757
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:06,760
that if we seen each event who's going

758
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:09,490
to score the next goal but in and for

759
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,830
everything else there are 75,000

760
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:16,470
allocations of results per day these are

761
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:19,420
better have been closed on that date and

762
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:21,310
20,000 transactions per second this is

763
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,560
what the monitoring of the databases

764
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:26,200
says but that's not the case if we

765
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:29,110
really looked at transactions per second

766
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:33,490
that are really related with bets we

767
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:35,890
might be talking about some 400 500 but

768
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,569
there are a lot of transactions of the

769
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:40,060
databases that they are about the

770
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:45,490
information so what I've said earlier on

771
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:52,540
were below 1% online go to 3 being 65 I

772
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:54,549
can only imagine or go to the ibex 35 if

773
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,340
I look at the problems that I have well

774
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:02,980
imagine if you go to ibex 35 and I've

775
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:05,140
been talking to other suppliers and they

776
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:10,600
have a lot of protection but

777
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:13,509
nevertheless they if if they really want

778
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,680
to do damage to you it's going to

779
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,450
they're going to succeed

780
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,220
so our conclusion has to be that there

781
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:20,410
are always enemies we're going to have

782
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:24,549
the bad guys outside they're always

783
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:30,009
going to be there trying to to damage us

784
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:31,810
and to as much as we're going to do our

785
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:35,440
best and we're going and we'll keep on

786
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:38,350
moving forward and we base ourselves on

787
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,760
our results we talent and I wanted to

788
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:46,120
say here that if you want to work forget

789
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,280
about the betting sector it's about

790
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,529
technology and think and we believe

791
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,369
we're always hiring we believe that

792
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:56,289
talent is difficult to find when

793
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:58,059
when you do not allow for our remote

794
00:43:56,289 --> 00:44:03,219
working and I can say that if you want

795
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:05,439
to come to work to do a nice place these

796
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:08,019
are the view from our coffee place and

797
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:13,689
sometimes there are cows around but we

798
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:15,999
seem to have eaten them and Wednesday

799
00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:21,669
before I came here something very nice

800
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:26,198
happened in Bilbao this was our office

801
00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:28,209
on one thing it looked great but if your

802
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:30,959
would consider coming to work through

803
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:35,799
will bow and treta this is not reality

804
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:36,578
this is you have to know that it's going

805
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:40,059
to rain

806
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:43,779
but nevertheless we encourage you to

807
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:46,689
come and we want to have you so if you

808
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:48,759
want to send us your CV we are looking

809
00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:50,709
for a lot of development because at the

810
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:54,449
end of the day we are a development

811
00:44:50,709 --> 00:44:57,519
company but we also have machines so

812
00:44:54,449 --> 00:45:01,829
we're interested in you so that I don't

813
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,828
know I thought I wanted to tell you

814
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:20,970
if you have questions I'd be delighted

815
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:29,760
to take them with the machines aren't

816
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:34,250
they or somebody who is in the black

817
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,250
players maybe years in those machines

818
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,109
when you go to our stores there's

819
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,670
control first times here in Madrid there

820
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:44,460
are things that I've left out in Madrid

821
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,740
the regulations are that you have to ask

822
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,049
from everybody that comes into the

823
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:51,750
storage you need their identification

824
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:56,880
card and you check on a list of people

825
00:45:51,750 --> 00:46:01,170
who are found money laundry in there are

826
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,210
no limits for how much you bet in in the

827
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,760
basque country the maximum that you can

828
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:08,700
make is 50 euros I think it's gone up to

829
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:12,470
a hundred so each community has its own

830
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:16,078
regulation so if I limit the type of bed

831
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:18,450
the moneylender I can I can check online

832
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:23,220
where you see that a bit more clearly

833
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:26,069
but we're always looking out for money

834
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:30,149
Andre because it's important for us we

835
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:32,430
can get a huge sanction but when dealing

836
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:36,030
with machines is difficult to to control

837
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:39,299
what happens in hotel in catering if a

838
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:41,849
guy comes into a bar and they introduce

839
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:45,359
50 years here and there even if it's in

840
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:47,069
the simplest but because this is all

841
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:52,520
about probability but if you look at a

842
00:46:47,069 --> 00:47:12,359
much or a game and you're looking at

843
00:46:52,520 --> 00:47:14,819
soon I wanted to to down their money

844
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:16,920
they will have to do it 50 by 50 years

845
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:19,200
and I think that there are no limits

846
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,650
here in in Madrid that there are all

847
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,649
these doors

848
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:32,390
how difficult or how long has it taken

849
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:35,120
you to adapt ECM platform to the

850
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:42,580
specific specificity of the sector of

851
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:44,210
this company yeah this sector you're

852
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:47,840
you're nasty

853
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:50,090
well the CM wasn't too hard whatever it

854
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,670
is true that we have a soft behind and

855
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:56,240
we've had a lot of support I before that

856
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,370
I learned how the platform work and with

857
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,439
my colleagues we tested all of the same

858
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:02,359
platforms available and taken into

859
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,920
account that we are very limited in the

860
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,620
sense that we don't have a lot of people

861
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,870
when I say that there are few of us that

862
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:11,359
were really a small group other people

863
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:15,740
can have twice as many resources with

864
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:19,040
our own size so we have assessed all of

865
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:22,310
the tools just I think we assessed the

866
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,860
seven different teams and which shows

867
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:27,950
the one that gave us a greater

868
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:32,090
versatility with the less requirements

869
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:34,700
so easier to use so integration for

870
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:37,640
instance of all the events in the CM

871
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:40,700
that's easier so I have like very three

872
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,339
different hats that was the easiest with

873
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:46,250
tunnel deployment in all our servers of

874
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:49,610
is low agent with the same configuration

875
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:53,030
and you send them to the same two places

876
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:55,700
and then in all network devices the

877
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:58,460
communications on bins have at the same

878
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,859
and at the end it's a single location or

879
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,780
really two locations where all events

880
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:07,720
are received and for instance the first

881
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:10,300
place used to collect all events

882
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:15,069
and test all the tools and you start

883
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:16,869
testing that was simple the logical part

884
00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:21,279
which is what were interested in were

885
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:23,890
still developing the CM really has been

886
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,720
working for a year and in one year we've

887
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:28,029
made a lot more information that we

888
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,009
expected to get but in cm you need

889
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:34,319
somebody to be checking it all the time

890
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:34,319
all the time and we're working on

891
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:44,720
I think we know each other yeah you've

892
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:49,310
talked about the problems that you're

893
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:51,560
finding in security service the denial

894
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:53,990
of service have you considered having

895
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,509
somebody doing those tests on your

896
00:49:53,990 --> 00:50:01,459
machine because you talked about 3G that

897
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:07,430
somebody can come and really wouldn't it

898
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:10,070
be better for you you're talking about

899
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:14,500
Israel and you can do something about an

900
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:18,380
altar cipher communications well all our

901
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:20,810
communications the entire are sitting

902
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:26,090
machines but all the traffic they

903
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:29,480
generate is HTTP so far the man in the

904
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:33,500
middle when I only got a physical medium

905
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:37,850
it's harder if they open and they start

906
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:40,369
testing to get to know me something that

907
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:43,810
doesn't it doesn't get to that we are

908
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:47,090
considering starting strength

909
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:52,160
strengthening internally beyond having a

910
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:53,750
sock to strengthen the internal part and

911
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,990
we're talking about it but we are a

912
00:50:53,750 --> 00:51:00,680
company which is very agile I would like

913
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:04,609
to produce and that's what really affect

914
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:07,480
us to do with organizing our paperwork

915
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:10,670
that's harder for us so we're very

916
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,490
company doing things and it is something

917
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:15,530
that we want to do but we have to get

918
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,689
organized to see how we can do it and

919
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,609
and the first one who wants that to be

920
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:25,250
there I want somebody doing it on our

921
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:29,540
audits but right now we are we contract

922
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:32,210
we have a one external audit a year just

923
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,519
like in the web and everything but yes I

924
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:36,459
would like to have

925
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:40,118
testing those things for me we can talk

926
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:46,868
later you have mental physical security

927
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:49,269
do you have warning indicates that a bar

928
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:52,599
is actually manipulating that machine

929
00:51:49,269 --> 00:51:58,808
because if they really yes the

930
00:51:52,599 --> 00:52:00,759
collectors go everyday to old to every

931
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:05,289
bar so every two days there is one

932
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:06,789
person coming from the company and if

933
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:09,369
it's been tampered with

934
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:11,799
they will notice and if somebody has

935
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:14,469
been tampered with it I will

936
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:17,919
perhaps I will notice on the same day

937
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:22,299
but the day later I will know hello Anna

938
00:52:17,919 --> 00:52:24,368
Coleman there is 11 parts and thanks for

939
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:26,619
the representation very interesting one

940
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:28,989
and very precise I want to ask in this

941
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:30,609
great question and it's some information

942
00:52:28,989 --> 00:52:32,259
that you probably have when things go

943
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:34,149
wrong we know that professor securities

944
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:40,630
are next years and I'd like to know if

945
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:43,089
you know we had and this for surprise

946
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,769
how much did it cost can you give us

947
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:46,869
that information when you've had an

948
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:50,019
incident that has an economic impact

949
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:53,109
which is probably what what gets our

950
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:57,519
salaries I don't know because I want to

951
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:59,880
touch now there's plastic here right now

952
00:52:57,519 --> 00:52:59,879
as of today

953
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,289
a security incident as such we have not

954
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,629
had and that's why I wanted to touch

955
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:10,359
wood because I say were small but if we

956
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:22,559
look at you've mentioned 11 paths you

957
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:25,930
come from there yes I know in our case

958
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:30,730
we were lucky because when I cried

959
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:38,078
didn't affect us but we are young and

960
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:40,180
therefore Taliban's there's no port 4 4

961
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,670
5 and they want to cry and that sort of

962
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:45,519
thing doesn't get to us we've had no

963
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:54,609
security incidences we have had near

964
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:57,640
misses in direct attack but I am not

965
00:53:54,609 --> 00:54:00,250
aware that I have heard of having an

966
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:02,680
attack but but that doesn't know or

967
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:08,170
doesn't mean that I haven't had because

968
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:10,808
how long does a company to realize that

969
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:12,730
say how long does a company to realize

970
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:15,279
that they've had an attack it's a two

971
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:19,240
years or a hundred days or yes we have

972
00:54:15,279 --> 00:54:21,940
to redefine we do not have credit cards

973
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:27,879
but somebody who actually uses through

974
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:29,410
BOTS through any information internal

975
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,079
information that they may have or

976
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:35,288
insider information that has had an

977
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,329
attack that has arrived and economic

978
00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:39,069
impact you have had some of that yes

979
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:41,380
there are users that try to look for

980
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:44,200
weird things they want to get in

981
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:47,769
internal some hard insider information

982
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:50,740
they used to be defect in our platform

983
00:54:47,769 --> 00:54:53,769
we had applied and logic and we knew

984
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:56,069
that it could that the condition could

985
00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:57,808
happen and that was exploited

986
00:54:56,069 --> 00:55:00,329
that means that somebody has given

987
00:54:57,809 --> 00:55:02,699
information and somebody is using it

988
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:05,369
somebody who started betting and

989
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:10,499
claiming a badge and getting benefit

990
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:12,479
from that we've known that but when we

991
00:55:10,499 --> 00:55:17,569
talk about a security breach what can

992
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:21,328
happen is that somebody can money

993
00:55:17,569 --> 00:55:23,910
because confidential information you

994
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:27,119
mention a credit card we do not know how

995
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:29,609
to save them we have external breeches

996
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:34,469
or so but you can steal from our

997
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:43,430
information our DNA our identity cards

998
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:43,430
names emails telephone numbers I have

999
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:53,670
suppliers that have shut something down

1000
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:53,999
for a while and that's a huge loss for

1001
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:57,269
me

1002
00:55:53,999 --> 00:55:59,939
I haven't know how many machines shut

1003
00:55:57,269 --> 00:56:02,249
down what machines we're talking about

1004
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:08,130
it's a lot of money that I don't

1005
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:09,509
yeah that's what I mean doesn't surface

1006
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:11,190
for a couple of hours what's the

1007
00:56:09,509 --> 00:56:16,559
economic impact yes

1008
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:18,269
I've actually looking at our contract

1009
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,420
because just like in machines we have

1010
00:56:18,269 --> 00:56:23,939
statistics of approximately what benefit

1011
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:28,289
we have from every machine and if that

1012
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:31,199
machine is stopped for however many

1013
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:33,690
hours I can guess how much I've lost and

1014
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:36,660
the legal department is going to go into

1015
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:38,699
that and say perhaps we can remove that

1016
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:42,529
from the things that I have to pay for

1017
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:42,529
that but for us it's a problem because

1018
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:52,379
in the best country if we if I depart

1019
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:54,689
from scores down for four hours we're

1020
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,630
not only getting fine but you may have

1021
00:56:54,690 --> 00:57:00,560
their license removed

1022
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:03,780
you know what that entails that is huge

1023
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:07,400
so the economic impact is that case

1024
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:10,200
would be you cannot estimate it so I

1025
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:15,570
don't know how to explain that that well

1026
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:17,279
I am more into IT we haven't had as the

1027
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:20,040
problem has been that will be prevented

1028
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,310
from giving the service for a limited

1029
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:25,730
amount of time and that means that we've

1030
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:28,920
gone after they come X companies we I

1031
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:30,450
know I'm sorry we have no more time but

1032
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,460
an echo is going to be around yes if you

1033
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:35,220
want to have to ask further question

1034
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:37,980
time around I wish I found some chords

1035
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:40,230
in an order that is new I wish I didn't

1036
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,180
have to rhyme every time I sang I was

1037
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:44,040
told when I get older all my fears would

1038
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:46,368
shrink but now I'm insecure and I care

1039
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,369
what
