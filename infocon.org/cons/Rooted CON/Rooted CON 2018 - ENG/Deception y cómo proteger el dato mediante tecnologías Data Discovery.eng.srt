00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:44,640
data discovery is within the company

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:49,968
with microphones malware and behavioral

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:54,780
analysis and patent search defense

12

inside with barracuda with email coming

in and finally with lead there will give

14
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:04,500
us the overall vision of everything we

have overlooked in our company's next

16

20
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,750
thank you so much one good afternoon

21
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,579
everyone

22
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:03,020
I'll be very brief I'll tell you about

23
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:07,508
what we do blue live monitoring the

24
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,509
external side of companies so to say

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,660
this is where we start and blue live

26
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,859
there's a very wide range of threats out

27
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,930
there if we focus on that concept there

28
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,850
cybercrime there is a certain degree of

29
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,620
complexity in monitoring all these

30
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:33,319
threats we monitor different sources

31
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,440
which are related to these threats so

32
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:41,750
give you an example we're monitoring

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:44,690
passive in tour sites forum forums where

34
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:48,200
cyber criminals share or offer their

35
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:51,920
services they sell their credit card

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:57,608
details they've just stolen we also

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:00,250
monitor for mobile obligation threats

38
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:03,109
leakages in databases

39
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,510
the main complexity arises on the fact

40
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:08,090
that there are many formats here so we

41
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:12,649
normalize the information we enrich it

42
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,870
with our research and then we filter and

43
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,959
categorize it in our own internal

44
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,060
database at the end of the day companies

45
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,090
can configure the domains that IPS and

46
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,420
their email addresses within the system

47
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,030
and as soon as mentions are made in any

48
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,750
of the sources we would notify the

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,840
company that is complemented by malware

50
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,980
analysis that we carry out on a daily

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:44,299
basis we analyze a large amount of

52
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:47,989
variants of malware codes we analyze it

53
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:51,110
we detect connections

54
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:54,470
the type of encryption that is used at

55
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:59,270
botnets the very news we extract data

56
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,870
and we store it because this is data

57
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,670
discovery

58
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,130
apart from discovering the data itself

59
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:13,640
we want have intelligence and context

60
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:16,070
around the data we had a number of

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,050
services on top of that like credential

62
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,510
monitoring something that is closely

63
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,810
related to the round table which is

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:28,070
focusing on data discovery we tell our

65
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:32,240
clients whenever a credential appears in

66
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,980
any of those sites in private forums or

67
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,350
in tour sites where criminal cyber

68
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,210
criminals exchange the information and

69
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,690
also information coming from botnets

70
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:44,359
which is particularly interesting I

71
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:48,310
think that basically 100% of

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,430
organizations having affected computers

73
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:55,160
that can be malware installed as a pony

74
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,250
to steal data to still email credentials

75
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,250
for example those credentials are sent

76
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,550
to the Samba server antibodies will then

77
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,920
use those details for all those things

78
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,930
you know about so it's important to

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,100
detect a threat but it's also important

80
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,020
to say why it is important if you know

81
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,890
what I mean

82
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:20,270
what do threats mean what do they imply

83
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,880
for example when we say that this

84
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:26,000
credential is related to this botnet

85
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,920
that is this malware doing this it shows

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,280
a certain behavior within the sandbox

87
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,940
I'm not sure you're seeing this here you

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:41,469
see the

89
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,680
a flow charts for that malware it is

90
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,870
injecting code into another process it

91
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,490
is creating certain files within the

92
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,910
system it is connecting with a certain

93
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,740
domain with a certain IP address so that

94
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,560
would be what we call the intelligence

95
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,480
around the data and I will discover so

96
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,360
we can extrapolate based on this and say

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,970
this malware is connected to this domain

98
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,150
you've seen this URL but within our

99
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,730
system we have other malware that

100
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,880
connect with the same URL so we apply

101
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:15,790
monitoring or follow-up for that we can

102
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,450
analyze the full domain and say well

103
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:24,090
this domain is related to this IP we do

104
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:26,469
inverse resolution towards other domains

105
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,479
which allows us to detect additional

106
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,010
campaigns when you have detected more

107
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,710
than one campaign you can start

108
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:36,070
distinguishing different patterns within

109
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:38,979
those campaigns to try and find out who

110
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:45,090
is behind the scenes the person or

111
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:45,090
persons this would be the hashes

112
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,310
well we say that this group may be

113
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:54,219
behind this campaign the context would

114
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:57,670
tell us that this is a targeted or a

115
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,850
normal attack it is not just about

116
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,470
discovering it is about providing our

117
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,300
clients with intelligence around the

118
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:10,510
data that we have discovered what each

119
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:13,500
threat implies for each company we check

120
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,500
of this foolish

121
00:07:47,060 --> 00:08:23,010

Ferguson for South Europe so two weeks

293
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,360
ago when I was asked to come here to

294
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,669
give you the sensation for experts such

295
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,158
as yourselves and say well will I be

296
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:49,409
able to do that considering that

297
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,830
managers are not good into technical

298
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:54,450
things anyway happy to my best I don't

299
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,480
know whether you are aware of this topic

300
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,010
it is a very trendy topic and the first

301
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,470
thing that I'm going to do with you to

302
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,899
share three use cases three real

303
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,429
solutions so that you are aware of the

304
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:07,229
problems that we try to fix with that

305
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,090
and then we move on to a couple of a

306
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,590
slides well I will be sharing with you

307
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,470
the architecture that we use for that

308
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,658
the first use case is powder client from

309
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,090
the transportation industry he's called

310
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:21,059
a file repository that is growing a

311
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:24,899
large fuckup takes a long time there is

312
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:29,490
a long big tree of files with the small

313
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:32,340
files users upload that with files but

314
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,169
because of the trade unions I kind of

315
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,149
really go into these files to see what

316
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:38,970
is happening it is there this is growing

317
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:40,649
I am storing them I'm giving them a

318
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,139
storage space but I don't know what to

319
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:47,518
do I need a tool to connect that to

320
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:49,889
analyze scan all the file is just index

321
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,830
them and first of all for that you to

322
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:54,840
tell me what it's in there and so that

323
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,879
the tool is is smart enough that if I

324
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,039
change the extension of the file

325
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,460
continues to tell me look this is a

326
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,590
video this is a word file and what do I

327
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,450
want to do that well I want to do that

328
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,980
for many reasons first of all because I

329
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,049
don't know whether that intelligence

330
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,730
will compromise my company somehow

331
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:14,668
because that information is illegal or

332
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:17,210
because I just want to migrate data to

333
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:21,389
the cloud and I just want to clean up

334
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:23,730
data so use case number one first of all

335
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:28,289
we have to analyze those files and then

336
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:30,539
to attack the meta data of those files

337
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:32,850
this will tell me whether those files

338
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:35,220
have been have not been accessed in the

339
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,658
last two years whether there are 25

340
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,869
copies around

341
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:43,080
whether these fires from I don't know

342
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:45,418
Sadie files or but in the end actually

343
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,269
there are videos okay use case number

344
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:52,710
two manufacturing company of arrow

345
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:53,669
special engines so this client called us

346
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,739
because they wanted to have an

347
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,119
understanding of two repositories first

348
00:20:55,739 --> 00:21:02,309
system and then another one in the set

349
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:04,379
point and then two for us to check that

350
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:06,178
they give us terabyte of intelligence

351
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:09,509
this is what IT people use to share

352
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:12,119
their files okay we'd run the analysis

353
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:14,849
and we found out two things first a

354
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:18,029
plain file with all the keys full of the

355
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:20,070
Wi-Fi or the whole company okay someone

356
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:20,909
has copied that well to move it from one

357
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,359
place to another

358
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:28,039
and it is sitting there okay but

359
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:33,899
secondly we found the drawings of

360
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:36,289
missile from anti-nato so what is

361
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:39,389
whatever comes from okay

362
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:41,129
please sent in the drawing suffice the

363
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:44,008
drawing files and then it is stayed

364
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:49,949
there so with this mean that we don't

365
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:55,109
know what we have third use case banking

366
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:57,869
sector clients concerned about the GDP

367
00:21:55,109 --> 00:22:02,309
are the new data protection regulation

368
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:07,590
and he wants to protect data in his

369
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:13,639
environments so we have Oracle's my SQL

370
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:16,379
my mainframe and a wonderful database

371
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:18,988
and information that I want to look into

372
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:20,549
so I need a to connecting all these

373
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:25,229
environments connecting all these

374
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:31,670
databases and then from grammar that I

375
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:35,960
give to it I will tell him what to find

376
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:41,030
for me so the three use cases cases

377
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:47,300
we've worked on in two months okay so

378
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:55,280
since we started 2018 okay so this is

379
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:57,919
the architecture that we use so we'll

380
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,200
have two products connecting two

381
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,110
different repositories there is the

382
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,360
difference between talking to database

383
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,719
and to an open environment then we'll

384
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,389
have a central engine applying policies

385
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,810
through these two elements against these

386
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,700
overseas repositories so we will not be

387
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,389
only happy with finding information we

388
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:24,470
want to have possibility to act to take

389
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:27,410
action on those data and if necessary

390
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,420
when we find out what they are to delete

391
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:32,450
them if they are to be deleted it's a

392
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,730
mistake just to keep intelligence just

393
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,340
in case we just want to delete anything

394
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:40,730
that may potentially compromised us and

395
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,010
all in all manage that how do we do that

396
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,980
with our three through three different

397
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:48,560
products in our portfolio control points

398
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,500
we'd use it to access these open

399
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,669
repository fan systems will drive you

400
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:59,060
name it so the enterprise content

401
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:02,710
management we use it to access databases

402
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:07,820
and then we have this central engine

403
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:10,100
which is the that was the content

404
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,649
management it is very important while

405
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:16,399
managing data does not mean that you

406
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:19,600
have to move meta data it's about

407
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,360
managing that data wherever they are

408
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,459
okay so these are screenshots about our

409
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,100
tools there are highly visuals in all

410
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,170
the time we have the possibility to

411
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,909
create grammars will have a number of

412
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:35,750
standard grammars already in place

413
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:38,840
however we can create others and compile

414
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:41,049
the grammars that we need for our

415
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,009
purpose and the

416
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:47,710
a view of what we can do in szm which is

417
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:50,590
exactly the same that is to say using

418
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,350
grammars that defined by aspirins as a

419
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:56,590
grammar for the banking sector where we

420
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:59,980
have all the different ways of storing a

421
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:02,289
bank account so that by the time I tried

422
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,389
to find that information I know where to

423
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:12,369
find it okay and this is all for me

424
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:16,738
thank you very much now we move on to

425
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,738
adapt on defense round parrot from Panda

426
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:43,650
hello welcome hello

427
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:47,460
each and every one drawing on one hand

428
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:50,270
told us in terms of data control there

429
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,990
is a big why about that and especially

430
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:57,480
why is about the structure data

431
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,400
companies have files all around the

432
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,210
company in different across different

433
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,880
PCs files over which we have no control

434
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,130
whatsoever

435
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,780
problems about that are well known by

436
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:16,790
all of us lots of data leakage is so

437
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:18,000
clear cases of Yahoo and others big

438
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,930
problems

439
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,030
well these problems have demolished many

440
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:27,720
companies have hurted many other

441
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:31,500
companies significantly so some of these

442
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:36,000
companies the value drop in the stock

443
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:39,180
exchange negative advertising or so

444
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,890
unexpected costs interruption of

445
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:47,310
business etc so what we try to do is to

446
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:50,940
put order in all that because we have an

447
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:55,020
agent in each what place so what we do

448
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:58,590
is to find all the files in each

449
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,510
workplace and then we monitor their

450
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:04,139
information and we check whether it is

451
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:06,930
at risk of me exfiltrated so this is a

452
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,750
demo showing a lateral attack through a

453
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:12,570
file through a compiler so this is a

454
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:15,380
brief example as to how we detect this

455
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,379
type of threats

456
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:31,520
okay give me a sec so hon tell a

457
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,520
practical joke please

458
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:43,890
so the idea is to get a view from the

459
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,600
outside to the inside in the side of

460
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:48,720
deception that is the difference between

461
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,000
setting up your own honey pots in your

462
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,250
company or a sinkhole and then to look

463
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,600
from that from the outside based on

464
00:27:53,250 --> 00:28:00,419
discoveries strategies versus a service

465
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,719
instead well compared to the handcraft

466
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:07,770
such that you made to yourself and then

467
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:11,100
the importance of looking inside no

468
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:13,559
platform so magics with DLP allowing you

469
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,590
to control everything it's about ongoing

470
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:20,399
search also the importance of looking

471
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:25,740
into each excel file when looking into

472
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:30,870
the behavior of it disassembling is or D

473
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:36,780
compiling it as I will just show you all

474
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:38,789
right so this is my example so approach

475
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:42,720
well what do we do with my work we not

476
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:44,940
only trigger and alerts okay let's take

477
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,220
a look at this specific malware we see

478
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:51,179
activity at all times and we monitor

479
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:53,400
what the malware does so we see all when

480
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,490
a full behavior since the beginning

481
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,220
since it has started it went into the

482
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,970
workplace and then we see a timeline we

483
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:06,690
see what it did I'll try to write

484
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:09,450
logging scripts connecting to processes

485
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:12,240
we see all the movements so we are

486
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:15,390
analyzing all that in big Tara and we

487
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,270
receive between 250 and 400 thousand

488
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:21,539
samples that are analyzed every single

489
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:24,059
day in depth our Patera is powerful

490
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:26,340
enough to analyze this high number of

491
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:29,760
samples the sample that I want to share

492
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:32,899
with you in terms of data protection is

493
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,539
this one here which is a file that

494
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:41,370
escaped all the network counter measures

495
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:45,809
so we have this file with no big issues

496
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:48,050
so we look at the activity so these file

497
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:50,720
access the compiler

498
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:55,490
when they did that it generated the talk

499
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,400
as our and went into the car PC and

500
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:03,980
copied all the Excel and Word files to

501
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:08,270
exfiltrate so this is methodology which

502
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:13,850
is usually used in this type of attacks

503
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:18,110
and we try not only for the man were not

504
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:21,830
to run itself but to have to monitor all

505
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:28,159
those files through our cm platform cm

506
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:30,350
platform receives all those events so we

507
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,810
can see all the operations all the

508
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:35,510
actions are done for those files whether

509
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:38,020
they have been opened copied on a USB

510
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:46,220
whether this being an attempt to

511
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:48,620
exfiltrate them so at all times we can

512
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,800
see what happens with that information

513
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:55,159
where it goes to what is done with it

514
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:58,610
we also control the risk of expectation

515
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,680
and what is what's been done with those

516
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:03,169
documents so the idea is to give global

517
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,850
visibility global view as to what is

518
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:07,040
happening to that information where is

519
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,290
that information going for us this is

520
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,389
vital most companies do not have this

521
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,639
type of information this type of control

522
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,200
which we believe is extremely important

523
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,400
alright so thank you very much to

524
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,400
everyone for your attention

525
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:31,309
okay we give the floor to Antonio Roma

526
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:33,289
no sorry to commit verily he will tell

527
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:35,860
us about him she'll tell us about

528
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:35,860
Barracuda

529
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:06,340
thank you very much fun good morning it

530
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,830
is not because we have for lunch okay so

531
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,689
it isn't an honor to be at VidCon

532
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:13,179
surrounded by security experts I don't

533
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:16,710
consider myself to be an expert but just

534
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:20,140
a person who has learned everything I

535
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:21,940
know from the internet and well the

536
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,760
problem with internet so the cool thing

537
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,380
about the Internet is that you

538
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,090
everything is in there the good things

539
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,740
and the bad things these allows us to

540
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,080
get lots of intelligence to share that

541
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:36,280
intelligence entities what have made us

542
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:39,010
experts on this topic so therefore we

543
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:43,200
believe that it is very important to

544
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:47,230
make use of that intelligence to protect

545
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:51,160
data businesses of companies so

546
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:54,090
intelligence against threats and for

547
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,090
data protection

548
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:04,869
obviously

549
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:11,229
one of the most important elements when

550
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:15,759
it comes to these intelligences is pier

551
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:19,059
fishing so well we all know them we may

552
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:22,330
have tried them and see what happens

553
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:31,210
when they are bland company and what are

554
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:33,970
the main risks that companies face when

555
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:37,090
it comes to applying advanced techniques

556
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:39,220
to human deception so we know that there

557
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,980
are more and more complex services on

558
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,350
the internet we have the resume where as

559
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,230
a service available so all these

560
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:50,230
technologies are becoming more and more

561
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:52,570
modular in nature so therefore we have

562
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:56,309
to work at the same level than several

563
00:33:52,570 --> 00:34:02,609
primers and we also have to work and

564
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:05,049
improve these techniques and actually

565
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:08,199
they're also looking for customer

566
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:12,899
satisfaction looking for chat offering

567
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:16,239
chat box in cases of kidnapping or

568
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:19,739
ransomware so they do not only work from

569
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:27,308
9:00 to 5:00 but they have cooled Center

570
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:31,739
ready to take our requests so this is

571
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:35,649
one of the Barracuda systems this is

572
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:40,779
about the tension of advanced threats so

573
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:43,089
Barracuda has an advantage because it is

574
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,730
the manufacturer has the highest number

575
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:47,770
of security devices in place is very

576
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:51,790
same good position to apply security

577
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:55,210
measures so because we have data so as a

578
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:58,660
worldwide level we use a number of

579
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:01,000
parameters so we look for this security

580
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:04,509
so we have learned from the main risk

581
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,799
from society which is Panda Mia's and by

582
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:10,510
applying similar algorithms to those

583
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:12,579
detecting infections and Panda Mia's we

584
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,010
applied them to the Internet so

585
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:15,800
therefore Barracuda system Joe's number

586
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,800
you

587
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,570
number of advanced technologies to find

588
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,810
out what is happening in all these

589
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,640
security devices implemented in the

590
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,850
world to have detailed information as to

591
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,940
what happens obviously analysis of

592
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:35,480
signatures of behavior static analysis

593
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:39,050
and obviously last layer when the other

594
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:43,070
three filters having overcome sandboxing

595
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:46,100
and then from there well we may run or

596
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:48,410
not may not run the file and what with

597
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,420
the intelligence information that we are

598
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:53,690
getting what is information of all that

599
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:56,030
well considering all the devices

600
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,920
available to us we are in a position to

601
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,980
collect information all through the

602
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,530
process up until the data breaches the

603
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,950
company and this can be done anywhere in

604
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,490
the world

605
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:11,390
once the malware activity is detecting

606
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:14,240
any of the layer that layer informs the

607
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,850
rest of the layers so that that

608
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,629
information is blocked in an advanced

609
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:23,540
and in a fast manner so a threat

610
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:27,230
security threat detected in a place in

611
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:33,020
the world is transmitted fast to the

612
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:37,180
rest of the devices in the world some

613
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:42,380
specific example this is what we useful

614
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:45,049
email where we apply artificial

615
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:48,170
intelligence technology to detect less

616
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:51,890
per phishing cases and as well as domain

617
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:54,740
fraud technologies by using D mark and

618
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:57,049
also fraud simulation to have users

619
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:59,720
trains on that why do we do that

620
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:01,790
by applying artificial intelligence we

621
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,859
will be detecting the patterns of

622
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:07,070
communications in place in the company

623
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:12,520
so that we know whether the email is

624
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:16,970
legit or has been changed so we identify

625
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:18,740
abnormal sign else well in the beginning

626
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:22,220
was easier because it was about a bad

627
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:26,669
translation in the email but now we can

628
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:29,339
analyze writing patterns giving us the

629
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:32,550
Clou and telling us this is not widget

630
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:37,320
email and then we put all those systems

631
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:40,020
into quarantine so we used amok to

632
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:43,130
manage that the main domain that's the

633
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,500
best way to check that it has been sent

634
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:50,970
in a legit manner so therefore we have a

635
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:54,960
great capability to protect both senders

636
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:57,990
and recipients as well as a spoofed

637
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,200
emails and we also make fraud

638
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:04,620
simulations in the company will tell you

639
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:09,839
more about it later on because we

640
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:12,450
actually look for those people that we

641
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:16,440
really want to be trained on those

642
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:18,660
specific security buttons also that they

643
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,880
have good training and good awareness

644
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:24,870
about spearfishing

645
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,170
and the actual platform allows us to

646
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:30,900
generate internal phishing campaigns in

647
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:33,570
the company to increase training and

648
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:38,820
awareness of our people so that they

649
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:41,520
become firewalls and I'm ready for any

650
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,580
questions that you may have for me thank

651
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,580
you

652
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,190
now we give the floor to Antonio Ramos

653
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:14,499
all right so see what Antonio has for us

654
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:17,710
sir companies hire him to find out

655
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:24,819
whether that that will be launched chin

656
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:28,359
is feasible okay so thank you very much

657
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:29,470
one when I talked to fun about this and

658
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,960
I said what do you want me to go there

659
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,118
we are not technology providers I said

660
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,009
no no do you come over yeah you come up

661
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:38,349
there and to tell us exactly about what

662
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:41,650
I will be telling you so I will be

663
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:43,960
telling you about transparency guarantee

664
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:49,019
for those of you have the have attended

665
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:51,970
rooted editions before we were here

666
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:57,189
three years ago talking about lids which

667
00:39:51,970 --> 00:40:01,089
is say security rating agency it

668
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:03,400
evaluates the strength of any security

669
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:04,960
measures that are put in place by

670
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,170
companies where the information is

671
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,900
stored but if things have been misplaced

672
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:12,609
but the time has come once you know what

673
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,759
the information is you have to protect

674
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:14,759
it

675
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,379
so for those of you in charge of

676
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,140
protecting you need to know how the

677
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,540
opacity or measures are and for those

678
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,629
who trust you they have a tool that

679
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:31,400
tells them really from the outside how

680
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:36,079
robust you are in your security systems

681
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:38,730
so far everything we had to do this was

682
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,619
perhaps convincing the senior management

683
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:42,900
that we needed a management system in

684
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:46,680
place you will get a twenty seven

685
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:49,619
thousand and one stamp OCU telling you

686
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:56,450
that you are hyper secure that is simply

687
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:56,450
rubbish no one has that

688
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,519
so that only tells you this you order

689
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,229
your security system is well-managed but

690
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:10,279
it can it doesn't say anything about its

691
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:13,489
strength a lot of people forget about

692
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:15,829
their providers you are looking inwards

693
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:18,829
you're looking at yourself without

694
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:20,719
realizing that you may have 300 500 or

695
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:22,849
2,000 providers connected to external

696
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:25,130
systems all over the place and handling

697
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:27,049
information that comes from you in their

698
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,640
own systems and you have no idea what

699
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:31,219
they're really doing with it yeah

700
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,410
sometimes you send them a form and you

701
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:35,539
tell them please say yes to all of these

702
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:38,749
and they always say yes to all of these

703
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:40,640
okay they check all the boxes you store

704
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:46,988
that form and then you say you said oh

705
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:49,819
yes these guys are rocking it anyway

706
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:54,349
that's the world around us okay the

707
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:57,079
optimistic view as one was saying how do

708
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:58,939
we do our appraisals our assessments we

709
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:05,059
have a simple test in place with some

710
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:08,328
1200 questions I mean no no shitty tests

711
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:10,849
in our case but joke society fee if you

712
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:12,619
want a serious test you really need to

713
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:15,650
have all the relevant questions in it

714
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:18,709
these are this is only for the brave for

715
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:21,229
12 main areas of security anything you

716
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:23,269
can think of by the way if you think of

717
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:28,698
something which is not on the slide tell

718
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:32,078
us we will include it in our system we

719
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:35,239
would need to know how secure your

720
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,069
organization is if you want us to take a

721
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,799
look of course and for that you need a

722
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:41,779
proper analysis people are doing that

723
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:43,609
looking at the IP addresses from the

724
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:46,279
outside based on the reputation for

725
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:49,429
those IP addresses I don't want to know

726
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:52,130
how you are doing internally well we we

727
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:57,170
focus on both sides outside on our

728
00:42:52,130 --> 00:43:00,319
inside that's 1161 questions which are

729
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:02,779
mapped to some 30 something regulations

730
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,509
in effect throughout the world this is

731
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:08,059
the most comprehensive set of questions

732
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:09,920
about security that we know of it takes

733
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:13,059
a while to respond to everything and

734
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,059
obviously we

735
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:23,230
tell people whether the D a see an a a

736
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:26,650
be an A or an A+ A+ means invulnerable

737
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:28,450
no way that doesn't exist it means that

738
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:30,610
if you're working with someone that is

739
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:33,160
delivering an A+ service to you it is

740
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,720
less likely that you will have security

741
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,640
problems than if you are working with

742
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,830
someone that has a D as simple as that

743
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,870
okay it's like when you will when you

744
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:44,080
buy a washing machine when you say a

745
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:46,770
plus or a plus plus plus I have no idea

746
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,870
about energy efficiency but for certain

747
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:52,990
you know that an A plus washing machine

748
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:55,630
is better than a C washing machine well

749
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:59,229
as simple as that we want to be user

750
00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:02,950
friendly and we want to help anyone to

751
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:06,030
put in place at all there is real a tool

752
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:08,859
that helps you realize where you stand

753
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:13,390
okay so you need to know whether details

754
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:16,420
but you need to establish a system which

755
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,549
will be proportional to the criticality

756
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,980
of the data that you have and you may

757
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:23,680
achieve at ESEA B whatever depending on

758
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,780
what you use that data for and then

759
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:31,509
there's another part which is repeating

760
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:32,950
this continuously on a regular basis but

761
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,540
I will not tell you about the details

762
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,580
otherwise we'll go straight into dinner

763
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,630
rather than lunch okay there was

764
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,740
everything from me it's always a

765
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:44,950
pleasure to come to rooted con thank you

766
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:47,890
continue our event a hey now just to

767
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:50,850
move on and briefly I have a set of

768
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,850
questions with me

769
00:44:52,690 --> 00:45:00,370
one of those questions I ask why is it

770
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,960
better to use your platforms rather than

771
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:08,790
using your own honey pots and urine

772
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:13,560
things cyber trap technology instead of

773
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:27,130
typical sinkholes and honeypot strategy

774

Eva's acuerdo gracias another question

808
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:39,368
this goes to Jose Miguel how important

809
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:42,460
is it to to do a credential search as

810
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:44,740
early on as possible it is not what we

811
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:47,700
should be concerned with is that what

812
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,700
everyone is looking at

813
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:55,349
well talking about credentials it may

814
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:58,829
sound simple your credentials are for

815
00:47:55,349 --> 00:48:02,099
email are stolen and you might say they

816
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:03,570
cannot do too many things that but the

817
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:07,650
real anything else has a different story

818
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:10,650
in recent years email credential theft

819
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:13,500
theft can be very critical it can become

820
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:16,140
a very strong vector for entry into any

821
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,630
type of organization if it is an email

822
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,029
if it's email credentials it targeted

823
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:24,450
attack may be set up to with someone in

824
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:26,510
the organization sent through someone

825
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:28,919
that knows that person

826
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,390
the target is attacked with spear

827
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,440
phishing if we're talking about

828
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:33,440
attacking systems

829
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:43,290
with a note from an oncological sister

830
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:48,000
attackers may compromise additional

831
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:50,750
machine additional boxes and end up

832
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,120
compromising most of the infrastructure

833
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:55,950
then monetizing the intrusion we have

834
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,529
seen huge gaps in different

835
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:00,930
organizations that started with a simple

836
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:03,660
theft of email trees empathy MIMO

837
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:07,440
credentials so detecting this as early

838
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:11,100
as possible is important if you find

839
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,360
credentials in paste VIN which may be

840
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,160
three four years old

841
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,650
for which spot the password has been

842
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,990
changed that is very different from

843
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:21,150
detecting a live infection within a

844
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:24,029
certain organization there can be part

845
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:28,040
of an attack happening right now okay

846
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:31,110
so the sooner we can do things

847
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:34,110
the sooner we can detect those threats

848
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:39,230
the sooner we can act rather thank you

849
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:42,900
so much for a meal another topic for

850
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:46,590
Holly on the type of patterns you're

851
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:49,320
looking for within the company do you

852
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:51,060
look for all sorts of patterns patterns

853
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,760
that you could look for with there's

854
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:58,549
many things that can be found credit

855
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,550
card details bank account details

856
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:04,950
let me give you an example of the real

857
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:08,940
case at a certain bank where they were

858
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:11,609
doing trading the trading operators have

859
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:14,160
telephone conversations there are tools

860
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:17,520
where everything is recorded and the

861
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,990
regulator's requests that information

862
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,670
for sentence transactions must be

863
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:23,700
submitted because there is a suspicion

864
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:25,349
you should be in a position to find all

865
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,529
that information and not just on those

866
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:30,720
files a structure or unstructured but

867
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:35,480
also the voice recordings for certain

868
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:41,180
transactions all of that can be done

869
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:44,880
thank you and last but not least to Raul

870
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:47,480
on threat hunting what are you doing

871
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:51,119
that makes a difference in your case

872
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,869
well 3 billion events new events every

873
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:57,900
year processed by a platform hunting a

874
00:50:54,869 --> 00:51:04,530
detection platform and leveraging the

875
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:06,510
fact that we quite a few people working

876
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:09,359
on this we can see what the attackers

877
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:12,119
are doing lateral moves the movements

878
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,900
basically in real time we see how these

879
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:18,900
real times evolve we see how they key

880
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:22,170
how they the input goes through the

881
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:24,480
keyboard since we have this enormous

882
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:27,869
really near real-time with big date as

883
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,540
well we can have indicators of attacks

884
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:33,960
and indicators are compromised we go

885
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:36,420
beyond what most people do rather than

886
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:40,890
focusing on a erase or i/o sees that's

887
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:43,470
not hunting that's its detecting we do

888
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:47,549
the hunting part in a Noma in near real

889
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:49,890
time creating attack premises analyzing

890
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,690
movements this is the latest technology

891
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:54,210
that we have implemented and the truth

892
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,589
is that we have been able to extract

893
00:51:54,210 --> 00:52:00,960
quite a lot of interesting information

894
00:51:55,589 --> 00:52:04,259
we've been able to detect intrusions and

895
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,150
a lot of interesting details

896
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,380
when they're there that means that

897
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:09,720
they've gone through the proxy on the

898
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,609
firewall the last part the last mile is

899
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:15,078
a workstation and that is what we need

900
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:19,200
to focus efficiently Thank You prowl in

901
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:22,650
searching for those patterns do we have

902
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:26,339
that for email well a barracuda

903
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:28,230
our philosophy is rather simple since we

904
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:30,210
have protection through the firewall

905
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:32,160
through the email gateway including the

906
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:34,339
backup systems this is very

907
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,140
straightforward

908
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:38,609
talking about email we focus on

909
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,618
integrating and detecting what is

910
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:43,049
happening within the email system as

911
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:45,329
such we use the data who use the

912
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:49,140
algorithms we use their way people write

913
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:51,390
to ascertain the typical pattern of

914
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:53,790
communication how people use their

915
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,200
grammar how people use their syntax in

916
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:58,589
order to be able to detect spear

917
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,950
phishing so it's quite advanced on top

918
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:03,540
of that we want to be able to alert at

919
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:06,379
any stage for example with advanced

920
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:08,790
unboxing we know that there is malware

921
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:11,430
that detects that it might be in a

922
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:13,890
sandbox so he wouldn't get room executed

923
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:16,859
no problem sandbox in is a

924
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:18,810
next-generation system which avoids that

925
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:22,710
detection on the side of em of the

926
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:29,430
malware so we do our best to stay one

927
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:32,250
step beyond the bodies and we have a

928
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:34,529
presence in any stage so searching for

929
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:37,200
patterns and email which is only a

930
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:38,940
natural element of our approach so that

931
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,819
we can update our systems we can have

932
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,859
our systems with the latest technology

933
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:46,920
and procedures in place thank you so

934
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:51,359
much to all of you I know you must be

935
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:56,550
really hungry let me tell you that we

936
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:59,520
are looking for people to work for many

937
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:03,180
of these vendors typically in pre-sales

938
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:05,250
and research so go ahead and sent your

939
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,960
CV if you're thinking of applying for

940
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,040
any positions within any of these

941
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,600
companies

942
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,600
any questions from the floor

943
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:26,910
do you see a trend towards a net that

944
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:33,450
will become impossible to be open since

945
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:35,460
Google are launching protocols like HSTs

946
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:39,270
do you see a trend towards protecting

947
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:41,850
endpoints throughout the Internet well

948
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:43,220
if you ask me I'll say yes that's my

949
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:46,380
that's my job

950
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:50,029
what we have seen is that because of

951
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:52,710
this type of protocols and in perimeters

952
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:55,170
it's getting more and more complex

953
00:54:52,710 --> 00:55:00,650
seeing what is happening is more and

954
00:54:55,170 --> 00:55:00,650
more complex can you hear me

955
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:05,839
if we go to the endpoint we see

956
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,839
everything

957
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,319
so we are in the right place

958
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:18,680
but with this new protocol so cannot be

959
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:21,170
seen they are making things more complex

960
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:23,509
in terms of the perimeters but we are in

961
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:25,849
the end point and that makes life easier

962
00:55:23,509 --> 00:55:28,219
for us if you take a look at companies

963
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:31,249
focusing on the perimeter they've

964
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:33,979
actually acquired companies that focus

965
00:55:31,249 --> 00:55:37,098
on securing the work station or the

966
00:55:33,979 --> 00:55:40,749
workplace so the trend is clear towards

967
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:40,749
the workplace rather than the perimeter

968
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:50,500
so nothing else thank you so much

969
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:50,500
[Applause]
