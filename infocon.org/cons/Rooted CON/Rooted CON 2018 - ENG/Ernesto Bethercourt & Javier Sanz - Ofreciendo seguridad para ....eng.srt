2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:17,789
hola hello good morning thanks for

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,419
coming first of all this is a difficult

4
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,650
time right before lunch I'm glad that

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:36,320
this was interesting enough for you to

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:44,120
come our talk as the title says security

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,120
paradigm security

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:01:12,860
we look at the problem we face and our

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:20,420
approach I for we're part of the group

10
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:24,820
will be a will make the interaction the

11
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:29,330
first part of the talk can you hear me

12
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:31,940
okay first of all hello thanks for

13
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,090
coming it is a privilege to participate

14
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,700
in the return I hope I don't bore you

15
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,890
those of you who are dying to the

16
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,720
technical part I ask you to be patient

17
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:52,399
because I think it's interesting to have

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:54,440
the context so we're moving in will tell

19
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,410
you later on so where do we come from

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:04,610
in the context of our customers we come

21
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:09,500
from with somebody they went to the bank

22
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:17,599
to update their card and then we moved

23
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:20,599
on to the bank teller machine where we

24
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,760
did that through internet but now what

25
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:26,209
we have a situation we have is that

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,780
everybody can operate with a with mobile

27
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:31,520
phones with smartphones and I'm given

28
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,130
the case for my father or for my

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,520
grandfather and how does that change the

30
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,900
situation for us well we get a lot more

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,849
transactions and and you think well

32
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,640
that's great that that means more money

33
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,530
but if you look into what's happening

34
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,940
you've realized that not all

35
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,360
transactions generate

36
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:53,840
income most of them are actually just to

37
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,450
look at the balance or just it's about

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,410
information so that gives us a lot more

39
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:05,000
of a bigger burden without any profit

40
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:12,890
and that in dangers our computer

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,830
infrastructure we used to come to to

42
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:19,880
live in a world in which we are

43
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:23,120
competitors and in the current world we

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,250
are not we the FinTech have come around

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,200
and we find ourselves in a new situation

46
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,850
that we cannot control because this

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,950
FinTech companies can make daily

48
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,440
releases they have an incredible

49
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,200
productivity and that's not all they

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,390
have a time to market of any idea for a

51
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,040
week of just weeks and we are not ready

52
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:47,769
to compete with them why because we have

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,769
we work for a typical company that has

54
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:54,650
with IT for years we have a monolithic

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,440
application we have data all over the

56
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,290
place with processing cycles that are

57
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:06,350
incredibly slow that eat up most of the

58
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:11,269
day and we have little ability to use

59
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:13,850
advanced intelligence tools context we

60
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,500
find that different geographies have

61
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,930
different technologies and that entails

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,940
a lot of cost and link to the current

63
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,660
situation that I've described means that

64
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,700
the model is not viable and therefore

65
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,580
this is the current situation we are not

66
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,340
doing things because we have our CEO

67
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,260
talking with another CEO and that

68
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,469
they're saying I'm doing I'm computing

69
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,240
in the cloud and it's great but the

70
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,110
situation is that it's either we change

71
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,570
or the studies are saying that if

72
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,879
company will no longer be viable so what

73
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,119
should we do we have to change

74
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,369
and the good thing is that we know how I

75
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,959
have to change but not only from the

76
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:57,020
technological viewpoint everything

77
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:59,149
starts with the change in attitude or

78
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,149
mindset it's not about calling this

79
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:04,639
company for them to come into the job

80
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:07,129
for us but this is about talent and

81
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,729
in-house talent it's about changing the

82
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:13,159
way we think it's no longer an office

83
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:15,378
gripping past that I that I can move on

84
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:17,360
we have to have an end-to-end automation

85
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,879
and the architecture process have to

86
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,969
follow them ups paradigms where you

87
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:27,259
integrate the tests and so there's it's

88
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:30,379
a whole round approach and we have to

89
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:33,039
reuse code let's stop doing the same

90
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:36,139
thing over and over and all of that

91
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,080
through API we have to abstract the

92
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,639
complexity in the backend and be able to

93
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,279
provide information for our customers in

94
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:49,099
the best possible way and all of that

95
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:53,300
working in communities because the model

96
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:57,919
of I do the job and you use it doesn't

97
00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,289
work we have to work together so the

98
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,469
change is also based on a technological

99
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:06,110
change we're building the other platform

100
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:08,629
that as we say here is a global banking

101
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,899
platform which allows developers to

102
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:14,959
easily build deploy and operate banking

103
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:18,050
devices of any kind of leverage in the

104
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:21,619
Virgin cloud so and there is a trough

105
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,449
platform because we used to do an

106
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:26,119
architecture in one of the countries and

107
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:29,599
then we would fit that architecture to

108
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:33,349
the next country and the best we called

109
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:35,779
it but that doesn't work what do we have

110
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:40,429
now we have a hybrid cloud to be able to

111
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:43,459
balance our workload based on public or

112
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:45,438
a private child according to cost and as

113
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:49,790
we've said it has to be automated as

114
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:57,760
well we do not want black boxes we want

115
00:06:49,790 --> 00:07:01,670
use the open source a working model and

116
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,610
the customer is the developer and

117
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:07,190
finally we have to decouple the business

118
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,870
our architecture to build the business

119
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:13,180
logic from the architectures to be able

120
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:16,310
to change in a faster and more agile way

121
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:20,120
so from the viewpoint of security what

122
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,930
are we facing - I love this slide

123
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:27,650
because I think it conveys very

124
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:30,650
truthfully my day today we have very

125
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,530
metal the operating system we have the

126
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,979
infrastructure than the operating system

127
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:39,710
then a platformer saying hey I'm going

128
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,630
intervention front I am the security

129
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,010
layer it's crazy

130
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:47,600
our job is crazy but it's a lot of fun

131
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:50,170
that's my view of it because in all of

132
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,640
these layers we also have diversity

133
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,040
technologies and I believe that the

134
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,050
challenge is fascinating I don't know if

135
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,150
many of you find ourselves in this

136
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,200
situation but for me it's a it's a

137
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:06,340
beautiful challenge so how are we facing

138
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:10,450
this BBVA from the viewpoint of security

139
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:14,750
one of the main components that we have

140
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:21,530
its seekers last year it was mentioned

141
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:25,820
so I want is to have security and better

142
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:28,299
and offering it as a service but what do

143
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,620
we really have from the viewpoint of

144
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:35,260
secure development

145
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:39,169
working with an airstone I was saying

146
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,510
the big change what we need is for

147
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,309
people to be informed of what is it that

148
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,050
they have to do because people don't do

149
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:48,189
things wrong because they enjoy doing it

150
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,719
they don't think it don't make things

151
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,400
insecure because they enjoy doing that

152
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,270
their problem is that we do not give

153
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:00,170
them deleted information and when we

154
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:06,650
give it to them late because it's the

155
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:10,339
developers have to production and in the

156
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:13,610
last step they security tells them they

157
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,310
cannot they cannot use that so we have

158
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,690
to they need to have that information

159
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:21,229
earlier they will have a better life and

160
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:24,410
we will work better and this is not

161
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,830
about our technologies but it's about a

162
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:31,579
hurried value to the selected tools and

163
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:40,790
finally security also must be as a

164
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:44,230
service ok as javi was saying what we

165
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:47,230
want to do from sega's our goal was to

166
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,230
meet

167
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:56,240
all our goals to be automated and

168
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,520
easy-to-use and to focus on developers

169
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,400
and to facilitate the integration of

170
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,520
security in their job that's where we

171
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:08,180
start it's important to take something

172
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,000
else into account to develop good

173
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:15,079
software should allow us to be very fast

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,630
and have a lot of quality because it

175
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,240
allows us to change when the business

176
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,730
changes and develop new things first way

177
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,030
we need to do that as a bank because of

178
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,460
the context that hobby has described and

179
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:35,020
the quality the better they code in

180
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:38,060
terms of easier it will be to maintain

181
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:57,260
focus on the real context that we're

182
00:10:38,060 --> 00:11:01,189
talking about 12-thousand developers in

183
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:05,990
vba working on a common a cloud age so

184
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:08,540
it's a huge challenge so we move at this

185
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:19,940
developers of speed we try to make

186
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:23,959
things fast so we and we stop things

187
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:27,880
that cannot be accepted or we pick up

188
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:30,590
their speed and move the way they do so

189
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,830
that's what we mean when we say shift

190
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:36,290
left as in intervening earlier in the

191
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:41,570
process if we're going to work with the

192
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:45,620
developers are going to be using cloud

193
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,780
platforms are doing fast releases so we

194
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,850
are not the first ones who face up to

195
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,399
this problem what's in the market

196
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,129
I saw the first thing with it was to

197
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,399
take a look at that and we came across

198
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:01,669
many interesting projects and terms we

199
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,679
particularly like this one they all was

200
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:08,249
which was an object upline important

201
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:10,259
that I will explain later on called

202
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:12,929
deficit cops which is about from

203
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,509
security people who have stumbled upon

204
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:17,879
the same block and they said we cannot

205
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:22,879
keep doing security in the same way but

206
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:26,850
it has to be security that delivered us

207
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,919
code we have to be the code and to make

208
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,720
sure that developers have security in

209
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,489
their day-to-day activities and as we

210
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,499
were working other initiatives came up

211
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:37,709
such as professor which is a Google

212
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:40,859
initiative which basically is an

213
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:42,748
metadata API because they said it

214
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:48,989
doesn't make sense that all products and

215
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:50,639
security solutions representatives the

216
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:54,329
way they want we have to standardize

217
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,249
this information beyond the existing

218
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:57,689
standards already and we are

219
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,819
participating with them in this

220
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:03,799
initiative because we believe it is

221
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:03,799
interesting to share that experience

222
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:23,290
we go quickly about what and they always

223
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:27,040
find what they propose to us they talk

224
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:30,250
about a security pipeline that means at

225
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,160
some point of your development cycle or

226
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:38,380
in the pileup stops you generate a new

227
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:48,010
security pipeline and the first phase of

228
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:49,390
the application and then we run a

229
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,360
battery of tests

230
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,610
static cold black box and with

231
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,900
information to generate from those tests

232
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:02,350
you generate actions remedial actions

233
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:08,980
risk actions risk management reporting

234
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:12,580
that sort of thing but if we go back to

235
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,530
our context we said okay that's all very

236
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,740
interesting this always proposal how do

237
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:21,400
we apply this and we have three options

238
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,680
once more as a security architecture we

239
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:31,600
gave them a catalogue of tools and tools

240
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:34,300
and lots of scripts etc but for 12,000

241
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:40,690
developers try and we try to manage that

242
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:45,670
or to help them do this we try to

243
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:48,310
develop simple easy to use product and I

244
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:54,069
like Apple in that way because they give

245
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:56,920
you a product that naive users and

246
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:10,390
expert users can use it really standard

247
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:14,079
is very easy to tries to solve the

248
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:16,360
situation and within to be able to solve

249
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:21,880
the points that we have given ourselves

250
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:24,730
there a security architecture liebherr

251
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:39,850
services that developers can use in a

252
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:47,290
simple way simple way possible simple

253
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:50,170
way for them usable by the security area

254
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,290
because he a code review that the

255
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:56,010
developer can do is the same code review

256
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:59,189
that is going to be done by the security

257
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:03,189
department what they act as as policeman

258
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:05,290
to make sure that something works so

259
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,960
that's the first goal really do have

260
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:12,400
those two from mines developers and

261
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:14,560
security the second goal they can they

262
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,840
always metaphor to have a number of

263
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:24,119
services of each one of the parts of the

264
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:24,120
DevOps cycle from the tree F the testing

265
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:31,420
delivery of security teams in the bank

266
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,120
and an automatic provision and for

267
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,829
security this in an automatic way we

268
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,770
wanted to be transparent for the

269
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:42,010
developer easy to use but that we do not

270
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:46,240
depend on having to crawl in terms of

271
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:48,010
people of staff because that's not so

272
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,800
what was the proposal in terms of

273
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:57,160
product we have three goals here

274
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:00,910
abstraction of security solution that

275
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,860
can be used many were developed for this

276
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,220
world and some not but even the ones

277
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:10,209
that were thought out for for this world

278
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:13,480
review of docker images Eclair we stock

279
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:17,040
in aqua some are open source and some

280
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,849
are from vendors that we do not want to

281
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:25,149
stick up to just one because in the

282
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:27,069
future if delivers more value that we

283
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:33,340
can change that and that is transpired

284
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:35,409
for the developers so so we use them

285
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:40,659
when they are useful we

286
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:43,060
game time and we test this functionality

287
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,940
and our intern our customers are

288
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,740
developers they only know I know that

289
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,320
there's an API where they can ask for

290
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:53,290
every view of the docker images and

291
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:58,270
chimera will phone always in the same

292
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:58,840
way and if I change Claire with by

293
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,960
twistlock

294
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,909
or aqua they won't even notice and I can

295
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,200
actually pick and choose from the three

296
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:11,680
it does add value many of the solutions

297
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,420
have very interesting solutions for

298
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,790
instance twist lock is very good for

299
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,190
containers but not so much for images a

300
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,690
lot of there's not so much focus on

301
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,290
images and there are some shortcomings

302
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:28,920
oh we improved what we look gave us we

303
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:30,760
standardized that and we added value

304
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,950
bringing information from different

305
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,990
layers that sort of thing and the best

306
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,200
thing is the orchestration part and in

307
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:43,570
that part for instance choosing between

308
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:50,860
these solution which is a branch of

309
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:54,250
feature you can use Claire I provide an

310
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:58,419
automatic feedback and there's a

311
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,980
functionality that will function with

312
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,070
the color function that I might do a

313
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,080
more thorough test or I add policies to

314
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,780
provide information to the developers as

315
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,770
to whether that part once it's gone

316
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:14,770
through audit is going to be deployable

317
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:17,290
in a platform so three points one

318
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,980
solution abstraction add value and

319
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,980
orchestration

320
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:27,470
to a large extent this new model of

321
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,480
chimera we've been working on for them

322
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,580
six eight months trying to deliver each

323
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,250
and every one of these services and in

324
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,770
the six months we've achieved what we

325
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:42,320
show here we have one abstraction layer

326
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:45,650
we have two available services to

327
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:50,270
further developers and we are finishing

328
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:52,520
up the third one we have these tools are

329
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,980
very integrated some are more mature

330
00:19:52,520 --> 00:20:00,320
some are less mature some we're still

331
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:02,419
testing so you have to keep in mind that

332
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,399
we're talking about 12,000 developers

333
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:06,320
each time they call I realized that in

334
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,289
hash those collide well it has to run

335
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,289
well that beyond that because in BBN who

336
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:16,520
are working as a large team we even have

337
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:18,549
developers from lab that we are thinking

338
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,460
of integrated infinity mirror because

339
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:25,820
that was a software to analyze the

340
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:28,100
penalties yeah to look for

341
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,230
vulnerabilities in these things that was

342
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,480
quite interesting our aim isn't with the

343
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,820
same philosophy we deliver dr. Chimaera

344
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:40,780
and given the same architecture area

345
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:43,580
we've done in chimera so we not only yes

346
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,559
fine things we're also trying to avail

347
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,090
the time and talent we have by doing

348
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,090
additional things okay

349
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:56,419
so regarding explaining how we direct in

350
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:06,740
detail I like to explain how we do it

351
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:09,820
what were we doing for the image so we

352
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:12,830
have a API and from your pipeline

353
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:18,590
manually from the Chimaera front front

354
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:22,550
end or from from any method you call us

355
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:24,770
and you ask us to review a docker image

356
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:28,970
here is a detail so what do we do in

357
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:31,070
Chimaera we tell twist hop twist lock

358
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,890
hey give me the information but they

359
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,530
were abilities of these two she's loved

360
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:40,490
groups for that in the registry here the

361
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,990
registry he set up with artifactory and

362
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,680
i'm reviewing this information because

363
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:48,580
it's quite important and we have two

364
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,050
options either we apply this information

365
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:55,580
to develop and they can seep down the

366
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:58,129
pipeline or we may use it on the commute

367
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,659
coming so many other place when they

368
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,550
won't share information so we try to

369
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,800
make this easy for developers because we

370
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:08,810
have different maturity levels in the

371
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:11,960
bank among the 12,000 developers we have

372
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:14,179
will have different levels so they're

373
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,490
obviously beginners in some markets

374
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:21,080
people who are beginning to do 40

375
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,670
Jenkins you transfer the image

376
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:28,780
parameters and without they do all the

377
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,780
magic of Colin Chimaera

378
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:37,200
the return and the Valois library to

379
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:39,570
make developers lives easier and here

380
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,220
they're different libraries simple to

381
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:49,260
use is library equipment the team is

382
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:54,470
really functions they use ours so the

383
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,470
end using commercial be very easy

384
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,360
does my thinking well for for the other

385
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,040
feedback the Harvey was mentioning so

386
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:06,719
you know that if you're gonna use an

387
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,520
image as $226 abilities using barley and

388
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,040
you need to corrupt it and will command

389
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,490
as a developer you may choose not to do

390
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,980
it

391
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,890
what's the thing here when you deploy

392
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,710
our imaging search environment that's

393
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,800
gonna be rejected so what do we do here

394
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:26,940
to the value above twistlock we give

395
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:30,120
information how that image should be

396
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:33,620
assessed is gonna be flattened and you

397
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,419
may deploy it in one or other

398
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,370
environment and we say it simply and we

399
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,830
say we cannot deploy it because the

400
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:43,809
policy says you need

401
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,789
you have many more so mentally simple

402
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:50,080
info please advise you maybe charity

403
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:51,220
Chimaera in your pipeline because we put

404
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,750
everything on Jason we need this

405
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,899
information you may also see the heart

406
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:59,880
on the other console that's how he

407
00:23:55,899 --> 00:24:02,320
mentioned earlier the Emma Vetter is for

408
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,120
vocalist use it as a thing they've gone

409
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,918
solo with all the information and this

410
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,649
is nice you can be choked there give

411
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,340
their hand we have security what do you

412
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:11,799
do here

413
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,908
we have a city guy checking every image

414
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:17,590
that he's is comment every so often well

415
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:19,899
we don't do that we try to have her to

416
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:22,240
make it a person sees we don't need to

417
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:26,580
hire so many security teams for that

418
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,580
with you automatically

419
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,550
even our hardest and pug images saying

420
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,870
has been reviewed he's got this

421
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:41,960
information and these are the

422
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:46,370
recommendations environment the platform

423
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:56,540
this is deployed automatically she'll

424
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:59,179
validate those properties and know we're

425
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,860
using a function of our country because

426
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,140
we can actually our properties of the

427
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,270
artifacts they call the properties and

428
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,580
that's a metadata associated to the

429
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:12,040
aunty family what are we doing here that

430
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:17,139
security seal we're using any token job

431
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,139
that's adjacent for my token design

432
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,550
eventually

433
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:45,210
okay okay okay well the good thing about

434
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:48,330
this is they came up with this

435
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,800
the team the rest of our colleagues not

436
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:56,129
something we fall off in tonight we'll

437
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:59,159
talk to project very well aligned how we

438
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,140
do transfer on the Google people how so

439
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,260
they called annotations in the goofiest

440
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:08,580
project to sign the metadata that is

441
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:20,070
been left in that stop it was very

442
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:25,110
interesting can you do that yes subject

443
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:26,820
in the job is associated deal image of

444
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,419
the doctor which is a shamless in charge

445
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:34,169
so we know the image we review that

446
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:43,080
chart is the one that is deployed and

447
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:45,720
the deployment platform services and

448
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,350
that's try to do a live demo I think we

449
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,350
have a bit of time

450
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:58,929
otherwise we'll just play the video be

451
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:58,930
plumb so

452
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,730
or get that long

453
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:31,120
Kodomo connects your own butter so I

454
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:33,480
think we're connected wait so I'm gonna

455
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,479
show

456
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,679
how the API launch would happen via

457
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,680
Chimaera

458
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,220
okay

459
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,629
so first of all camellias authenticated

460
00:28:54,790 --> 00:29:00,340
first Fanta Kate to call the API

461
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,629
what do we send Chimaera we have the

462
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:12,070
concept of projects and we have projects

463
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:15,189
to reach team and functionality the

464
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:18,129
consul's does this need to be associated

465
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:20,289
something particular now when you

466
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:21,849
identify you know is something yours and

467
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:23,289
what do we do this force but whenever

468
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:26,529
you leave information you should be

469
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:30,429
authorized to check it and see different

470
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:33,059
things on the front end so first of all

471
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:33,059
create the project

472
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:41,380
great has been created and without which

473
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,450
in the case of veterans we were saying

474
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,120
the actual console could you it's saying

475
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:50,260
there's a new project in the bank this

476
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,520
is it fire we know which one it is it's

477
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,540
a summer and these are the users

478
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:59,160
developers the our main and once we get

479
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,159
that information we know lives is

480
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:11,620
the developers simply send honeymooner

481
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:16,570
abilities requests we see the image the

482
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:19,500
project that reviews r32 and without my

483
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,500
even answer

484
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:26,710
try to show the bit better and he was

485
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:32,080
come this image wish of the sages

486
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:32,080
sometimes if there's a big load you

487
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:39,850
can't just jump trying to show you

488
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,850
something else

489
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:53,149
you know

490
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:59,740
level lies how this way that's what

491
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:59,740
happens when you have life okay

492
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,679
so there's nothing there it's kind of

493
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:15,559
the Scotch must use be launched even a

494
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,559
refresh and now it's on the fire

495
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:24,619
I know you see well resume me so we have

496
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,619
some damage to interfere

497
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:34,359
and from the front we may even company

498
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:41,839
expiry date and so on but the most

499
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:45,559
important thing is to see the report we

500
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,708
see the abilities policies we sort them

501
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,709
out

502
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,470
I may see how I'm doing eh environment

503
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:03,750
which medium

504
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:07,570
is it working there which one it isn't

505
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:12,090
you in the Cosmo just like just like to

506
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,090
the front and I see the report here

507
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:27,389
and we have the Foundation's in detail

508
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,520
of how many there are the amount of

509
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:32,760
abilities and their details

510
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,760
why because you can depict this any way

511
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,390
you want to the fears you want use this

512
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:43,950
information when you call this pipeline

513
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:46,200
either you have a maturity you may say

514
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,029
well yes we just wanted to even get

515
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,100
feedback you fast I'm not your team you

516
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:52,590
feel comfortable locking your pipeline

517
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:57,949
you can avail of these information and

518
00:32:52,590 --> 00:33:01,320
do that how we're doing timewise okay

519
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:03,770
right so another thing that we're trying

520
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,770
to do

521
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,710
is so trying to have it on the junkies

522
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,710
library

523
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:20,200
okay

524
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,700
right

525
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,800
just trying to work with his mouth

526
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,580
I think this is it

527
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,870
still having promised of the Marvel

528
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:15,580
assuming we see the library with the

529
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:19,418
parameters that we need we can see the

530
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:22,980
image name the ID and he may be where

531
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:22,980
everyone today young kids

532
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:43,918
and here it shows review this image

533
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:54,340
yeah hey my man the race Halloween whom

534
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:58,649
I also actually send semi image to be

535
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,649
reviewed that's right

536
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:14,279
well you know if the demo work well no

537
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:14,279
you just need to scan you'll be ready

538
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:26,130
and there's something important here

539
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:43,579
out of time it's not working pretty well

540
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:43,579
due to my house if you view this thumb

541
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:55,930
you can sit here on the Sun Visor

542
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:58,990
you see the nice results and eventually

543
00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:02,460
policy says it's open job with an

544
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,459
inspiring with expiry date

545
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:10,390
you need to leave much amount and which

546
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:13,210
clashes are they responsible

547
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:18,420
functionality to vote these on under

548
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:18,420
Jenkins to validate these lumps of code

549
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:24,520
so let me check whether I can see it

550
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:32,970
and basically it is a mini library where

551
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,590
a validated is done the answer which

552
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,339
environment I send the information of

553
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,340
who is it for

554
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:50,810
so there it shows whether it's good

555
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:56,630
which is not something that a soap a

556
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:59,210
given this here if I change any value

557
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,680
change

558
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,630
the environment does not be in

559
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,629
development but you'd be production

560
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,220
just now we cannot deliver it

561
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,780
it says it both falls

562
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:24,210
yes they are saying well that's politics

563
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,390
okay

564
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,560
the environment is KL because in

565
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:30,839
interaction you cannot flow down it

566
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,960
which is white you will eat it this time

567
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,760
but and the issue that it is okay so it

568
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,290
gives you all the functionality that it

569
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,520
can so the developers and platforms

570
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,850
we're gonna use this functionality can

571
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,850
do so

572
00:37:46,180 --> 00:38:34,149
important day for the secrets I

573
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:37,339
mentioned earlier there's nothing cool

574
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:44,349
secrets the guys hidden around here

575
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:44,349
we're trying to secrets

576
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:51,690
so that a lot is level we don't see

577
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,000
information that he's not repository so

578
00:38:51,690 --> 00:39:06,480
we have to leave information in each

579
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:10,190
stage of the development cycle it is not

580
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:14,580
saying not come this is more necessary

581
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:18,510
to work on this even for developers so

582
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:22,380
no chance out of time this is everything

583
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:28,200
we want to tell you about and we have a

584
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:31,040
long way different things things are not

585
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:35,060
the marketing you have any question or

586
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:38,730
suggestion please let us know thank you

587
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:45,650
Howie thank you

588
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:49,250
[Applause]

589
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,250
are there any questions

590
00:39:51,559 --> 00:40:04,339
a couple of questions here so let's be

591
00:39:56,689 --> 00:40:07,959
here closer hi in the future are you

592
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:11,538
gonna release this are you planning to

593
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:12,109
release it as open source well we love

594
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:14,689
to yourself

595
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:17,989
in fact lapses open source and the

596
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:19,729
traces in the breviary repository for

597
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:21,949
Chimaera when you talk to the legal area

598
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:24,558
of the bank well we have an open source

599
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:27,019
philosophy we work for a month that is

600
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:30,319
something I'm gonna change so we need to

601
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:35,558
go through maturity stages but our right

602
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:38,808
is to do something though my beliefs

603
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:40,249
even doing advertisement the guys from

604
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:42,579
the team have availed of their knowledge

605
00:40:40,249 --> 00:40:47,448
and we have number interests and things

606
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:49,400
even in BVI some personal people are

607
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:51,979
availing of the innocent we're trying to

608
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,779
create open source sewers we have this

609
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:56,919
good you know that there's some

610
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:56,920
interesting in this

611
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:03,560
hi

612
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:05,890
first of all congratulations the tool is

613
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,150
very interesting I really like it

614
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,740
I'd like to ask about the false

615
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:12,170
positives in my experience with these

616
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,450
tools they relieves those for false

617
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:17,570
positives and how do you manage this in

618
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:21,319
Chimaera well regarding from shorting

619
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:26,600
chimaera right now we have the

620
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:28,550
possibility salmi you haven't yet to

621
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:36,950
find the role that means to do it by the

622
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:39,970
governance we really have functionality

623
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:42,220
of marking that these are false positive

624
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:47,029
regarding the chlorophyll Chimaera

625
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:49,569
ideally in the first stage for feedback

626
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,570
and so on

627
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:56,460
the developer has a certainty of wool is

628
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:59,400
a false positive and then a bank level

629
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:03,690
we have the dog team which is a user of

630
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:09,049
the tool you as the security team will

631
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:11,790
define those rules and they'll be tabled

632
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:16,650
to work with the ethical hopping and the

633
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:22,020
Securities in this process this is

634
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:25,290
automated in fact that's the other big

635
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:28,049
sign of my security inclined my security

636
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:31,710
team is whenever they get these products

637
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:37,530
to validate it your way to review all

638
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:39,340
the false positives they do it with us

639
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:43,000
phew

640
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:46,990
it was as possible so they may focus on

641
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,320
reviewing one of things that maybe the

642
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:53,020
software even though I deliver to give

643
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,750
me around the reviews but having done a

644
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,490
project how it evolved and how the

645
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,340
amount of vulnerabilities of a certain

646
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:02,109
power decreased so they may focus on

647
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,780
those things so that we may have a

648
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:08,110
history of the product even analytics

649
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:10,060
because we have it as MVP one of the

650
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:12,250
things we like to do is that we know

651
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:15,790
these projects are certain statistics

652
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:19,920
because it's recurrent regarding the

653
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,920
amount of tons that we get library

654
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:29,078
we've used that lager has been taken out

655
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:32,348
so we just want to simplify the final

656
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:34,059
security teams work we have until you

657
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:36,369
feedback to the developers to make

658
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:39,519
things simpler and also to scale the

659
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:44,199
security teams it's just impossible Mary

660
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:47,169
speaking just like this you GT Jews okay

661
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:49,359
for 12,000 12,000 developers so Dom your

662
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:52,209
team should be able to be much more
