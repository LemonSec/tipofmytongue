1
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:25,719
buenas kettle muchas gracias por serpent

2
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:27,520
Oh Alice for being so punctual you know

3
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,399
that it is very difficult sometimes to

4
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,298
have eat here to eat at this place at

5
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:38,409
Annapolis which is well is cinema

6
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:41,110
theater all right so he happy he's not

7
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:45,039
known to us at Rudy's not at all he's

8
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:48,009
very well known to us Xavier and avi

9
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:52,030
they come from that logic well the rule

10
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:54,819
that we set out for fruited conference

11
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:58,509
is that the techniques oh sorry

12
00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:02,500
present I just have to be technical in

13
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:07,420
nature but because well now it is up to

14
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,848
you to introduce yourselves okay well as

15
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,450
you can see the title of the

16
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:14,700
presentation is again you again -

17
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,369
marriage

18
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,069
so you've seen okay okay we have to add

19
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,750
it okay this question mark in front of

20
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:25,149
the statement this is what we do in

21
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,459
proper Spanish okay so my name is Javier

22
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,299
Rodriguez I am the responsible for the

23
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:36,120
Department of Ecology security I've been

24
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:36,120
doing that since 2017

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,460
so I also fix washing machines which is

26
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:47,540
also important piece of information and

27
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:50,210
then I come from what is email from law

28
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,640
enforcement agency my name is Samuel

29
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,590
Sanchez I've been working the cyber

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,540
security department of turn logic for

31
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,860
two years now item 6 washing machines

32
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,859
but I also do all the type of things

33
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,910
so what he does is not illegal at all is

34
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:11,519
fully legal so and we are that logic we

35
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,700
don't do anything illegal so what is our

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,970
presentation about well this

37
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,070
presentation is not very usual so I've

38
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,200
been working as a civilian for 13 months

39
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:27,600
that I've been seeing lots of reports

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,640
from experts so when they take a sample

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,310
and then they put the blame on the

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,760
Russians okay so this man must be like

43
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,880
really really busy with so much

44
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,459
accountability when you put on TV then

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,769
it's everything talks about putting here

46
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:48,000
and there everywhere but sometimes we

47
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:50,340
tend to focus about two things first of

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,430
all there are other actors other players

49
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,850
than Russia or other strategic players

50
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,580
and there are also other people doing

51
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,799
manwë to gain intelligence and then

52
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,630
attributions we are interested in

53
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,640
finding out about the distribution and

54
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,410
to tell you more about how attribution

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,239
is being made and then cyber

56
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,770
intelligence hopefully we'll have some

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,560
time to refer to it at the end of the

58
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,150
presentation so I'm also very important

59
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,519
was something important before we start

60
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,850
when people ask me what about well this

61
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,770
change of life of the Egyptians your

62
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,590
life dramatically when I come from the

63
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,740
Marathi wheel so I've been working with

64
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,950
this man for six to seven years he is

65
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,140
one of my career references and he was

66
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,909
also all the time telling me ok to not

67
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,820
get in to travel to not get into trouble

68
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,520
so this is my first day on tour logic

69
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,770
there were minions everywhere shooting

70
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,900
arrows at me but the change was a bit

71
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,570
like that but then the one said look you

72
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:54,359
have infiltrated yourself what is it

73
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:57,240
like to be infiltrated inter logic well

74
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,830
basically after doing some research this

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:05,010
is what but I eat what I drink and then

76
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,280
this is a pictogram ok

77
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:12,060
now going back to the topic as I was

78
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,119
saying we will be studying or analyzing

79
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,580
formal words which are quite trendy they

80
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,580
come with reports carried out by a

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,830
number of researchers what we did was

82
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,680
just to take those samples some of those

83
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,469
samples were difficult for us to find we

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,750
found them we gotten and then we analyze

85
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,660
them second part will be analyzing the

86
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:39,570
techniques and tactics and procedures

87
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:43,530
used to communicate the infection so my

88
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:46,190
colleague David will start and then I

89
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,190
will take over

90
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:57,549
careful with what you say well are you

91
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,550
censoring me

92
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,430
well

93
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,210
so this work is not only my work it is

94
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:12,510
the work of the reversing team at that

95
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,299
logic the team is made up of many people

96
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:19,650
if you have doubts about it talk about

97
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:25,040
mastery consular Diego well this is a

98
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,039
work of all of us however I've been

99
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,690
appointed are going to be the

100
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,550
spokesperson so I will tell you about

101
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,070
the characteristics of the man well I

102
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:39,990
will tell you about the impact of it the

103
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:43,950
objectives of it and to whom it is and

104
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:46,950
tributed so we will be analyzing bills

105
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:51,050
and ransom as well as IP t's because I

106
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:55,560
told it and also that this was a bit of

107
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,600
general sensation ok so ok that's why if

108
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,910
you want to decrypt it you have to pay

109
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,990
for it and then the definition of

110
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:07,770
Wikipedia of apt it is a very lengthy

111
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,300
very most definition basically we can

112
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:13,229
summarize it by following this is a

113
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,770
month where we set objective with the

114
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:21,210
data infiltration surveillance panache

115
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:24,030
profit it lasts over time well perhaps

116
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,560
it doesn't persist over time we will

117
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:30,200
take a look at our and it is often

118
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:36,920
distributed by an organization we have

119
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,920
selected for malware very different

120
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,330
but from each other okay the first one

121
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,270
is run a cry well many of you are aware

122
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,270
of each others may have also suffered it

123
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:57,539
it is a ransomware that was discovered

124
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:07,080
nazia in May the first patient patient

125
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:10,530
zero was exactly 24 hours after the

126
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,460
release of the exploits of the thermal

127
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:19,940
glue 24 hours later the first attacks

128
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:23,940
were being noticed in major companies in

129
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:27,300
Spain and in Europe and impact was

130
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:30,240
global impacts all this magua we

131
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,120
analyzed the math and logic and we drew

132
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:38,549
withdrawn our conclusions so we got a

133
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:44,060
sample of when I cry we could see that a

134
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:46,640
new service was created it was

135
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:51,030
propagated through eternal blue

136
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,810
vulnerability it came in with an zipped

137
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:57,260
file that we managed to unzip because it

138
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,880
always used the same encryption key and

139
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,550
then what we could see in there the

140
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,800
typical thing that you find in ransom

141
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:11,400
RTF files with different type of texts

142
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:15,439
from users what to do to decrypt epc and

143
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,910
then antonio told us that you had

144
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,360
straightforward address to command

145
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:24,240
control dashboard and then we also found

146
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,270
the wallets of Bitcoin when the person

147
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,770
was asked to deposit money to decrypt

148
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:35,730
the PC the vector forum of infection was

149
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:38,910
eternal blue a tool it was open source

150
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:42,360
because it was made published it was not

151
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:45,510
restricted it was not a paid tool and

152
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,410
then eternal blue who was embarrassed in

153
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,280
the binary code and they also just

154
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,550
doubled pulsar

155
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:58,140
so impact was global we all whatever

156
00:09:53,550 --> 00:10:00,359
fear it was very much in the news

157
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:04,740
hunting attributions of this man well

158
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,050
according to Karl passkey where people

159
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,030
that had a good commands of Chinese and

160
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:13,290
English and all English language and

161
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:17,040
were performing or behaving similarly to

162
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,599
Lazarus group so it has been activities

163
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,390
of Lazarus could have been attributed to

164
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:26,580
a group in North Korea to code 2.0 2.0 I

165
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,380
don't know whether you are aware of it

166
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:32,850
it is believed to be one of the most

167
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:36,390
sophisticated ABT's ever do good to is

168
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:38,220
an apt that was discovered in 2015 what

169
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:43,800
is covered by Kaspersky because it was

170
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:45,000
one of the victims was apparently they

171
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,400
said that the first sample was

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,420
discovered in 2011 and that these their

173
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,939
compassion comes from 2014 personally it

174
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,250
was very difficult for us to get a

175
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,130
sample and actually we didn't get it in

176
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,140
the end but what we got were several

177
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,800
modules and plugins that could be added

178
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:08,330
to the apt so it was distributed as an

179
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,910
SMI MSI package which is a way to

180
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:15,720
install remote packages and services all

181
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:21,060
the names have been obfuscated with sort

182
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:23,630
he of 32 bits it used several types of

183
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,949
encryptions we had its own algorithms

184
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,250
encryption algorithms that it was very

185
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:32,700
difficult to get like a clear conclusion

186
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:35,280
it came in with various signatures in

187
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,230
the binary was very difficult for us to

188
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,350
get information out of it

189
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,480
so this

190
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,990
to encryption algorithms that we found

191
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,550
Camellia and another one because it was

192
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,750
very difficult to get information from

193
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:53,229
this manhwa so we looked at the papers

194
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:58,120
published by Kaspersky which was one of

195
00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:00,460
the impacted firms and we could see that

196
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,540
it was actually very sophisticated was

197
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:08,650
very complex it was very difficult first

198
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,480
of all to detect and then to get

199
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:14,560
information out of it it increments in

200
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:18,460
3-0 days that were discovered through

201
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,520
the apt he was signed with certificate

202
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:24,760
stolen from Foxconn did see said Chinese

203
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,040
hardware manufacturer it was a hard

204
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,560
certificate satellite of a ferry sign

205
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,829
that it was certificate was a stolen and

206
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,709
just to send this apt so more than 100

207
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:38,410
plugins having discovered up until to

208
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:42,580
date and we believe that there are other

209
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:44,560
classes plugins yet to be discovered and

210
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,080
because an abt let us talk about

211
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,959
persistence participant interesting case

212
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,750
because persistence was quite difficult

213
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,360
to found to find because once you

214
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,790
restart the machine it disappears all

215
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,190
the traces in the machine about the apt

216
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:04,449
were eliminated as you switch off

217
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:07,180
computer so it was installed through is

218
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,310
the drivers that it used to be installed

219
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,670
in the gateways and in the routers and

220
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:16,079
then it went back to infecting the

221
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:19,439
machines and the way that it used to

222
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:25,840
exfiltrate information was about through

223
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:28,360
GP gps oak give images with encrypted

224
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,320
information so it was very difficult to

225
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:37,690
find suspicious traffic in the network

226
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:40,770
impact was the following below hundred

227
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:44,500
teams one of the serial patience was

228
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,150
hospice Kaspersky PAP until one of the

229
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,450
top managers was infected through a

230
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:52,720
spear phishing attack and other victims

231
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:55,740
of the magua event Li were the members

232
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:01,210
of nuclear irony

233
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:03,490
Island nuclear conference appearances

234
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,040
some of the participants were infected

235
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,100
with this apt attribution according to

236
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:14,650
color Spassky was difficult because in

237
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:17,640
the apt we found wrong flags they were

238
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,640
signed by

239
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:28,400
misnomers with misnomers he only

240
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:39,020
attacked sometimes and not other days it

241
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:40,959
did not it was inactive on Fridays no

242
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,860
locks on Fridays and no activity on

243
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:49,670
Saturday it was considered to be the

244
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:53,480
half-brother of Stuxnet because it was

245
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:59,719
quite similar to Stuxnet okay let us go

246
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:02,330
back now now let us prefer to petia and

247
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,030
not petia it is has been classified as a

248
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,890
ransomware we are not fully sure about

249
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,240
it it was discovered last year and it

250
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:12,949
was his religious through met doc

251
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:18,080
medical management software primarily

252
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:21,530
Justin to crania so that somewhere it is

253
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,040
executed through one DLL 30 to one city

254
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:27,770
is run in the memory it deletes itself

255
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,170
and then it has the number of zeros in

256
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:33,680
the

257
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:36,560
memory does not use and e0j doesn't have

258
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,109
any certificate no nothing and then it

259
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,719
steals credentials Ruth mimic has

260
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,840
another two so therefore this is more

261
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,990
than ransomware well by stealing a

262
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,670
credential awesome credentials Estonian

263
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,320
what used to distribute itself through

264
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,660
the network ok the procedure is our

265
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:57,500
following i infect your team i modified

266
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,990
MBR i first restart and then I simulate

267
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,490
that I am checking the disk but the only

268
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,340
thing that I'm doing I'm just like

269
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:08,720
encrypting all your files I am

270
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:12,380
generating an encryption certificate and

271
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,730
then I encrypted through salsa 20 what

272
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:20,390
is the difference between no petia and

273
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:24,950
random man apply well I encrypted and if

274
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:28,520
you give me a ransom good but you will

275
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:32,240
never ever be able to decrypt it even if

276
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:38,689
I give you a key to do that well main

277
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:41,440
impact was found in do crania well even

278
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,440
in Ukraine

279
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:51,269
more machines were affected and in the

280
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:56,250
US so huge tremendous impacts in Ukraine

281
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:59,690
some attribution so the website of the

282
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:02,690
White House couple of weeks ago

283
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,690
attributed

284
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:10,370
this attack to the Russian military and

285
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,020
now let us move on to a different apt

286
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:15,829
Babar I don't know whether you're aware

287
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,569
of it it had a direct impact on some of

288
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:23,720
the Spanish companies it was discovered

289
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:26,689
in 2015 it was Snowden through WikiLeaks

290
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:32,660
cable mention say to us having produced

291
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:37,610
him back in 2009 it is more it's simpler

292
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:41,000
du couteau it is encrypted through a yes

293
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:43,429
and then in the config file we got the

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,270
key and the offset that were stored in

295
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:50,030
the payload so there we could see the

296
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,010
programs he interacted with and the

297
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,770
commander control pages he interacted

298
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,530
with if we take a quick look at it we

299
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,889
may see that the applications

300
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:03,020
applications for job view document

301
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,510
management messaging and video

302
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,639
conferencing the objective is smooth and

303
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:11,150
clear intercepting communication and

304
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:15,460
sent them out objectives targets were

305
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:19,390
companies in Africa Canada and Spain

306
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:25,210
interesting information about in this

307
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:25,210
name he comes from French cartoon

308
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:34,850
debug mode was activated and there were

309
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:37,730
many messages making a reference to

310
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:42,678
French acronyms and to the French

311
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:46,519
cartoon and that's why attribution was

312
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:49,779
given to Animal Farm group that had we

313
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:55,269
had developed a number of diabetes in

314
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:55,269
similar manner to summarize

315
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,709
so even you have to run some words and

316
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:08,200
to ABT's they are very much different

317
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:13,429
from each other both in terms of the

318
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:15,950
difficulty of the code and also

319
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:19,940
different in terms of the infrastructure

320
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:23,419
needed by them so there is a difference

321
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,080
between infecting a team through a

322
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,529
several-day

323
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,899
all through and known exploits so to

324
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:31,639
summarize if you want to develop Magua

325
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:34,189
we have to think about a team of

326
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:38,019
developers who've seen that there are

327
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:42,619
different people involved in the process

328
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:45,049
in some of the debugging messages we

329
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:47,299
could easily see that they were

330
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,249
breathing in different languages in the

331
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:52,429
car so therefore we will also need

332
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:55,669
development resources with encryption

333
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:59,149
mechanisms summer owns or others then if

334
00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:01,789
we need every certificate we also have

335
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:03,289
to see whether we want to make that

336
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:05,299
certificate of ourselves without being

337
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:09,109
suspicious we also need infrastructure

338
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:11,899
commander control servers wallets BTC

339
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:14,090
and then a way to distribute it once we

340
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:16,309
have our objective the reset difference

341
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:19,009
between this routing it through exploits

342
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:21,649
several days of fishing events and as a

343
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:25,070
result by having out with takeover and

344
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:27,768
sent you more about this complexity and

345
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:31,119
these all these differences that we

346
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,119
found well

347
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,520
now at this point

348
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:45,530
so we have to be aware that we Manuel is

349
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,290
diverse in terms of complexity it also

350
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,180
provides a specific infrastructure so it

351
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,180
requires specific deployments or

352
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:56,960
Truelove's and then who or what defines

353
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:59,330
its developments and deployments so we

354
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,830
always put the blame on Russia but this

355
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,970
is not always the case they are not the

356
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,030
one and only actor

357
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,770
okay let us abstract ourselves a bit so

358
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:11,000
have you ever questioned who asked

359
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:13,700
yourselves why do you define who makes

360
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,980
that mal well why do Marvel is like that

361
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,410
and not differently how are the same

362
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,230
spots what do you have to do so that you

363
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,850
are not caught there are a number of

364
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,340
strategic issues that you have to bypass

365
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,860
are not popular imaginary says the

366
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,959
following so one day the US president

367
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,270
wakes up and I say ok let us call and

368
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,270
they say and now I die due to infect a

369
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:37,639
half Europe for me please well in the

370
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:40,190
case of Russia this is much easier so

371
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,460
this is even personalized okay so to

372
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:46,430
Dean says okay let us I don't know let's

373
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,520
invade a premier and then there has to a

374
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:52,940
couple of ransomware

375
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,550
and Russia is to blame so in the Russian

376
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:59,150
case there is a significant duality here

377
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:01,280
because the Russian case is the cuts in

378
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,620
two different ways and this is very well

379
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,070
shown in

380
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:09,070
The Mummy the share was a person dancing

381
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:11,169
and then we also have another me with

382
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,330
pudding they're playing chess they all

383
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:16,059
have followed the muscles pose in

384
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,990
mathematics but the University of Moscow

385
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:21,580
they are perfect

386
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:24,850
okay look theses were putting Angeles

387
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:30,040
amenities all the manga in the world so

388
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:34,719
now if we continue to follow those ideas

389
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:37,750
and reports issued by AV companies I

390
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,730
said we all these access to these

391
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,350
procedural information is only done

392
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,900
through man well it seems that some

393
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,209
countries especially synderen are the

394
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,190
same countries who are doing their and

395
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,770
they obtain Secret Service tapes so

396
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,780
attributions what similar tribution

397
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:58,730
means that i know for sure that you've

398
00:22:52,780 --> 00:23:02,420
done that that's why it is some reports

399
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:07,730
her loans of lines but by partying do go

400
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:10,220
to to go to points at Israel so the

401
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:12,770
thing is that nowadays attribution says

402
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,940
okay yes ma'am were sample the language

403
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,629
infrastructure

404
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,110
well parting of treats dysentery at the

405
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:25,250
end of the day we are impacted by that

406
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:28,250
but see how this is done

407
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,780
okay so we have putting on Donald Trump

408
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,330
here what happens here

409
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:34,899
well the country has subjected needs

410
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:38,080
that wants to get an understanding about

411
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:41,390
so different countries have different

412
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,010
strategies and needs and they need

413
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,930
intelligence to make decisions for

414
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:48,170
instance government a monster finds out

415
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:52,040
what is government be doing in financial

416
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:55,910
issues so they design a intelligence

417
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:59,300
operation for that and now let us try to

418
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,740
come why Marwa exists this is very

419
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,610
important because if we know what

420
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:07,730
malware exists all the needs that barber

421
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:11,389
covers we could be more accurate you

422
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:13,580
know in attribution basically well these

423
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,330
parts of this presentation will be about

424
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,999
intelligence

425
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,359
so second bullet point is what what a

426
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:25,089
theory says this is about his closing

427
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:28,418
news able to change an already made

428
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:30,969
decision or a more to that we help you

429
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:32,469
make decisions therefore we say that is

430
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:35,759
this a product coming out of an

431
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:38,440
evaluation and an interpretation of the

432
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,200
information gathered by an intelligence

433
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,289
service so this comes from the manual

434
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,169
from the Army so let us imagine this

435
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:50,289
scenario cicada stunned entropies son

436
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:53,369
these are two border countries they are

437
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:57,609
in trouble they are quarreling they are

438
00:24:53,369 --> 00:25:03,238
arguing with each other because they are

439
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:06,199
having dispute they are fighting over

440
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:09,410
region that is

441
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,530
Costel father is changing government in

442
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:15,050
Pakistan a common man which is hostile

443
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,910
to the government of Chucky distant so

444
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:19,310
therefore we have a problem there is a

445
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,650
change of government then that

446
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,810
government is hostile and I have to make

447
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,670
a number of decisions that will have an

448
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,230
impact on my relationship with the

449
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,150
country therefore what will be my

450
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,820
strategy that's what everything you

451
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,560
started it starts it's being said that

452
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,179
there is a need of intelligence I have

453
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,830
to make a decision that I don't know how

454
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,820
to make that decision I didn't know what

455
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:43,490
to do well because the states country is

456
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,169
impacting the country says ok I have a

457
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,630
number of songs are can use could be

458
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,640
either my diplomatic channels my

459
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,930
relationship with an ally countries and

460
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,350
I also heard from the intelligence

461
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,700
community when he reported agreed that

462
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,590
this has been tested this has been

463
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,170
tested they are referring to the

464
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,060
intelligence community so what is an

465
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:05,990
intelligence community and the network I

466
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,850
am putting and I said well when the

467
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,760
community of intelligences I said our

468
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:13,969
bodies devoted to gathering and

469
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:17,570
producing intelligence well I'll give

470
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:20,690
you one in Spain we have the the

471
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:24,590
National Intelligence Center the Armed

472
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:28,370
Forces and sitcom contrary to the UK

473
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:31,459
government's doing either doing internal

474
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,919
external spying in Spain that is

475
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,070
organized by areas and the Cisco we have

476
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,380
what the Seville national police forces

477
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,879
they are dealing with terrorist issues

478
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,460
will

479
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,500
Analia maximally then we have the FIFA

480
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,390
from the unprocess I said well if

481
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,539
Department hasn't professor Goodwin end

482
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:55,600
up in the wall ok FIFA's handle such and

483
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:57,220
then CNA so does strategic intelligence

484
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,750
that is to say with an impact on

485
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:03,010
national security and this is the thing

486
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,890
works in Spain and then we have

487
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,650
operational agents operating agency

488
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,809
agents they are also part of this

489
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,240
intelligence team now why the community

490
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:15,970
of intelligence has to handle all that

491
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,070
well for a number of reasons because it

492
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,630
is good for everything and intelligence

493
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,970
service is good for everything it

494
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:26,080
impresses any odd thing you can think

495
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:32,830
about then it also has a kind of go blow

496
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:34,780
of official secrecy somewhat a little

497
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:39,129
service tells you that everything they

498
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:41,500
do is secret and then it also includes

499
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:46,780
viruses industry this is the most

500
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:49,299
powerful so the country has that is to

501
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:52,990
say a number of conflicts which are

502
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:55,450
nearly non-existent so therefore and

503
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:59,169
intelligence services just folder for

504
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:01,630
those nearly non-existent issues and

505
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:03,020
then it is also an actual reflection of

506
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,250
the capacities

507
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:08,870
Society of that country so people

508
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:12,680
believe that an intelligence service is

509
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:16,790
like what it looks like on the left but

510
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:20,510
actually it is like the right photograph

511
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:24,409
so it is a kind of papers so in Russia

512
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:26,720
things may be different but not here in

513
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:29,000
Russia it seems that everyone is a spy

514
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,370
well they are good at doing that because

515
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,300
they have a history for that now what

516
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,939
does state or reservists as well they

517
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:40,399
put together an intelligence operation I

518
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,460
said look I am in trouble I have this

519
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,640
problem let us see how I can get useful

520
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,770
information so that my boss which in

521
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,650
this case is prime minister of my

522
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:56,800
country can make a decision okay notice

523
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,800
these conditions well often

524
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:04,790
in the civil society but this does not

525
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:07,580
but but I wouldn't say that it doesn't

526
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:10,280
work but it is so complicated that it is

527
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,379
very difficult to follow well in these

528
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,570
last 30 months I found very strange

529
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,450
things ok let us think about and now

530
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,790
there is focus about how I gather that

531
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,770
information that in seconds imagine that

532
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,300
I am the head of the community of

533
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,820
intelligence and I bring together my

534
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:28,159
team everyone said look this morning

535
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,899
putting her up and that he wants us to

536
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,280
get information about this case then

537
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,220
they activate the sources of information

538
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,830
and then those of us who are working on

539
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,110
that we start to get lost ok because

540
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,500
there is not a technical way to gather

541
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:44,389
information it is well we you may

542
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,820
obtained information or not but you are

543
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,970
never foolish

544
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:52,250
so now a message to or since people it

545
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,320
is very difficult to find the plan of

546
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:57,350
operation of a country to find that

547
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,939
approval so the Twitter traffic okay but

548
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,760
it actually doesn't send it whether you

549
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:05,180
will be in beta turn a vein varied or

550
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,610
not and then for those Olympic machine

551
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,980
learning artificial intelligences that

552
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,199
is important but there is life beyond

553
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:16,190
that so therefore how do you find

554
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:19,430
relevant information so we have a number

555
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:22,750
of objective or targets so members of

556
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:26,510
the government a strategic companies and

557
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:28,190
then also relevant people so the second

558
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,629
point is important if you are in a

559
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,580
strategic company you will get in

560
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,770
trouble with other countries because

561
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,689
nowadays the policy of countries if I

562
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:38,450
not only by what I do but also because

563
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,830
of the companies so sometimes the

564
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,020
company's rule

565
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,370
kind of rule countries okay so now

566
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:48,850
relevant people as well you're there

567
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:51,760
cannot so know not to get caught

568
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:54,830
why is it important not to get caught I

569
00:30:51,760 --> 00:31:00,260
was having a chat with Manoukian pants

570
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:02,240
for our red use a strange theme and you

571
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,700
say it comes from Russia it has no

572
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,900
consequences but if a country if a state

573
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,030
is caught red-handed and they say it's

574
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,800
been you at least we'll have a

575
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:15,250
diplomatic incident between two

576
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,250
countries

577
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:22,529
there will be tensions there will be

578
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:25,440
incidences and then something that we

579
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:27,350
usually disregard there is always the

580
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,429
possibility that after a certain

581
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:36,230
cyberattack someone may respond using

582
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:36,230
military conventional military methods

583
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:41,449
in fact I remember in incidents

584
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:57,309
so what we need we need to develop the

585
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,989
binary we need to insert a certificate

586
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:01,240
whenever it is needed we need an

587
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:04,270
infrastructure and we need to deploy the

588
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,490
binary pig without being related to it

589
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,918
without being identified as someone who

590
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:12,610
is connected to this when you watch

591
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:16,510
mainstream media or things or statements

592
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:19,090
made by antivirus companies operation

593
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:23,470
security think about this those of you

594
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:25,209
building malware at home I'm sure you

595
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,970
don't want the civil guard to get to

596
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:30,580
your home and get caught so one basic

597
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:37,570
thing is to be detached from everything

598
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:39,460
you do this is a set of requirements

599
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:42,460
basically the detection of any

600
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:45,190
information action or data that could be

601
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,169
observed by the enemy and the actions

602
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:50,640
that we must take in order to avoid that

603
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:54,280
this how to avoid this from happening or

604
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:59,380
reduce the likelihood down to an

605
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:02,760
acceptable level so summarizing is

606
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,780
operation security reading investigating

607
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,840
meeting the requirements that I have

608
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,490
just read and understanding the top SEC

609
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,990
is the responsibility of all

610
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,990
stakeholders ok

611
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,070
this is 24 by 7 you need to be

612
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:22,399
responsible you need to be clear about

613
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:28,760
what you do so bearing in mind all of

614
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:34,520
these basic elements a state must have

615
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:38,000
coverage or a cover

616
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,129
don't mind you have everything Wow must

617
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,510
be a constant party in your home you

618
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:50,200
have everything I can think of so we

619
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:50,200
need to have a cover this

620
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:56,690
or coverage coverage is above there's a

621
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:04,490
word that hovers around the other word

622
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:08,290
cover coverage and cover so we need fake

623
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,290
identities to start with

624
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:16,779
we need fake companies as well we need

625
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,779
infrastructure in other countries

626
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,669
I mean you have to be careful you have

627
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,360
to be sensible and you have to do things

628
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:28,359
that make sense

629
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,889
and then a state must have local

630
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,290
capacities to active for example in

631
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,919
Russia I will not do this from the

632
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,379
Kremlin

633
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:47,529
I must have global capacity truly global

634
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:50,290
capacity truly global capacity doesn't

635
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:52,090
mean that I buy a VBS in India global

636
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,020
capacity means and have infrastructure

637
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:59,200
in other countries that I can use

638
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:01,000
company I have a workshop I have a

639
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,980
garage I have anything done is global

640
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,180
capacity infrastructure in other places

641
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,180
beyond my borders

642
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:15,110
those of you interested if you're not

643
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:19,970
asleep yet after lunch

644
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:23,060
the Americans have something within the

645
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:25,129
CIA called clandestine service the

646
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,790
Director of Operations where you can

647
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,790
actually read

648
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,430
a red team is similar to this this is a

649
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:40,710
team that simulates to be the pretends

650
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:45,210
to be an external agent while scurrying

651
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:47,970
our cyber attacks this is something a

652
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:50,760
colleague of ours does all the time we

653
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:54,720
had a chat with him he told us about how

654
00:35:50,760 --> 00:36:00,089
they operate they're really powerful

655
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:03,118
when working on OPSEC they can launch

656
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:09,930
attacks of any complexity of any level

657
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:11,490
of complexity in terms of infrastructure

658
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:16,890
things can get as complicated as you

659
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:21,750
want but if you want to be really

660
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:25,859
comprehensive you need to invest very

661
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:29,940
mind that if someone is caught there is

662
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:35,160
an international institution which is in

663
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:37,800
charge of identifying attacks state must

664
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,230
have the capacity to launch attacks from

665
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,230
elsewhere designing binaries

666
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,800
a lot of people take for granted that

667
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:50,779
these binaries must be extremely complex

668
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,460
and that is not the case do you just

669
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,330
need something that does whatever you

670
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,400
want it to do

671
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:59,360
end of story it doesn't have to be

672
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,940
nurses highly complex you might use a

673
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:08,050
packet a simple packet and you will be

674
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:11,720
ready to go so meeting your requirements

675
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:13,730
achieving your goals with a reasonable

676
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:21,250
amount of time devoted to development

677
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:24,500
that would be is no more than that again

678
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:26,180
you must be detached from it it is

679
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,820
really important and no one can relate

680
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:31,779
you to the binary a binary can become

681
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:35,690
developed and compiled somewhere else

682
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:38,810
and then whoever builds the binary

683
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:42,500
should not know anything about the final

684
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:44,900
purpose they develop they compile the

685
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,660
bug but they don't know what the final

686
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:50,450
purpose but the final application will

687
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,850
be for that bug the guy is probably

688
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:56,560
living in India but whoever is paying

689
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:58,670
for it lives somewhere else far away

690
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,230
infrastructure is the localized what

691
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:05,720
happens when this happens you have a

692
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:09,140
binary built in India things can get

693
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:12,580
really complex another thing is that

694
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:15,220
reach is global it must be reach

695
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:19,690
obviously you need resources and money

696
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,689
to set up such an infrastructure

697
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,050
I was talking to what their yesterday he

698
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,860
is investigating in malware which is

699
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:32,210
actually I thought I was very company it

700
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,300
is suffering that malware to

701
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:37,330
government's wrath world if you need

702
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,220
zero days to give you an example

703
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:42,890
stateside that dozens themselves or go

704
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:45,200
to a company to buy them and they don't

705
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:50,990
make a phone call and say this is the

706
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,850
CIA calling I want a zero day exploit so

707
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,229
that's why the intelligence community

708
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:59,470
must have an infrastructure which is

709
00:38:54,230 --> 00:39:04,160
truly global and then bear in mind

710
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:09,230
financial intelligence remember those

711
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:12,170
incidents with the Panama Canal well if

712
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:18,100
you read the cable from WikiLeaks there

713
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:21,320
is a cable saying that they go details

714
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:24,920
on the proposal by Spanish construction

715
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:27,250
companies a fear on their broker so for

716
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,260
the enlargement of the Panama Canal that

717
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:36,460
canal there was more or less 3.2 billion

718
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:36,460
euros 4.2 billion

719
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:45,900
the state remember the state is

720
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:48,180
interested in a corporation they get

721
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:54,000
information about that tender from their

722
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:57,330
sources and then they contact a company

723
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,310
they tell the other company about the

724
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,130
bits that have been placed for that

725
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:06,480
tender this is a headline from advice

726
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:09,090
the Spanish economy we don't know the

727
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,730
level of intrusion that Chinese

728
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:14,520
espionage has achieved within Spanish

729
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:16,700
companies but we have no doubt that

730
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,960
they're spying on Spanish companies

731
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,879
Colonel millibar we are from the

732
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,280
National cryptology Center deliver the

733
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,510
presentation recently saying that the

734
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,420
Chinese have improved a lot yeah on

735
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:32,820
everything they do with OPSEC they have

736
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,440
become much more professional they have

737
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,500
realized that this is a problem for them

738
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,360
if they are connected to these things

739
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,310
there is a couple of papers if you're

740
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:46,340
interested in financial intelligence or

741
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:46,340
economic intelligence those of you

742
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:53,530
I've heard about this this is about the

743
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,800
defy Porter rules but the fact Porter

744
00:40:53,530 --> 00:41:00,430
strengths you can see a chart with all

745
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:05,520
those elements and that can be really

746
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:10,020
cool but the reality is different a

747
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:13,180
France this is especially important for

748
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:20,470
companies coming from engineering from

749
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:22,419
the pharmaceutical industry it is the

750
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:26,919
states that pay attention to companies

751
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:30,390
to develop their own strategies in Spain

752
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:33,330
with rather peculiar and some time ago

753
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:35,500
something was launched under the title

754
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:38,080
integrated system for financial

755
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,990
intelligence since this was set up in

756
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,569
Spain we didn't work no one was sure

757
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:47,100
about what it meant what do we do in

758
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:47,100
Spain or what did they do in Spain

759
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,890
well the Spanish government uses its own

760
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,619
intelligence services my national

761
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:59,868
intelligence services so that whenever

762
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:01,750
the King visits a country there's lots

763
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:04,310
of things happening behind the scenes

764
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:09,740
there's lots of complicated things going

765
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:14,029
on there's political fights remember the

766
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:17,868
case of a company where someone would

767
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:20,930
travel to a certain Airport he snapped

768
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:23,359
up with this stolen money book would

769
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:27,009
replace in his suitcase same weight as

770
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,009
the laptop that's what the Russians do

771
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,410
if I take that laptop and have to

772
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,900
analyze it with my resources

773
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:39,529
well my resources are limited but if

774
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,880
it's a state that has to break into that

775
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:48,290
laptop they have all the necessary

776
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:50,300
resources to do so and then what happens

777
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,890
when states don't support their own

778
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,050
companies there are come there are

779
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,710
states that don't have the resources to

780
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,940
do so

781
00:42:54,710 --> 00:43:01,610
well they contact companies those

782
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,170
companies deliver so-called

783
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:06,620
private intelligence service

784
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:10,120
intelligence services for that state as

785
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:12,830
a reduced price there's a lower risk

786
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,230
you can always disguise yourself so that

787
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:17,080
no one can relate you to whatever happen

788
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,520
that is a completely different scenario

789
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,160
but then we coverage when you go back to

790
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,480
the concept of coverage and finally what

791
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,339
happens with the others if you've taken

792
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,330
a look at the four binaries that we have

793
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:34,100
analyzed we have one which is developed

794
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:36,920
by the Edison and then we have the

795
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:44,920
others that are really complex in do

796
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:47,270
clue to the designer gives priority to

797
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,990
security rather than efficiency or

798
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:54,860
effectiveness its persistence that we

799
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:56,839
want to achieve if a personal liability

800
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,570
you're already inside the system this

801
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:03,230
binary I'm mentioning what it data's

802
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:05,390
that read was explaining before when you

803
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,410
reset I will find another way to get

804
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:11,410
into your system security above

805
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,410
effectiveness

806
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,240
and the number of samples is an

807
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,910
important parameter

808
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,859
Kaspersky tells us about a hundred

809
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,450
perhaps but there's lots of others that

810
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:28,770
are unknown if we compare this with the

811
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:32,160
other business model with ransomware

812
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:34,770
this is very different i infect your

813
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,960
computer I could encrypt your hard disk

814
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:41,700
and I wants a ransom to be paid for it

815
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,920
and it's changeful I'm blocking it you

816
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,868
pay he gave you like I gave you the key

817
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,220
so you can unblock the contents it's a

818
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:52,440
bit different where is the weakness

819
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:58,759
well infrastructure because they have to

820
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,760
rely on third parties baba is an example

821
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:06,200
this goes back to 2009 2010 without sick

822
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:13,880
in the development of the sample they

823
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:18,020
were not too proficient if you like the

824
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:22,070
world of malware finding something like

825
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:24,380
Baba is quite fair you know it happens

826
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:28,060
very seldom you have strings with an

827
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:30,590
antibody and that's it

828
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:32,810
in the case of ransomware didn't do

829
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:34,970
those things they give you a very good

830
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:37,640
service they have nice infrastructure

831
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,379
they may be Russians Americans but at

832
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:44,350
the end of the day is money they want to

833
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:44,350
make and then money laundering media

834
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,040
methodologies

835
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:56,700
they make money booth basically

836
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:08,349
these people don't move that money in

837
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:11,538
different ways I've seen hackers

838
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:13,759
uploading their ID numbers to certain

839
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:15,499
portals I've seen people doing very

840
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,749
strange things very complicated things

841
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:21,379
but at the end of the day you may have

842
00:46:17,749 --> 00:46:25,990
bitcoins for example the card on the

843
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,990
work whoever's name is not that easy

844
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:33,170
message to take home when we hear that

845
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:36,078
they swing the Russians think twice it

846
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:39,670
is not that easy and above all remember

847
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:44,150
how states behave they cannot be linked

848
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:46,509
to the problems detected our Minister in

849
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,509
Spain

850
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:55,840
very recently identified the Russians as

851
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:58,930
those being operating behind the scenes

852
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:02,760
in Catalonia I'm not sure you read

853
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,759
Russian media I don't myself

854
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,040
if you read between the lines well that

855
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,690
was quite an incident there was a

856
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,450
response from the from the Russian

857
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:19,870
government complaining about the

858
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:23,710
minister's statement we almost got a

859
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:24,940
diplomatic incident because of that well

860
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,450
I know this is an unusual presentation

861
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:30,870
and I know it's after lunch and I know I

862
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:37,990
speak really fast

863
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:50,859
sound logic thank you so thank you for

864
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:52,569
coming thank you so much what Apple in

865
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:57,220
Taiwan was like the muscle any questions

866
00:47:52,570 --> 00:48:00,150
or should we go for the beer we have

867
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,149
that sat on site

868
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,240
questions doubts comments

869
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:18,340
any volunteers for the questions

870
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,210
this comment you made on the Panama

871
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:37,368
Canal I can assure you the many of the

872
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:40,940
leading companies of this country take

873
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:43,849
for granted that we only focus on

874
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:46,640
hacking systems and that's everything we

875
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:51,160
do I keep meeting people some of them

876
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:53,750
are very senior in big companies and

877
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,328
they still think the cybersecurity is

878
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:58,220
like a joke oh yes we spend a thousand

879
00:48:56,329 --> 00:49:00,349
euros on buying a license for a firewall

880
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:06,339
that's it and don't worry about the

881
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:06,339
tenders in France this is state politics

882
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:14,630
nicosia is amethyst cuando se habla

883
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:17,118
sometimes when we talk about

884
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:18,829
international stakeholders and to be

885
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,009
more specific about the intelligence

886
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:23,329
community we tend to forget well I know

887
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:25,719
a case in the States

888
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:29,599
there's lots of intelligence agencies

889
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:31,729
competing against each other with

890
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,369
companies competing against each other

891
00:49:31,729 --> 00:49:37,749
as well and sometimes decisions are not

892
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:39,979
as rational as you have explained in the

893
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:45,249
intelligence community they set up what

894
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:47,538
they called was at this task force

895
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:51,698
you've mentioned something which is very

896
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:53,869
interesting their intelligence community

897
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:57,160
supports their companies in a much more

898
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:57,160
direct way than in Spain

899
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:07,510
but decision-making processes in this

900
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:07,509
level can get really complex

901
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,149
people only know what they absolutely

902
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,580
need to know about what you mentioned in

903
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:18,460
the States is true they have some 17 or

904
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,130
18 different agencies but they're split

905
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:23,080
30 charge from each other

906
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:27,610
your internal I'm external so they go

907
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:30,460
together in general terms this is the

908
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:32,320
world of intelligence people don't tell

909
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:35,250
the truth not even to that doctor you

910
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,250
know what I mean

911
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:42,390
any more questions there were some hands

912
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,390
up there

913
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:48,500
from the point of view of intelligence

914
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,500
services in Spain

915
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,370
obviously they collaborate with

916
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:56,670
companies they usually attend events

917
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:58,980
like this one my question is do you

918
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:03,720
think they may have got involved in

919
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:07,680
certain campaigns I have no knowledge of

920
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:11,580
that because I don't spend my time on

921
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:14,609
those questions Baelish but it is true

922
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:21,750
that recently the former director of the

923
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:24,660
French intelligence gave a talk and this

924
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:27,600
guy mentioned a number of things he said

925
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:34,790
that Baba had been made in France he

926
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:34,790
lost his marbles DGSE and de si

927
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,310
we're different roles

928
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,770
well this gentleman called questions

929
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:48,950
after that all he got a question about

930
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,150
the European intelligence services he

931
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,819
mentioned the Spanish intelligence

932
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:55,220
service he said that staff is highly

933
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,600
qualified but we don't have the

934
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,930
resources we don't have a map we don't

935
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,930
have the money

936
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:07,030
any more questions I see a hand over

937
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,030
there

938
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:18,509
remember there will be free free drinks

939
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:20,640
between 8:00 and 10:00 tar logic will

940
00:52:18,509 --> 00:52:27,349
bear the cost mystery of ilithyia

941
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:32,308
I have yeah two questions from me

942
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:35,809
and when the NSA blames others like us

943
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:39,619
pesky for example should we believe that

944
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:42,150
sure we still pay our licenses

945
00:52:39,619 --> 00:52:44,959
let me be candid David are you using

946
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,959
Kaspersky

947
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,950
this is my point of view I think he

948
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,710
would be rather than use a very unusual

949
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:59,649
that Kaspersky shoot themselves on the

950
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:04,440
food do they have collaborators

951
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:04,440
everywhere of course I'm sure

952
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,339
but a ceremony bracero que se ya que se

953
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,229
infected oh I'm the little girls Percy

954
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:16,349
go instead of fishing SS una mas another

955
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:19,319
operative alec alguien Kakadu sir your

956
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,740
laptop is stolen you know what can

957
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:24,660
happen

958
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:28,020
states can do whatever they want I don't

959
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:31,230
think Kaspersky did what they allegedly

960
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:34,650
did companies may be exposed but what's

961
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:39,210
the average size of a company to be

962
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:41,160
facing really high risks whenever

963
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:44,040
someone wonders about the activity of

964
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:46,470
that company that's it I've seen

965
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:51,200
companies with relatively small volumes

966
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:53,578
of revenues and they've been attacked

967
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:56,609
why because there are significant

968
00:53:53,579 --> 00:54:00,930
competitors someone with revenues around

969
00:53:56,609 --> 00:54:03,569
300-400 million maybe doing business

970
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:05,669
beyond our borders 75% of our companies

971
00:54:03,569 --> 00:54:08,849
are doing things beyond our borders as

972
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:12,119
soon as the a competitor is worried

973
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:16,559
about them you have a problem and about

974
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:18,770
propaganda getting straight into the

975
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,770
matter

976
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:25,009
obviously the question of kaspersky is

977
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:27,339
part of the propaganda campaign I'm sure

978
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,340
of us

979
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:34,020
I cannot fit in there you never know -

980
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:40,230
and I like I know this this was probably

981
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:43,440
an error anyway launching a campaign is

982
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:46,470
part of the manipulation procedures of

983
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,530
course of course I affect you I steal

984
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:53,700
from you and then they laugh but their

985
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:55,470
information manipulation when nature

986
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:59,609
goes to Afghanistan and instead of

987
00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:01,970
shooting the Taliban's they do other

988
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,970
things

989
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:09,029
we have manipulation in place everywhere

990
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:11,740
but we have to bear in mind one thing

991
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:14,830
every state does this and it's not only

992
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:16,109
Russia Russia does it because there has

993
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:19,270
to do it

994
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:24,520
Spain does it of course we need to do it

995
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:26,759
France does it I'm sure they do it if at

996
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:30,850
a given point in time I have a goal I

997
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,650
want to kick this antivirus company out

998
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,660
of the market I will do whatever it

999
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:40,180
takes

1000
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:43,450
no one is half of the people in the

1001
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:46,299
round table coming along later the press

1002
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:48,910
helps to clarify or the press helps in

1003
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:52,570
in toxifying intoxicating everyone what

1004
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:56,549
should I say about this you're a

1005
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:56,550
civilian you can say whatever you want

1006
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:09,430
we need to know journalists we need to

1007
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:12,190
know the style we need to know who

1008
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:14,470
pasted them a few years ago we found out

1009
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:20,770
about political parties paying

1010
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:23,680
journalists to talk about them are they

1011
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:27,420
a means to an end of course they are but

1012
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:30,640
there are also journalists who disclose

1013
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:33,609
genuinely genuine information you nearly

1014
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,129
hidden information you must always think

1015
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:38,040
why is this happening what's the story

1016
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:43,000
behind the scenes

1017
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:44,109
I'm sure there's always a bias but with

1018
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,420
a bit of common sense

1019
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,710
you you should be able to realize that

1020
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,640
they're selling you a story which is

1021
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:53,080
simply not true

1022
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:55,819
any more questions their victim we

1023
00:56:53,080 --> 00:57:05,578
invoice well thank you so much

1024
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:05,579
[Applause]
