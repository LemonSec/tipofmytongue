1
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,580
right Oh quite like my voice for the

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,210
microphone let's begin anyway thank you

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,479
for coming

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,949
this is gonna be a family like talk and

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,289
many of you may know who I am I am

6
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:35,460
physically Diego I'm an architect and

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:41,100
Aviva and honest setups and eighteen

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:44,489
year later I for us your colleagues are

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,170
working an Innovation Lab and we're

10
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,149
gonna tell you about what we've been

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,690
doing lately and I don't know whether

12
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,239
you're really found some cinema we are

13
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:01,320
and we are a cinema actually hearing

14
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:06,350
clap filiz and this weekend they asked

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,350
us am ceremony awards will be given

16
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,980
and here we're gonna tell you about a

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:19,149
horror story about this territory so

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:22,840
when we chose the name shroud talk we

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,120
were like okay so how can we talk about

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,880
these in a sentence and we've got the

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:33,570
inspiration for our title from someone

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,570
who may sound familiar okay

23
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,840
so

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,740
many of you may know him he's the great

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,610
more tarting that appears in the sour

26
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,800
Wars trilogy that will one not what they

27
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:55,539
did afterwards which is kind of cramped

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:02:01,429
and these guy invented doctoring of fear

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:04,640
for management and when they eliminate

30
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:07,190
the Senate another meeting they ask him

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,619
how can we I will keep the old in the

32
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,120
galaxy without bureaucracy

33
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:18,140
I think these great guys said well fear

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:22,070
will keep the systems in line fear to

35
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:29,500
the star of death they've built and not

36
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:32,060
fear eliminates the need of a strong

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,990
bureaucratic structure in place so we

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,420
thought about how can we use that fear

39
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:42,170
to avoid doing tasks that we don't like

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:45,140
that as low and that kind of thing

41
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,179
psyching ok so let's begin with this now

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,529
that is in software development we're

43
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,630
experiencing a very interesting moment

44
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,300
there's a clear trend of applications to

45
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,230
be more distributed and to use

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,180
instrumentation techniques they're

47
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,910
increasingly more modern one would

48
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,620
expect us by doing that the tedious task

49
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,040
of reviewing laws would be something

50
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,040
like this

51
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:10,840
you know something attractive efficient

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:16,090
silent cool but there's some reality but

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:18,430
we reviewed the lungs is this one VC is

54
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,080
a virgin too scary the place where you

55
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,770
get along sometimes it's the drugs all

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:29,860
the time she's come sometimes it's in

57
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:32,080
flames and despite having to not by

58
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,300
having to manage all this you need to

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,470
look at what could use be scaring these

60
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:41,410
dogs this goggle scares me here he's got

61
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,380
a spanner in the shooting he must be

62
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:48,460
really confident so let's talk about the

63
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:50,620
lungs so long sound written by humans

64
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,870
and regarding humans right loss I like

65
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,550
to mention two things they have a

66
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,500
disciplinary different when it comes to

67
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,900
writing blogs and they have a different

68
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,910
information contacts as well so the guy

69
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,910
below I buy them

70
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:10,078
may write wonderful locks well formative

71
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,578
there will hardly shape you have not

72
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,900
been able to connect to port five four

73
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,790
three two because even though that guy

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,978
maybe be very disciplined he doesn't

75
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,940
have any contacts of what he's done your

76
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:24,240
company the guy that may convert it into

77
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:28,229
a message with you information he's a

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,060
guy on top in your company who has a lot

79
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,919
more contacts and he may say well we

80
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,169
couldn't solve any user preferences

81
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,389
really feed us in half at least blink on

82
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:39,930
if he's lazy he just leave the Massey

83
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,250
below like okay so you know you have no

84
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,389
information a lot of problems

85
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,570
so that's all about monitoring

86
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:47,520
monitoring today these guys launched

87
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,030
their logs with different four months

88
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:56,609
and shapes to a central box that's got a

89
00:04:51,030 --> 00:05:00,388
Kafka so all the logs go through there

90
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,400
with different features I eventually get

91
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,580
to later lake which were later saw

92
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,120
storage later warehouse a collection of

93
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,169
all modern we've been great with

94
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,090
processing capability and that might be

95
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:14,400
useful but won't distract information

96
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,090
from these loves they'll have different

97
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,609
shapes which may be tricky we need to do

98
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,840
a ETL for both formats because they

99
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,340
share the formats and you may instruct

100
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,530
information but in the worst case a now

101
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,690
you need one for each application which

102
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,948
if you stop banging the back why don't

103
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:33,690
you get that you feel your system with

104
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,220
outlets and rules and everything works

105
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,610
perfectly with those angry

106
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,460
aggregates and those rules you may warn

107
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:45,870
you that something is good up although

108
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,919
if that happens you know something and

109
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,330
you're not gonna detect it but if

110
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,740
everything goes well this will be your

111
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:54,719
retention time and everything we do here

112
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,130
the ETL and fitting the monitoring

113
00:05:54,719 --> 00:06:00,998
system which is like a white converse

114
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:03,789
and read the rules is the ID

115
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:06,099
Tom he needs a lot of work you need to

116
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:09,009
do with lady l2e rules do the other

117
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,449
words keep them maintenance are you

118
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:12,279
failing any of these things you don't

119
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:16,629
attempt it over you don't configure it

120
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:18,669
well they see of your company my memo -

121
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:22,149
I am on Saturday and then you need to

122
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:24,789
send out your CV as well so once you

123
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:26,439
have a more or less than retention time

124
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:29,679
the opposite may happen that you don't

125
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:34,299
attract a signals you don't you need to

126
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:36,068
do a post-mortem and when something bad

127
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:40,058
happens and uses immune system you need

128
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:41,529
to go to Dargis low log system to find

129
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:44,529
out is happening and when you do that

130
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:48,249
you're pretty much led exactly when this

131
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:50,049
happens you know they've come full

132
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:52,329
transfer into your place and you might

133
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:54,729
or might not now when you do that now it

134
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:57,759
says maybe it will be further ahead on

135
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,889
something else happens or maybe when

136
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,749
they realize and publish it and the

137
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:04,749
Europe rotation is amateur already for

138
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:06,639
your own no analysis may take some mean

139
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:10,209
so many time you know how long it will

140
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,550
take because you need to analyze the

141
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,829
zillions of laws you've gotten stored in

142
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,079
that data like with you from the

143
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:19,329
structures and et al you've prepared

144
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,919
hasn't being able to stock the

145
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:23,529
information you need and your rules have

146
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:27,128
them being effective therefore you need

147
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:29,979
to build new rules and new ETL and that

148
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:35,529
takes some time and effort and a person

149
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:38,139
cost so these IT troubles need to be

150
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,909
paid with interest if there's been I'm

151
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,759
talking you detecting it too so when we

152
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:46,058
hear at the post-mortem you're already

153
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:50,049
dead so there is no remedy they've done

154
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:51,249
in there's our solution used to try that

155
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:54,219
they don't do the same thing once again

156
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:57,120
I remember you but I'm scared of being

157
00:07:54,219 --> 00:08:01,560
killed is a scary feeling

158
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,600
as good a run away keeps me alive and so

159
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,260
far it's worked

160
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:10,800
so that's continued without strategy but

161
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,020
what is fear actually well fear is not

162
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,430
just a letter from the tax office in

163
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:19,260
July that's not good but a fear is that

164
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:24,630
feeling of there's something going on

165
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:26,190
you like well you have a look and you

166
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,870
like yes something's happening so first

167
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:31,400
of all you get a scare and then you have

168
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,380
fear so when it comes to finding fear we

169
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,569
have a splitting two components when we

170
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,729
think of fear we all know what it is but

171
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,330
the Machine doesn't also need to teach

172
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,770
it and to teach or theories the machine

173
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,010
as being with these premise with these

174
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,870
bases there is a component of surprise

175
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,750
when you notice something's gone on but

176
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:55,920
you don't quite know what it is you

177
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,810
haven't find the reason and and then you

178
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:03,990
look at something other than you hear a

179
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:06,859
noise you freeze and you turn around

180
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,690
you're 200 tiger

181
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,660
so that assessment of the information

182
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,670
that you obtain when you turn around

183
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,360
gives you some sort of feeling never be

184
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,360
positive or negative

185
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,430
that feeling positive or negative it's

186
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:27,689
not the only thing you need because

187
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:31,660
machine may have it but we don't want it

188
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:33,340
to be slow if it is low that can't so we

189
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,949
are locking another component reduce

190
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:40,540
efficiency our weapons cannot just be

191
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:44,290
fear and negativity we like Chrome and

192
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:47,740
we were he talked first in this morning

193
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,300
so we are obsessed with efficiency so

194
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,420
we're trying to make that component in

195
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:56,500
to our system and this is a strategy

196
00:09:52,420 --> 00:10:00,099
that will follow to build it will need

197
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,620
to do some reverse engineering for the

198
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,500
monitoring alert system and process of

199
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,550
the law so as big big in here we need to

200
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,670
do ATL's

201
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:13,000
that's necessary but the current

202
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,930
teachers are we a couple through the

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,010
logs four months

204
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,750
half a four-month abash a as ones the

205
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,689
databases have another one and we need

206
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,070
to manage all that so we need to become

207
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,320
independent from that because that has a

208
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,270
cost so charm of the IT tools we were

209
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,230
mentioning earlier I mean we do

210
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:34,150
independent DTS from the format then we

211
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,930
have the other side of the ETS which is

212
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,520
the information they eject and we need

213
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,770
to get them to strong team for my

214
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,689
uniform that allows us to dance with

215
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,710
different models I wouldn't he we need

216
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:49,540
different TT others a few ETS as

217
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,760
possible to try with different models

218
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,599
why we want to five different powers

219
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,319
what is quite new

220
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,270
VA is not easy to model and therefore we

221
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,500
need to try different models to check

222
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:06,860
the response they render in the one hand

223
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:11,050
for the feeling of the surprise rather

224
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,050
and on the other hand for the feeling

225
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,530
and when we get those or sounds real

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,210
assassin will check which model will

227
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,750
keep so which is the privilege we'll

228
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:22,030
have to drive models and then assassin

229
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:26,200
will begin from what simple to as more

230
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:29,140
complex from less complex models more

231
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,200
simple to more a variety and complex

232
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:36,819
models why because we don't like the

233
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:39,270
height here is Indiana Jones fighting a

234
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,730
machine learning algorithm and takes

235
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:46,840
takes six or eight hours to train with

236
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:51,040
Google GPUs and his life is lost like a

237
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:54,730
machine but they find rusty gun that

238
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,860
could sit so it's worthless so we won

239
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,670
that gun maybes not that cool it's

240
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,670
efficient

241
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,980
so how can we talk about later culture

242
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,329
without talking about these technologies

243
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,329
we have set up

244
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,270
the most popular one is the following we

245
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,430
have a massive love spot so we could go

246
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,710
to goth couples not Kafka and we have

247
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,930
monitoring system that could be a nasty

248
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,390
search or qivana it is not in this case

249
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:28,199
Oh or have we done you have exported

250
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:31,710
several locked rooms super tiny midsize

251
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,060
or massive ones do some while we were

252
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:37,290
doing doctor said okay we found the

253
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,569
perfect place to upload only touching

254
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,160
service we put it here in the middle in

255
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,470
the baths we get the locks as we get

256
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:48,630
them and we attacked what's going on

257
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:52,800
okay so our experiment need to have some

258
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:55,410
baseline established several several we

259
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,550
said okay we want basic model do you

260
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,550
find whether there is some sort of

261
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,300
anomaly and then another one which is

262
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,060
paranoid

263
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,060
everything is none of us are wrong

264
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,339
another one is very lazy nothing is

265
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,839
wrong and then we use mathematics and

266
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,110
said okay we need to do something very

267
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,170
simple the renders results so we become

268
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,620
thinking strongly and it's not really

269
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,689
used for the detection of errors in

270
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,910
banking transactions it's quite well

271
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,950
known there was our starting point so

272
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,250
here's the model that we're talking

273
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,870
about it's about MA about mathematics a

274
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,680
little bit and we all love that blonde

275
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,230
to him but he will be if this is been

276
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,719
forced at all

277
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:43,450
but first all the physical or sites that

278
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,770
this Thursday hit here in uh Santo later

279
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,740
he's not running and big enough maybe

280
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,630
predicted sadistically so it appears

281
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,600
about 30 percent of times is

282
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,460
mathematical law is empirical so the guy

283
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,150
who is covered it does not have a

284
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:02,000
formula to explain yet he is Harz

285
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:03,949
reasoning and the tests so mr. Bamford

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,780
was not invented there was another

287
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:10,180
mathematician but he casa did he try

288
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:15,680
allowed but some in accounting said mins

289
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:16,250
algorithms in rivers he was mapped all

290
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,890
the time

291
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:23,420
they've even applied it recently for

292
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:26,120
physical constant laws basic ones and

293
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,089
this is always also complied with so

294
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,940
there's a statistic frequency non-random

295
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:35,600
things have a statistical frequency and

296
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:39,020
this happens you to another local key

297
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,880
probability in a set of silica later

298
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,340
with some probability kind of bounce out

299
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,580
but once you have a criterion they don't

300
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,620
bounce out they go to different places

301
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,940
and that also happens with language in

302
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,320
Spanish for example we know that the

303
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:57,690
most frequent letter

304
00:14:52,320 --> 00:15:00,710
long hello is e if you want to know that

305
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,420
in a dictionary that will be the a why

306
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:06,170
because impending on the usage of the

307
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,610
language there is one or another trend

308
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,829
and not just the first left has change

309
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,570
but in fact also the ones that are

310
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:16,380
long-tailed about less frequent ones

311
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:19,050
also change they were different now for

312
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,939
the teens in century and since we run

313
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,520
long smartly because very rich mature

314
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,950
there's a six frequency may be talking

315
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,860
so first of all we ATL that counts the

316
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:31,290
counters in a row

317
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,240
ABCD parentheses spaces and so on so

318
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,390
what do we do without we were statistics

319
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,820
almost all right so we take all of those

320
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,590
histograms and we pair them up we

321
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,200
calculate the average and the standard

322
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:47,250
deviation and with that we do what we

323
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:50,250
call the character space and we will use

324
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,230
that later on to see how infrequent is

325
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,980
one specific line doing the same thing

326
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:59,880
by counting the characters this is one

327
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:03,000
part of our total model as we imagine we

328
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,030
have a feeling we have surprised and

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,290
feeling and that's what we're going to

330
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:12,329
talk about now he has told us how we

331
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,829
moderate surprise with is that they

332
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,630
stick frequencies but we will have to

333
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,120
moderate that positive or negative

334
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,580
feeling or sentiment that we want to use

335
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,230
to detect things that make us feel not

336
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:27,480
so good the goal of all these is that

337
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:30,000
that of those many logs that get were

338
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,400
through that bus we want to fill to them

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,600
so that we they only come up those that

340
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,430
have something unfrequent or weird weird

341
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,060
in the sense of negative something that

342
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,290
you have to take a look at something

343
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,209
something that comes up every now and

344
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,130
then could be normal but something that

345
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,410
comes up now and then and it's not

346
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:53,670
positive needs to be watched or how are

347
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:56,140
we going to model that feeling our

348
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,610
feeling is different to assess

349
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:02,600
everything seems to be going well do you

350
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,520
think there's no trouble and then office

351
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,860
happened you realize that's not the case

352
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:12,940
how come how do you do that by analyzing

353
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:15,979
the likes we've stayed early on with the

354
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,959
characters of the local content and now

355
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,579
we're going to take a step back and

356
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,720
we're going to look at the words we

357
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:27,379
cannot detect a feeling in each letters

358
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:31,210
and the different characters but with

359
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,890
the word we do we are able to analyze

360
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,810
sentiment so we are going to do analysis

361
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,270
of natural language and we're going to

362
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,250
use the library that's called Spacey and

363
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,490
we've chosen it because as opposed to

364
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:48,170
other libraries which are available for

365
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:50,540
and this one is very optimized to be

366
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,400
used in projects that are going to be

367
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,510
used for production it's programmed in

368
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,850
Python which is it which optimizes the

369
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,160
execution of the code a lot and it

370
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,409
processes very fast and we want it to be

371
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,140
fast so that the flow of logs does not

372
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:09,260
overflow the system's capacity and we

373
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,880
start having a backlog so how are going

374
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,930
to do what are we going to do with the

375
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,170
spacing so far we are going to divide

376
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:21,020
the message in the words and we're going

377
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:24,050
to store them separately so each log

378
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:28,760
line and we're going to store the words

379
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:32,930
separately what for well so that each

380
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:37,340
word can be scored and given giving a

381
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:40,610
score of us to how positive or negative

382
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:44,510
it is based on the information given by

383
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:47,990
the dictionary that have been previously

384
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:50,800
being scored in that sense those

385
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,800
dictionaries

386
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,189
whether or not you have to check with

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,530
experts in the specific context of

388
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,670
security were just using dictionaries

389
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:08,470
that are available in Internet to that

390
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,600
are often used for the analysis of

391
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,270
social networks for instance in Amazon

392
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,189
often to see if it's positive or

393
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,410
negative they'll give you their review

394
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:21,130
they use that they give you to give you

395
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:24,280
a score so it's is the words that if

396
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,410
it's certain see the word good comes up

397
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,270
then it's positive if it's a mistake

398
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,130
then it's negative exits run so that's

399
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,200
what we're going to do to have a general

400
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:36,550
idea of whether it is positive or

401
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:38,770
negative the goal in the long term or in

402
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,530
the middle term really is to have a

403
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,350
dictionary that contains words that have

404
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,420
a negative connotation specifically in

405
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,909
the field of security but so far we're

406
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:56,290
going to stick to to this dictionary and

407
00:19:48,910 --> 00:20:00,790
we'll see how it works so evaluation

408
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:02,710
what have we evaluated without being too

409
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:06,340
specific about our results because we

410
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:08,670
cannot do that this is the assessment or

411
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:14,409
evaluation that we have got there's

412
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:16,540
quite a lot of fear we have assess each

413
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,970
type of model that we've used for

414
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:25,620
instance estadística one and others that

415
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:27,730
we have used as a reference because and

416
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,040
and then we have checked with the

417
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,809
security expert and we've asked him how

418
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,809
do you feel about this and he said this

419
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:38,980
is good this is bad this is so-so and

420
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:42,100
this was our first assessment we have

421
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:46,320
tried your networks to see if we could

422
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:50,699
teach them to detected a in frequency a

423
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,700
linear regressions and we also tested

424
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,700
generated

425
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,080
but the improvement of these

426
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,230
alternatives was not enough to defeat

427
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,090
our reference

428
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:10,270
compared to the time in truth because

429
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:13,389
the time of statistics that we were

430
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:16,990
using was incredibly fast for instance

431
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:20,049
the logs of one day and a half of the

432
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,700
pre-production environment are dealt

433
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:28,240
with in less than an hour and there are

434
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:32,220
a lot of them taking time into account

435
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,870
and and seeing how each model has work

436
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:38,799
this is the reason why we decided that

437
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,780
the statistics and the sentiment or

438
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,360
feeling one we're going to be chosen

439
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,850
because we in our department work with

440
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,729
the agile methodology so what's

441
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:51,039
important is to have something very fast

442
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,530
that allows you to contribute that value

443
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,059
in an iterated way and an increase that

444
00:21:53,530 --> 00:22:00,220
value that way and this wouldn't have

445
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,870
would be meaningless for us if you were

446
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,559
not going to use it for our production

447
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:07,479
system so everything we do is attempts

448
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:11,379
to be useful and to make our lives

449
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,260
easier rather than staying in in a

450
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:22,030
drawer or in a repository so as we've

451
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:25,600
said to link this to the to the lock bar

452
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,899
to have them to analyze them so we have

453
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,428
to read that log bars and process all

454
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,830
that information we will apply the

455
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:34,600
models that we have a sense or the ones

456
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,549
that we have chosen the ones that have

457
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,490
been more effective but that will be

458
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:41,830
dynamic will keep changing the result of

459
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,510
the current models could be improved and

460
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,360
we will make progress in that duration

461
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,879
on the other hand what this service is

462
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:53,049
going to provide that and that you will

463
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,120
see now is on the one hand scoring of

464
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:59,850
the fear detected in the system at this

465
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,850
point in time as I was saying it takes

466
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:09,609
just a small part of a second to do so

467
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,609
[Music]

468
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:16,000
and 15 minutes is what it takes

469
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,100
it's ten makers and it takes some 10

470
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,250
seconds and out of those eight or nine

471
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:29,260
are to do with the docker image because

472
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:31,299
if we run that directly in Python it was

473
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,658
even faster so on the one hand it's

474
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:36,520
going to have in any result in real time

475
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:39,539
of the fear detected in the system and

476
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:43,240
the other one hunt the specific locks

477
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:46,750
that we cannot show you because we've

478
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,659
done the tests with production data in

479
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,890
there are IPS there and everything and

480
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,899
we don't want to get in trouble but

481
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:58,779
we're gonna have those two points of

482
00:23:52,899 --> 00:24:02,500
information and now it's the time of

483
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:05,590
year going to take the leap of faith

484
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,080
these are well coated we do the demo

485
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:11,279
we're gonna show you something that you

486
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,279
can get your hands on

487
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:19,520
kind of roughly read it maybe bigger

488
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:29,200
so these are the libraries our fields

489
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,630
that I'm gonna go over quite quickly

490
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,660
some embarrassing things over here but

491
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:38,050
what I want to show you we have a search

492
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:40,540
to public dictionaries before doing our

493
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:43,000
own because it's a lot of work and the

494
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:46,600
two dictionaries or lexicon that we have

495
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,850
chosen are here we're going to publish

496
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,678
that in github for you to take a look

497
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:54,399
and for you to assess it and also the

498
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,260
service so that you can execute it and I

499
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,820
encourage you to do it because we could

500
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:02,740
surprise in results we we thought this

501
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:06,760
was not going to work but we look at the

502
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:10,360
results and and we're impressed so back

503
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:14,650
to the dictionary lexicon and Cynthia

504
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,409
Warner so there's a lot of data crunch

505
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,740
in here but there is a graph here that

506
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:22,600
I'd like to discuss a little this is the

507
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:25,840
alien detected in a group of logs you

508
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:30,428
can see to the left how lexicon is the

509
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:34,990
blue line it's like hard steps were sent

510
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:38,230
a Warner is more nuanced so we decided

511
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:43,059
to choose Andy Warner because that sort

512
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:50,350
of feeling it comes earlier so it allows

513
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:55,178
us to not when things are really worried

514
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:59,678
but but when things begin to feel wrong

515
00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:02,410
so in to the right in the distribution

516
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,290
you can see how most of the things that

517
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:07,420
score in both are neutral and that's one

518
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:09,940
of the things we want to change it

519
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:13,690
cannot be that the feeling of the

520
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:15,460
machine that has to be scared when it's

521
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,070
a things to do with effective security

522
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,230
that it should be neutral so we have to

523
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,370
change the dictionary in that sense and

524
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,210
now we're going to look at something

525
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:28,739
that's really great

526
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:31,980
here we can see how in a positive and

527
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:34,590
negative way matched is slightly

528
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:51,740
positive request the scores twice a

529
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:59,159
slightly positive then I is negative I

530
00:26:51,740 --> 00:27:03,750
think that's why closer to security but

531
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:06,840
this is a message from Santa melt and if

532
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:12,030
we see how lexical scores it it gives it

533
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:14,790
a minus one in error or warning in

534
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:17,010
anomaly so one has a slightly positive

535
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:21,810
and a slightly negative feeling and the

536
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:26,030
other one is clearly negative so we like

537
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:29,760
the one that's earlier in its detection

538
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:31,740
and the analysis frequency here we turn

539
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,200
things around and and this is the

540
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,700
character space generated you cannot

541
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,950
look at the characters or you cannot

542
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,990
read them properly but for each one it

543
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,690
gives you the central point which is the

544
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:46,430
average and and the upper and lower

545
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:49,260
lines are to do with the affiliation so

546
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:51,240
when we compare that what do we do we do

547
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,340
you get the scoring of the characters

548
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,340
and we compare it with the character

549
00:27:53,340 --> 00:28:00,120
space when you have a lot of red points

550
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,949
to the upper right and once that

551
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,270
correspond to the format because they

552
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,360
are the first ones because they are

553
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:08,820
they're more repetitive ones they are

554
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,990
not there so I'm s that's clearly

555
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:14,429
anomalous here this is not an imbalance

556
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,140
and everything is closer to where it

557
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,750
should be so we have to say how we

558
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:22,200
calculate anomalies for all those dots

559
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,990
that are within the standard deviation

560
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,500
we put a zero there and those that are

561
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:30,360
outside we put one a one we don't care

562
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,310
about the distance so far we'll see

563
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,199
later on and then for each one of these

564
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:37,429
messages you're going to get

565
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,160
zero one zero one zero one and how do we

566
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:44,160
estimate for that line the percentage of

567
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,080
anomaly we have a synthetic indicator

568
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,580
which is the average of those zeros and

569
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,990
one which is always going to be between

570
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:54,449
zero and one if the message is one

571
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:56,610
that's a huge animal I know Carter is

572
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,830
where it should be if you have an empty

573
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,830
line that tells you this is a huge

574
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,870
anomaly but if you give them something

575
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:07,199
formatted and with beautiful words and

576
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:10,229
with a date then it's not striking why

577
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,430
is so why does it like it because it has

578
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,660
the same form what are the other

579
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:19,110
messages and why do we insist in

580
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:22,620
comparing it with other models beyond it

581
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:24,959
being our baseline well it has for

582
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,620
certain depend on the length of the

583
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,510
message if you have an empty message of

584
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,580
an empty message with zero characters

585
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,680
it's going to be very anomalous before

586
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:38,399
locks with us we've said are very

587
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,930
repetitive and non-random works very

588
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,880
well because if somebody makes a mistake

589
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:45,390
in formatting the logs or sending a

590
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,940
message that it shouldn't send or it

591
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:51,410
doesn't capture an exception well this

592
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:53,880
comes up very well and you get very

593
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:57,630
message of people who are misbehaving

594
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,880
all over the place this is one of the

595
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:03,630
evaluation of matrices that we have only

596
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:07,050
those who are in the talk to assess the

597
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:09,960
frequency model about which values move

598
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:12,750
the average the standard deviation but

599
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,300
this was not enough for us what did we

600
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,220
want we wanted to model fear in such a

601
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:21,330
way that it can be a feeling that it's

602
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:24,150
alive and so far we've managed that the

603
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:27,210
machine has a certain resistance of fear

604
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:31,530
if they start seeing anomalous messages

605
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:35,010
it gets used to them and the threshold

606
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:37,470
the fear threshold goes up so that it

607
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:42,950
filters a lot more and it shows you only

608
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:42,950
the messages that look really bad to him

609
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:55,379
so we're going to do a cut of check them

610
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:57,710
what are we executing here can you see

611
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:57,709
it

612
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:17,110
so we've docker eyes did because

613
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:18,970
everything that's executed in

614
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:23,620
distributed environments like the one

615
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:28,270
who have should be in docker will give

616
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:31,239
it a name and to simulate the cough cap

617
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:33,668
because it was huge to serape Kafka and

618
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,179
for the demo if you're scared with a

619
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:39,280
container for a demo and imagine with a

620
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:40,960
Kafka so we're doing it this way we

621
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,510
include the message within the model

622
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:53,880
when we see what it looks like or what

623
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:53,879
it says I say hi sorry I've got a cot

624
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:03,360
it takes a while and this is because

625
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:05,549
it's starting up all the things that

626
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,439
spicy need in order to the synthetic

627
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:10,379
analysis of the world and that takes a

628
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,259
while to wake up the model then it tells

629
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:17,490
you how surprised it is to see this line

630
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:20,129
in the filling olá is neutral generates

631
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:24,629
a neutral feeling or sentiment and

632
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:27,539
surprise 98 percent anomalous so you

633
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:31,049
give them a word that they haven't seen

634
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:32,119
often in in the log then it wonders what

635
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:36,570
this is about

636
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:38,340
you're right hi this is longer it will

637
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,668
still be very surprised because if

638
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:45,090
somebody has written has written in the

639
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:47,549
bank Alex hi this is longer I would be

640
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,610
surprised as well but he hadn't said

641
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,610
anything

642
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,020
it takes a while because it's usually

643
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,330
the back rice the version and it has to

644
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:17,850
wake up the server's and then read the

645
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:22,309
dictionaries and then it does the

646
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:22,309
assessment but in the version that's not

647
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:37,530
we were modifying the script yesterday

648
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:44,760
and perhaps something is not working

649
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:47,180
well but we have here it takes their

650
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,040
logs it takes them to the computer

651
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,410
describes them in a file and it fort

652
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,149
fort match the results in the standard

653
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,970
output and then it tells you the total

654
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,400
of logs the ones that they found us a

655
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,400
anomalous and the ones that have scared

656
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,400
him

657
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:20,409
please take some 30 40 second because

658
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:22,659
we're talking about 15 May but I start

659
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,669
we have not shown you the script without

660
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:28,510
the training but basically reads the

661
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:31,270
file in calculates the character space

662
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:34,659
he trained the model and then it allows

663
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:41,739
you to execute and there are changes

664
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:44,440
every time you executed some way today I

665
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:46,658
was given it if here is quite high

666
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,619
because one of the first lines is quite

667
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:52,839
scary and from then on the level of fear

668
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:56,369
stays around 95 and how do we calculate

669
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:59,230
the level everything that between 95 and

670
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:01,930
and we apply the standard deviation

671
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:07,210
below it what we show as anomalous and

672
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:10,180
with that we do the sentiment scoring

673
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:13,300
there's a whirring word because there's

674
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:18,180
a minus 6 and another minuses we filter

675
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:20,440
the words because because of the IPS and

676
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,700
that we could not show here but

677
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:28,180
everything that we're showing here so

678
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,799
out of 13,000 locks we get 205 that we

679
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:35,109
will have to take a look at which is

680
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:37,119
about 1% and that's quite a lot less

681
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:38,830
information to process when an analyst

682
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,550
should check if something has happened

683
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,549
in the system

684
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:49,760
okay we don't have any more time here we

685
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,770
know the character space but this is

686
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,650
what we have surprise which is a

687
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:57,110
statistics model we've decided to use

688
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,940
this that the second surprise system

689
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,650
because both in execution and training

690
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,960
they can they can be done in stream and

691
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,670
you can have it in your pipeline of

692
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,560
deployment for training and then you can

693
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,350
have it in production and the whole

694
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:14,150
statistics that it needs underneath is

695
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:18,650
calculated in in streaming and with that

696
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:24,550
statistic of how scared it is it's how

697
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:24,550
the thing will react later on

698
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:38,800
so what's left we've prepared this a

699
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:41,020
father talk but we have but we have

700
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,170
other plans I mean more things to be

701
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:46,390
done we want to improve the entry and

702
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,970
frequency detection models to calculate

703
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:52,299
that distance to the average tree what

704
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:55,629
the the how far it is from the standard

705
00:36:52,300 --> 00:37:00,760
deviation another one is the vocabulary

706
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:02,560
to get data sets that are contain that

707
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,540
refer to the context of security but not

708
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,270
only security because we've realized

709
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:09,360
that this can be applied to any context

710
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:12,610
you can get weird stuff coming from

711
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,800
security but also in functional areas

712
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:17,410
there are keywords that if a functional

713
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,150
analyst says that these they realize

714
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:22,149
that they this is not working as it

715
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:26,160
should and then optimization that can

716
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:28,930
also make these to make work faster and

717
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,759
because the volume is huge and we've

718
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,799
true and there are very heavy

719
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,810
architectures that deliver an incredible

720
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,770
amount of logs and the growth is

721
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,770
exponential right now

722
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:49,799
and we also have to say well-tested

723
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,610
we're going to publish it this is our

724
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,260
these are tweets Twitter's first for you

725
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:59,040
to get in touch with us and I encourage

726
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:01,110
you to test it because you will find

727
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,980
surprising things we were very struck

728
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:09,060
but we were so and this is the law we

729
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,950
are like an innovation umbrella for all

730
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:14,299
the innovation done in the bank and we

731
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:21,990
don't write stuff we've recently

732
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:24,630
delivered an article from make a test

733
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:28,109
this please let us know how it's worked

734
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:34,440
your feedback is is very interesting for

735
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:38,280
us feedback ideas or even a for all the

736
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,680
cold we are going to look into because

737
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,640
it goes to the top of the bank but it's

738
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:47,460
going to be open source it will be you

739
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,410
will be able to use it thoroughly and we

740
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,420
encourage you to test it because we

741
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,779
believe this has many opportunities

742
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,540
opens up many opportunities and we want

743
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,400
you to benefit from that and and we

744
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,170
won't take any more time because gemma

745
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,390
is waiting in her for us until we're

746
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:14,150
done he cannot start his talk so thanks

747
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:14,150
very much questions ok

748
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:24,150
to make draw in the other room it will

749
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:28,350
be shown here and through streaming do

750
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:33,630
the speakers also get to participate if

751
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:35,750
you've registered yes but you are a lot

752
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,750
alike
