1
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,659
to our own continuous deployment

2
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:56,940
infrastructure

3
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,940
who here has already done it

4
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:07,749
well let's see if we can do that here in

5
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:10,840
45 minutes and at the diner

6
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:14,379
what do you think about it we're

7
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:18,340
struggling with a mobile computer we

8
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:22,449
can't see the screen for some reason so

9
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:28,748
I'm going to have to do it here from

10
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:32,490
scratch so let's see how it goes I am

11
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:32,490
installing it

12
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,669
because windows I don't have it

13
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:59,750
I'm not sure what I want perhaps we can

14
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,750
switch from here to my and later on but

15
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:12,719
so that's me I got into my 9 year old

16
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:18,120
but she still thinks I'm cool

17
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:22,620
the poor thing so I I am organizer of

18
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,410
Madrid Jas how many of you know it how

19
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:29,449
many of you use JavaScript in your work

20
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:35,669
and you really do not know marriage is

21
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:37,590
rich is is after and we do meetings

22
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:44,150
every month and this month we've done

23
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:47,820
one with a developer who's name is

24
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:51,120
Vanessa he's done a micro service demo

25
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,400
very nice one and next month in well

26
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,440
March March we're going to do a meet

27
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:00,690
that will bring people from mental

28
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,729
scream from the headquarters in Verona

29
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,430
native script is thing you used to do

30
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:07,440
Milan not native application

31
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,639
applications in JavaScript if you're

32
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,560
interested I am developer of a back-end

33
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:18,270
developer at Locke trust who have you

34
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:22,139
known dr. artistic company that compiles

35
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:27,060
logs from other companies and then you

36
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:29,780
can do searches we process petabytes of

37
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,780
data every day

38
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:37,259
so what we're going to see today first

39
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:38,699
of all testing how to do a small library

40
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,639
with 13

41
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,669
what is it useful for and what not

42
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:48,830
integration how to do integration and

43
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:51,990
different development deployment

44
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:57,830
distributed deployment and finally

45
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,830
monitoring so let's begin

46
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:05,430
this is very important who know Shannon

47
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:07,529
Claude Shannon he is the father of the

48
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,649
information theory he's the one who

49
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,229
devised the branch of mathematics known

50
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:16,879
as theory of information he was also

51
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:24,529
fond of gadgets labyrinths machines

52
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:24,529
he's Association machine that is more

53
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,050
people are more enthusiastic about and

54
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,259
it's the definitely machine the ultimate

55
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,259
machine

56
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,890
okay give me a break

57
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:15,439
I'm gonna have to sacrifice a mom or

58
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:17,449
something okay yeah so you're not gonna

59
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:25,630
see it was alright it was fine it's a

60
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:25,630
machine that has gold butter

61
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,990
they even added to the search with

62
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,310
yes it's something like this you press

63
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:58,880
that and a hand comes from inside and it

64
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:04,550
so you put it on and the hand that comes

65
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:07,390
out played off this is all it does

66
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,390
that's all

67
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,959
so we want to automate things and once

68
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,730
we have an automated process we can

69
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:28,529
automate automation and so on endlessly

70
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:33,399
so first of all we're going to automate

71
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:37,540
the tests there are many types of tests

72
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:40,480
you need test integration sometimes I

73
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,370
know that system tests I do my unit test

74
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,839
for my development and once it's ready I

75
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,760
integrate that with the rest of

76
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:52,330
everybody else's code and then I do the

77
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:55,649
integration test and we have load tests

78
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:58,600
when we have a system in production I

79
00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:02,890
put some pressure and see if it goes

80
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:06,070
down in there automatic tests which are

81
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:13,319
the best because they are done on their

82
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:16,990
own so automate there are some rules

83
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,180
imagine I am automating the tests of a

84
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,870
web server I want with a single command

85
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:26,140
to launch the test and how can I do that

86
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:29,680
by design and control a IP which is also

87
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:32,470
going to API and what does that mean if

88
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:37,000
I have my web server a function that I

89
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:40,209
can call and can start the server and

90
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,329
once the tests are over I want a server

91
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:50,469
to stop so I want control API to start

92
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:52,890
and close down the server so it's very

93
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,890
simple

94
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,350
but many people do not design their

95
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,970
systems in this way so they do not think

96
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,100
them through and that means that when

97
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,700
when they want to test then they do it

98
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:09,240
manually I launched the server manually

99
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,610
I launched the tests and then you stop I

100
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,050
do step them they server manually and

101
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,930
why is that not good because it's

102
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,939
impossible to automate it so in order to

103
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,939
automate the first thing I have to be

104
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:39,029
able to do that first part with code and

105
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:44,970
tests ideally should be self that's not

106
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:47,730
good this should be self-contained have

107
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:52,560
to undo everything so the three basic

108
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:56,010
rules are one single button fail faster

109
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:00,739
loudly if it does fail and no human

110
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:04,650
intervention for me the way to remember

111
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,839
this as though I if I were rich and I

112
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:15,000
had a butler

113
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:19,800
I want them him to prepare Richmond is

114
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:25,710
bad with golden bedsheet I have a single

115
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:28,500
bottom to order that oranges so that I

116
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,870
have no questions about it do you want

117
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,170
to run a class or do you want achieved

118
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:37,620
so from the beginning I specify how I

119
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:40,709
wanted and I want it saved and in a

120
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,620
large class and so there are no other

121
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:46,589
indications to be given but imagine the

122
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,820
the oranges doesn't come and I go to the

123
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:51,649
kitchen and

124
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,420
and he's there in the kitchen there

125
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:56,600
there are no oranges but there's no

126
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,639
money then so what I want is that if the

127
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,610
butler cannot do it for whatever reason

128
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,170
he should come to me and tell me why and

129
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,740
perhaps ask for the money

130
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:10,010
so if there is any type of fail to be

131
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,320
warned and finally not to have manual

132
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:17,029
reservation so that I don't have to to

133
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,769
go and relaunch the butler because I'm

134
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:22,160
not getting the service that I requested

135
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:24,320
for him so just the main form of whether

136
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,719
they've been successful or not so with

137
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,209
these three basic rules I can automate

138
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,949
tests so that they can all be launched

139
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:33,649
with a single command which is the idea

140
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:37,120
situation so that you can introduce that

141
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:40,550
in a pipeline of tasks as one more task

142
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,220
if all of them meet these rules is going

143
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:46,579
to be very simple and the whole of the

144
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:50,230
tasks with all the tasks will have a

145
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:53,000
single bottom that I can launch because

146
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:56,540
that if they fail that they let us know

147
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,899
and no human intervention make your life

148
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:02,750
easier I used to work with a colleague

149
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:05,120
and I told him a long time ago and I

150
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:09,260
said let's do the system that way

151
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:14,240
because it's easier to test and and he

152
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:18,380
said no but that's not rational and but

153
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,540
now people are used to and now it makes

154
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,459
increasingly more and more sense to

155
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:26,660
develop a system in a way that it's just

156
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:31,589
easier to test and what is this this is

157
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:35,140
the like that has been all since and

158
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:38,730
103 and I think in California it's been

159
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:41,949
working for a hundred years it doesn't

160
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:45,370
not very bright anymore it's been

161
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:48,220
working for a hundred years so the

162
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:52,330
easier to test your system the easier

163
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,880
your life will be later on so the first

164
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,740
practical session the first challenge is

165
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:04,860
going to be difficult but we're gonna

166
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:04,860
try to create a project indeed happen

167
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:16,780
create test script to run those tests

168
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:18,400
and break tests and fix text if we

169
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:27,490
manage to do that we'll all have a

170
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:31,410
reward I'm gonna see if by any chance my

171
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,410
computer was available

172
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:39,760
otherwise the easiest way around would

173
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:43,420
be to do an SSH from here to here but

174
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:46,020
they are in the same subnet why not in

175
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,020
my mouth

176
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,630
but we'll get anything here okay so I

177
00:16:53,270 --> 00:17:00,170
have a plan B which is to show you how

178
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:03,080
everything looks is not as exciting as

179
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,530
doing it sort of life but at this you

180
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,530
can see it

181
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,079
github.com

182
00:17:48,670 --> 00:18:00,470
no Pressman Tirra Tirra Tirra there's

183
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:05,770
some glitz in Africa or Totten somebody

184
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,770
has hacked the computer

185
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,299
we do have Internet

186
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,789
okay let's try again did have here we

187
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,789
are

188
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,149
and I won't know the password I know now

189
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,149
and you're gonna laugh at me

190
00:18:53,150 --> 00:19:01,730
La Casa del delito things of life event

191
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,450
there have a few seconds

192
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:24,500
to send it thank God

193
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:34,020
so repositories we're gonna create a new

194
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:36,090
one this how want to give me a name for

195
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,150
the new project so you see there's no

196
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:46,168
trick cream creamer

197
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:48,409
okay crema music say crema Oh cream is

198
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:48,409
good

199
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:59,140
you know that in in the Canary Islands

200
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,139
my crema we mean why great

201
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,379
iseman Smith

202
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,539
we create the repository

203
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:52,989
so here it is in order to download it we

204
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:55,499
need to go here and they should get

205
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:55,499
should work

206
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:22,070
but let me add Emma you are heat flow

207
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:24,790
net so we've gone get here clone let's

208
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:31,939
see what it works now

209
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:34,389
no don't go down very good I'll go tell

210
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,390
my dad

211
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,850
okay so copy paste

212
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:58,639
oh right okay let's try it

213
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,179
focus upon our here

214
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,399
like what I don't arrest Tommy more you

215
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,360
know that's what happened when you do

216
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:22,950
live tests

217
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,949
live demos okay so we made it mm-hmm

218
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:36,150
great so now we need and PN which is

219
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:36,150
gonna be a new challenge for Windows

220
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:40,320
is quite amazing

221
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:57,259
no he saw his solo okay

222
00:22:49,639 --> 00:23:00,428
a couple Fiona okay thank God is working

223
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,429
let's run it

224
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:13,429
I'll accept everything

225
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:22,250
because the windows open Internet so

226
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,250
these windows is quite entertaining

227
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:31,730
you know just take a while okay so VA

228
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,630
is that after he sold that I will have a

229
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:37,940
task command and we'll run some tasks

230
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,889
the on condition of the task amount

231
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,809
you exceed zero if everything goes well

232
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:44,689
and that's it with a different color

233
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:48,730
there are some is like we have a single

234
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,730
bottom if it fails

235
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:58,530
here we have the zero exceed code shown

236
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,960
success otherwise it fails she was a

237
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:04,129
mistake saying it's failed because I

238
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,130
don't know what happened

239
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:18,549
so all these security is like when they

240
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:21,429
say I'm worried there is no danger of

241
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:22,000
snakes and then you were thought getting

242
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:26,169
scared

243
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,320
Oh what do you mean was there as naked

244
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:33,240
and you earlier so line up Sarang have

245
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:38,760
any antivirus warning feel super secure

246
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:42,190
but on Windows who so many warnings I

247
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,490
get it good do I need a firewall what do

248
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,490
I need

249
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:53,140
okay so when this is finished let's see

250
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,140
what happens

251
00:24:54,539 --> 00:25:00,989
so now supposedly if we do an Audi here

252
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:04,889
oh now that would be way too easy we're

253
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:08,269
up here neither here okay so I need to

254
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:08,269
begin another session

255
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:16,889
okay let's see how this works is it

256
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:16,889
Bosch

257
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,500
okay it

258
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,740
p.m.

259
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:34,130
okay never mind

260
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:37,280
that's right to change I knew

261
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:45,190
grab my package we're gonna do auntie

262
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:45,190
Anne in it and this will begin okay

263
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,428
okay a MIG Divi new window

264
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,010
okay

265
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,899
so how do we do it

266
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:13,250
here it is Bausch kill bash here

267
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,620
what great thank you

268
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:26,480
okay so

269
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,350
here we put the data for new package is

270
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:35,410
called crema version one zero zero zero

271
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,409
[Music]

272
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:48,600
here's a story now three-point yes or

273
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:55,730
positives here monkey words grammar as

274
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,730
demo some time for this because

275
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:02,710
I put a fake name here and there we go

276
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,710
okay

277
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:15,970
so

278
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:20,760
need to test and here we just need to

279
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,760
put exit zero okay

280
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:32,860
yes and I love just the task mound good

281
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:36,470
we don't need to know anything us really

282
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:39,248
because this is the task amount let's

283
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,249
make it fail

284
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,600
gonna arrive consoled on blog everything

285
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:52,459
went wrong

286
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:59,360
just anacondrai message and process X 81

287
00:27:52,460 --> 00:28:01,580
okay so we run this and be up test and

288
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,600
he says test fail and he tells us that

289
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,759
everything went wrong

290
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,158
so you just need to do this to have a

291
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,870
desk man but obviously he will have a

292
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,750
nativity of things it depends on how

293
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:16,899
language the environment and wherever we

294
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:16,899
want to try but is a command that works

295
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:27,559
how I managed to get our initial

296
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:34,549
objective which was to break them and

297
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:34,549
now we need to fix it again so go here

298
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:45,050
and we write as T zero it's not gonna

299
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:45,050
complain and we say everything went fine

300
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:54,309
okay and a PMT again so the tests worked

301
00:28:49,749 --> 00:29:00,729
fine it's not complaining okay mission

302
00:28:54,309 --> 00:29:03,940
completed so here's how we're reward for

303
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:09,940
having it done so well the reward will

304
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:11,529
be an image of the cool village a host

305
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,869
of thousand five hundred inhabitants

306
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:18,899
it's a big target but we want to do a

307
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:23,499
progression so we have a cheap reward

308
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:27,728
that goes up until the great design so

309
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:30,700
that's part integration so I was after

310
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:35,979
 Frankenstein said all the parts

311
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:38,289
so fitting in correctly you know the

312
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:44,679
film The Young Frankenstein who is a big

313
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:47,710
fan on film okay only two super fans

314
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:49,720
he's not to bother so let's continue now

315
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,489
we need an integration environment so

316
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,679
what does the M here I can try with my

317
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:59,320
local machine to run the tests the fans

318
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:01,650
I've done it but it's quite easy I might

319
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,510
forget to do it

320
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:06,059
so you know what a continuous deployment

321
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:09,390
environment is whenever there's a change

322
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:14,309
I want these to go to production ASAP

323
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:17,150
and that means minutes no days or hours

324
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:19,889
that's continuous deployment

325
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:22,290
so if alphabet to run the tests that

326
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:24,480
mean there's something my going to

327
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:27,180
corruption and something might break and

328
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,000
we don't want that to happen so I may

329
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:32,820
run all sorts of tests before I go to

330
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,550
corruption infant link many tests I can

331
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,590
run my unit test my integration tests my

332
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,169
love into assets before I'm going to

333
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,159
version but I shouldn't forget to do it

334
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,740
therefore any delay should I have a

335
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,170
machine or a sound environment but we

336
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,720
may test my development with everyone

337
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:53,340
mercy so I'm not used unloaded into my

338
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,910
machine does integration environment so

339
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,139
we have development the Machine the

340
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:01,250
development environment and the

341
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,250
productions and pounds

342
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:09,950
we have reproduction replication build

343
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:13,780
environment is something really this

344
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,780
environment where the code is intuitive

345
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:23,889
and you can either create it on demand

346
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:26,500
and create a test environment without a

347
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,510
referee we may have a script replicates

348
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,620
it recently with a talking machine or

349
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:34,230
however you want it

350
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:36,489
we need all in our data to run the tests

351
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:40,390
you should be populated with a script

352
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:42,370
ideally you should be self-contained if

353
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,400
you need a writer barriers you should be

354
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:50,320
created with a script so you don't have

355
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:52,930
to access external machines ideally so

356
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:58,510
if we managed to set this up we can do

357
00:31:52,930 --> 00:32:01,570
continuous integration that means that

358
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:04,090
we not run programming did my unit tests

359
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,340
and migration tests as user saw them and

360
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:09,669
then I launched them all together we

361
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,590
never want to lock your tests so he's

362
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,450
very common that if your problem is

363
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,860
something is you're like ok I want to

364
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:18,640
test this I don't know where this has

365
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,770
been done well ok so whenever I finish

366
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,620
the test instead of bidding it's

367
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:27,910
old-fashioned 8 I saw that my long child

368
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:30,030
does a rectory and whenever I do a

369
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,170
change of run all the integration tests

370
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,090
to check whether I've broken anything

371
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:37,150
that was working because if you have

372
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,980
users you may know that the founder of a

373
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,630
software house Barnes if he's new he's

374
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,060
quite well understood the most

375
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:46,440
concerning bit is right break something

376
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,440
that was working on yeah

377
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,190
so how those regression tests that test

378
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:55,260
everything have been tested earlier

379
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,030
that's how it test whether I'm breaking

380
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,560
anything

381
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:01,530
I've always working if there's a new

382
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:04,950
mistake reported I didn't even create a

383
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:07,170
new test and we are like took my suite

384
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,540
so that he doesn't break again the next

385
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:14,000
time because software our stanza break

386
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:17,310
we sent places if I cover the film's

387
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,620
heart-broken that Paris should not

388
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:22,169
appear again reduce the error density

389
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:26,070
while showing the world is change why

390
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:34,320
don't we do it once a day once every

391
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:38,179
week without freeing a fish so look at

392
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,179
God between development and the tests

393
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:42,330
and these are good for developers

394
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:45,889
because he's like the security network

395
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:48,570
so if I forget to run the tests

396
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,580
locally forgotten to do it would always

397
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,970
have that so could you network that will

398
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:59,129
let me know if I'm breaking energy

399
00:33:52,970 --> 00:34:01,140
besides when I write code cuz I'd read

400
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:04,010
you what I'll be doing and can both go

401
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,010
back and fix it

402
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:13,239
so this may be more effective hey will

403
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,620
you didn't you say has broke so the

404
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:19,259
sooner you know about the mistake is

405
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:22,270
better it's quite important to shorten

406
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:25,870
development cycles it's because cycle we

407
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,560
survived code compile test if you have

408
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:31,799
to do it

409
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,799
the shorter that cycle is the quicker

410
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:40,550
he was a very program for many months

411
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:43,399
and then we tested and we know about

412
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:47,570
mistake months have gone by you know

413
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:49,159
about anything so so to shorten that and

414
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:52,669
you have minutes you finish something

415
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:57,730
you do it you check whether is broke and

416
00:34:52,668 --> 00:35:01,279
the short of it is the faster it is so

417
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:05,770
which clothes can be used so genius

418
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:10,390
integration Jenkins everyone uses this

419
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:16,810
Travis who knows Travis a bit less

420
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:21,470
Strider who knows extra ACP anyone here

421
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:25,430
no one okay so Jenkins used to be called

422
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:28,580
junk in C I know you know the term now

423
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:30,669
is our CI CI means that it has

424
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:33,020
continuous integration you doing

425
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:36,560
continuous integration water Strider is

426
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,810
hanging out it's a lot Noah and they

427
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,390
have you can see being a man this is a

428
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:43,759
big important philosophy change the old

429
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,450
tools were devised for continuous

430
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,570
integration

431
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:49,960
some of the more ones are done for

432
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:52,700
continuous department

433
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,950
so now we'll see the difference between

434
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,810
both ends okay so the canoes Department

435
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:59,180
is more advanced that continuous

436
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:02,980
integration and there are different

437
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,980
prepared to things people are using

438
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,580
which I don't quite like which are not

439
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,649
free software

440
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,650
so let's go to particle session 2

441
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,589
another 4jp

442
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:28,700
you look like a fool so let's look at

443
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:30,560
this crazy crush itself at writing ratio

444
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,509
scraper on intuition script and iWeb

445
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,210
hope to get up I'm gonna grate a server

446
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:37,070
on the cloud I'm gonna run a script on

447
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:40,160
the survey if I'm able to otherwise I'm

448
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:42,710
trying to try to do it and I run the

449
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,799
script and when I ask what hope do give

450
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,660
to get help so whenever I do a push to

451
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,600
the heat hobby it will warn my

452
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,990
integration server okay so let's try to

453
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,990
do it

454
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,529
so the first thing we need to do

455
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,790
is to create a new server will connect

456
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,790
to the Amazon also

457
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:21,219
okay good the one pound

458
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:24,729
it's a bit troublesome because I had

459
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:28,539
everything prepared the other hand

460
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:31,808
however you see that there's no trick to

461
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:38,199
the other audience so we do that in

462
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:41,469
about an hour or less you can do it

463
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:44,140
easily you don't need to have a junkie

464
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:48,459
and solder anything like it why should

465
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:50,709
we do it from scratch all the aim is to

466
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:54,399
inspire you to do things and build

467
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:58,899
things so not everything is done with

468
00:37:54,399 --> 00:38:01,259
the Jenkins and plug-in so that it looks

469
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:06,189
like magic and all knows how it works

470
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:08,529
brother do you know this doing behind so

471
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:10,269
you know the mechanisms we can connect

472
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:12,549
to a new system that is not complex you

473
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:17,368
can do it with four scripts with a bit

474
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:17,369
of tape you can do it

475
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,280
it's password

476
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,279
okay

477
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,910
my way if you need to go feel free and

478
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:52,349
you should even access bigger hasn't

479
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:55,109
come so if we run over time and you get

480
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:58,170
bored please feel free to go otherwise

481
00:38:55,109 --> 00:39:00,319
I'll I'll continue until I get kicked

482
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,320
out

483
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:08,480
okay so here we go I have no machine

484
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:11,740
running here so let's begin machine

485
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,740
class started

486
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:21,140
today I have an image created just for

487
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:21,140
password things

488
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,020
possible martyrs

489
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:31,990
to use me a misuse integration on

490
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,990
slapped it

491
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,950
put a microwave each there

492
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,360
do the same here

493
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,910
okay same demo

494
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,430
yeah we have

495
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:07,349
is running woman need the booty what do

496
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:11,930
young people use nowadays it's pretty

497
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:11,930
okay yes

498
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:23,910
okay let's do it

499
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:23,910
this is assault here now is it not

500
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,070
that's wrong

501
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,700
yes

502
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:04,040
very good

503
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:07,119
okay so we can

504
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,119
something now

505
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:32,589
so now we should generate a code so we

506
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,519
don't have a fuss for versus the age we

507
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:35,519
should put it young as it

508
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,370
something wrongly here

509
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:48,990
you can write a code or say 2018

510
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,950
place quite random

511
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:08,859
if you see these can you get the the

512
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,859
keyword those movements No

513
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,010
so where do you saw this

514
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,450
right

515
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:28,330
is public one right

516
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:34,440
okay you try to be quick instead of

517
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:41,940
continuing with their molars continuing

518
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:47,880
the presentation VA was to start a

519
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:52,200
server integration script I have it on

520
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:55,470
the repository for these cases we'll go

521
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:59,270
here to github or look at the demo and

522
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,270
we'll look at the integration script

523
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,109
okay so let's see

524
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,610
oopsy tree

525
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,610
in fact

526
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,550
demo yeah

527
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,290
and we just look at this here this group

528
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:34,960
could be node we could be anywhere else

529
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:37,270
and what it does is his part here so he

530
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,710
begins listening a port a thousand for

531
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:48,339
example we create an HTTP server and we

532
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:50,800
round this here we do get pool and we'll

533
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:54,310
do an NPT is test which is come on we're

534
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,099
just done which gives you an okay if

535
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,529
everything goes well a one if there's a

536
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:03,099
mistake

537
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:08,310
and if everything goes well that won't

538
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:08,310
be honest like there's a mistake you

539
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:15,150
continue and you have the accent there

540
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:15,150
and we show it here okay

541
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:20,420
and here we go here to the repository

542
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:32,369
and on the settings of the rope surgery

543
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:32,369
we are a web hook which one

544
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:39,750
well that would be the IP of the machine

545
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,750
we've just created yeah

546
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:51,979
and what do we achieve with this so we

547
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:53,420
have the machines IP I'm with every one

548
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:55,939
of the comments of these reports it

549
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:58,339
recalls our hope was that our

550
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,259
integration server even loves the latest

551
00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:03,890
version he runs the tests and he let us

552
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:07,190
now so how do we access that to the

553
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:09,140
browser we begin with that new tab we'll

554
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:12,829
go to port 8000 we'll look at a woman

555
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:15,140
gives back that very page you will say

556
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:17,569
error if it failed and okay if it hasn't

557
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:21,979
so we launch it and we'll look at the

558
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:24,199
result we can launch it by hand or do it

559
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:28,218
through github github they're very

560
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:33,559
clever and if the build goes well you

561
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:35,749
forget you'll give you a check or an axe

562
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,759
it depends so everything is interact

563
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:39,799
with our repository and we have now a

564
00:45:37,759 --> 00:45:44,930
homemade system for continuous

565
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:48,910
integration well here's a bit of time

566
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,910
and does the devil really

567
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,910
so at least we need we deserve the

568
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,140
reward after all the hustle we went

569
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,339
through and we need to have the cast

570
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:04,200
through the apartment

571
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:06,830
so the deploying command needs to run

572
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,830
the tests

573
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,959
we can see that here

574
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:19,098
you see that when he does get pool he

575
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:21,799
goes at them and then pee test and he'll

576
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:25,720
only gives back a 500 200 if everything

577
00:46:21,799 --> 00:46:31,130
goes well okay

578
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:36,669
he's a show function that does response

579
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:41,569
right and we can get to give back 500

580
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:44,900
she goes well so continue this success

581
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:49,220
what is more cool than David Hasselhoff

582
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:53,480
with Webster okay so now we're going to

583
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:56,109
go to the compound and there's a typical

584
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:59,029
quote between meter man saying that

585
00:46:56,109 --> 00:47:01,038
Amateur Softball strategy because we

586
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:05,109
always do tours our team battles and

587
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:10,460
professionals professional army people

588
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:14,480
always talk about logistics technology

589
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:16,789
six why for the army to work well we

590
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,319
can't just say well troops are here here

591
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:23,170
are the holes in our cannons you

592
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:26,170
actually need to take things to the

593
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,170
battlefield

594
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:31,500
and the same thing happens in our case

595
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,930
amateurs are very concerned with

596
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,780
programming details and professionals

597
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:40,290
are concerned with their cars but how

598
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,330
that total of nine can be taken to

599
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:45,779
production it's not just about getting

600
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:49,020
cold and trouble it and seeing whether

601
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:52,650
it is sex so well we need to look at how

602
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:55,590
that cold is his blade easy to house

603
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:58,500
once it's in production correct the

604
00:47:55,590 --> 00:48:01,400
errors quickly diagnose problems on

605
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,400
darling production

606
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:09,190
so deploying goes can be done here

607
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:13,540
depend on the servers are different

608
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:18,640
rules this demo was thought out right

609
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:22,170
now we have C and we have a foul in some

610
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:27,190
directory compile it we have an

611
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:31,720
executable file that's a file and you

612
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:35,430
know you can google pool and ple saw and

613
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:38,620
then if it's integrated we can have a

614
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:41,440
resort sudo service so that the task

615
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,690
begins within O'Carroll and here with

616
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,390
this project deploying it it can be a

617
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:48,340
bit more elaborate if you have a web

618
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:51,009
server and we don't want to lose the

619
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:53,530
service but in essence this is it now we

620
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:56,650
want to automate it that can be either

621
00:48:53,530 --> 00:49:02,380
manually or with code for everything to

622
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:06,580
be related to me DevOps meaning either

623
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:08,760
the Platinum made me because that's what

624
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,759
we have

625
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:14,250
that's nobs in both hands

626
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,460
first of all because the operations can

627
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:20,580
be done with code for that mminton and

628
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:23,610
development team also gets involved in

629
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,350
the counter deployment they just run

630
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:28,320
just program things they also take them

631
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:30,630
to crush him once again we have three

632
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,180
basic rules deploy cloud father it's

633
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:35,130
only one single button if you face if

634
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:40,470
you love us now and theory doesn't

635
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:42,930
require manual intervention and then if

636
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:46,799
you want your life to be better you just

637
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:49,890
make your systems easy to deploy instead

638
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,380
of having five libraries one in each

639
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:54,210
place and beginning with five commands

640
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,680
if you pull your code

641
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:59,370
everything should be with just one

642
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:02,850
single command the simplest possible for

643
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:05,549
example let's say we have the way of

644
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:07,740
micro-services is an easier or harder to

645
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:08,990
deploy what do you think the things is

646
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,810
easier

647
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:15,330
who thinks is more difficult to deploy

648
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:17,130
and who does not have an opinion and who

649
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:19,580
fell asleep raise your hand if that's

650
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,580
your taste

651
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:24,910
so some regard it's simpler if I need to

652
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:28,359
apply something small but it would be

653
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:30,460
easier its microservice here's need to

654
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,350
get a service and we thought it but if I

655
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,300
need you to do the full version that

656
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:37,089
would be more difficult or a new machine

657
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:39,480
I need to add more things of production

658
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:41,200
therefore we don't have a clear apply

659
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,420
dear answer

660
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,299
it's not a clear choice say hey it's

661
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:49,840
much simply if I have my service UCC for

662
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:52,150
some things but not for others so easily

663
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:56,620
the plan once in this movie should be

664
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:59,740
easier what is the continuous deployment

665
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:04,120
well whenever I do a change since I have

666
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:05,560
it in my server integrated tested and

667
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,359
deployed and I take it to production

668
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,200
since I have a script for everything

669
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:13,200
I'll just make the three spirits the

670
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,200
tests

671
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:19,530
also we wondered does it get pullin on

672
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:22,970
Jesus s and true that we are the other

673
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:22,970
one that the plows in production

674
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:32,220
it's around 2010 the Microsoft of the

675
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:35,220
90s the Microsoft of the nineties was

676
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:41,330
already working on the daily build who's

677
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:43,649
ever used an T for drama dolly said Bill

678
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:48,380
1381 when you started it

679
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:51,450
why because Microsoft need daily build

680
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,910
they they run a build and they checked

681
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:58,140
whether it worked or whether it crashed

682
00:51:53,910 --> 00:52:02,970
I was 13 81 because one cycle lasted 30

683
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:05,609
91 days about four years that's was very

684
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:07,379
build the microsoft did comes from till

685
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:08,730
the smoke test they do loop tests to

686
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,070
check whether that work they put the

687
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:15,720
computing they changed with a doubt was

688
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:20,820
rejected she meant after that continuous

689
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:23,520
deployment was invented in 2010 it was

690
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:26,040
being done already and that means any

691
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,690
change in the server was immediately put

692
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,210
in production and they discovered that

693
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:32,810
practically rather than having a more

694
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:35,520
unstable system everything worked better

695
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:39,210
and it was everything was more stable

696
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:41,759
and by because if you work in a project

697
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:44,220
that has slow deployment when there is

698
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,710
very padding production then there's a

699
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:49,350
long list of changes and you don't know

700
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:51,540
which one of them has caused them they

701
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:53,190
mistake the errors thank you and and

702
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,680
it's very difficult to take things back

703
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:58,080
because you've uploaded people things

704
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,629
from many people and you're annoying a

705
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,670
lot of them so this cannot be put in

706
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:05,640
production because there's an error but

707
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:08,430
we don't know who's but if you have look

708
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,350
just one you know what where's the

709
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:15,149
problem and you're not annoying anybody

710
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:17,700
else and Corrections are faster why

711
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,880
because if I have the mechanism or ready

712
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,129
to

713
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:25,960
boolean production then and this kind of

714
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:29,049
take managed to do it and the admin that

715
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:31,420
I prefer is the more you do something

716
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:32,980
the more you practice something the

717
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,740
better you do it and if you're deploying

718
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:38,559
every day 20 times you cannot do it much

719
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:44,788
easier than if it's once every three

720
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:47,890
months and development cycles shorten

721
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:50,859
and developers are happier why because

722
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:53,078
they see their changes directly in

723
00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:58,920
production and that satisfaction for

724
00:53:53,079 --> 00:54:02,079
everybody so it improves your life how

725
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,180
I've explained a continuous integration

726
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,980
there's something in the middle which is

727
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:08,589
continuous delivery who knows what that

728
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:11,140
is it's supposed to be you take your

729
00:54:08,589 --> 00:54:12,609
code your package and you keep it

730
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,779
somewhere but you don't deploy it why

731
00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:15,369
because you're not ready because

732
00:54:13,779 --> 00:54:18,009
somebody has to approve it because it

733
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:21,730
has to be tested and you don't always

734
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:23,680
deploy it for me that's a bit of a cheat

735
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:26,829
because you're not really getting the

736
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:29,379
advantages of the continuous deployment

737
00:54:26,829 --> 00:54:35,680
which are these short development cycles

738
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:37,809
you're putting things aside and they

739
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,690
will eventually be deployed so my advice

740
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:42,339
is to go to continuous deployment

741
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:44,079
whenever possible have we run out of

742
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:48,849
time we've run out of time of the

743
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:50,440
presentation but since nobody else is

744
00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:52,619
going to be here in the room I'll keep

745
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,619
going

746
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:02,210
if he - in Mingo problema Valley if you

747
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:05,960
want to come next door that's okay so I

748
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:07,040
like to all that hot city in the title

749
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,040
because it means they're already

750
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,390
focusing on containers deployment reject

751
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:16,910
imitations if they don't really give you

752
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:19,640
continually deployment at least you are

753
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:25,040
aware that you're not getting the as

754
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:27,080
much as you could get out of it we're

755
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,560
not silly and if we're going to deploy

756
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:33,200
anything that's done we don't want to to

757
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,120
have to obvious ever so we launch test

758
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:39,620
before we deploy and the more complete

759
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:45,950
our texts are thicker will be the safety

760
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:50,140
net and for that we run all suits the

761
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:50,140
integration so the unit suit

762
00:55:53,030 --> 00:56:02,930
we verify results and we do like quality

763
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:07,310
certification which one we have a check

764
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:09,730
next to our bill to see that it's part

765
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,730
of the test

766
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:23,259
instill in the installation test and we

767
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:25,610
are launching it already

768
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:30,140
so this is practical session on three

769
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:31,820
but we're gonna look at the code because

770
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,290
we have to be careful never to careful

771
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:36,740
we are going to create a production

772
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:42,940
service create a script to deploy on

773
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:46,279
production add deployment to production

774
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:48,520
only if tests work and test that it

775
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,520
works

776
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:55,159
I'm gonna show you the code once more

777
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:55,158
which I have ready

778
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,319
in fact it's just adding things to what

779
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,950
we already hot

780
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,950
gonna make it bigger

781
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:09,259
can you read

782
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:19,240
so we have the start we've seen that we

783
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:24,109
do the city tears that they get pull and

784
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:27,319
if everything goes well we put the

785
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:33,440
result and then we called the production

786
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:35,720
server and Warren have this creep to get

787
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,550
these taxes good doesn't taxes in

788
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:40,939
production imagine this is the same

789
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:42,950
machine that's begin that way should

790
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:46,100
that be the next machine if everything

791
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:48,169
goes well we initiate or we do the gene

792
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:50,630
pool in the other production directory

793
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:52,810
and we do every start to reinitiate the

794
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:56,090
service and we'll stay there for a while

795
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:58,910
next part we'll see later on so with

796
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:01,520
that we would have our server and if

797
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:04,779
everything goes well it will reinitiate

798
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,780
the production service

799
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:15,579
and check that everything works for

800
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:21,820
those who've decided to stay this is our

801
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:27,369
world it is not a veto the logo for the

802
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:29,170
world football championship and now

803
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:31,660
we're going to do they stupid the

804
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:34,089
Clubman which is just one more turn of

805
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:38,319
the screw and why because this is a

806
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:41,650
machine once more you made a pipe the

807
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:46,270
big part of Khitan this train that

808
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:48,849
delivers to each guests their food so

809
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:51,790
we're doing the same thing we want to

810
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:54,880
reinitiate to download changes in all

811
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:57,250
the front-end and we initiate them so

812
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,099
that they can get their own changes and

813
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00,760
this is what we call horizontal

814
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:02,770
architecture rather than having

815
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:06,609
everything in a huge server we

816
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:09,540
distributed we do one deployment many

817
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:12,810
servers the production servers have to

818
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:15,880
listen to signal because the signal is

819
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:19,450
one with which we will say there are

820
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:22,109
changes so download the next patient the

821
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,109
next version

822
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:32,610
and integration is the one that sends

823
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:35,200
signals this is what it would look like

824
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:37,930
confusing but the idea is the developer

825
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,770
uploads something to they didn't have or

826
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:42,370
did laughs and it calls the integration

827
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:48,790
server

828
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:49,930
it runs the tests then it tells it have

829
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:52,930
everything went well

830
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:55,870
and the production servers and tell them

831
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:58,870
there's a new version and they that you

832
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:01,420
have give me the last changes that I

833
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:05,830
loaded them and they get them to

834
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:07,690
production then I make list of servers

835
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:13,390
you can get that from your cloud

836
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:19,390
provider the AWS or your configuration

837
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:21,250
file AWS has a very complete API that is

838
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:22,839
very good allows you to download the

839
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:26,080
list of servers

840
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:29,850
for instance and then the integration

841
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:33,700
machine has to find our servers and call

842
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:37,390
them a new practical session that is an

843
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:39,419
access in AWS to get list of servers

844
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:45,549
connect all of to all of them and update

845
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:48,460
and then run distributed deployment and

846
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:50,730
for that we go to our preparatory once

847
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,730
more

848
01:00:55,470 --> 01:01:00,720
and now I will show you the bottom part

849
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:09,260
that that's all of this this function

850
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:12,720
get instances cause AWS downloads the

851
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:16,380
instances and if there's a an error it

852
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:18,390
cuts and otherwise it deploys and then

853
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:21,660
it shows the result which is that the

854
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:28,078
deployment has worth sure you know what

855
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:33,060
it is and these with the AWS it

856
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:37,520
generates a z2 instance then filter the

857
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:37,520
ones that have the name integration

858
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:45,450
have them fry with the instances push

859
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,780
and that's it

860
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:52,230
and with this we have all the production

861
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:56,730
servers and what are the deploy them one

862
01:01:52,230 --> 01:02:02,010
tomorrow we have our instance and what's

863
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:03,930
this number of tasks in parallel for

864
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:09,869
each one of them they execute the code

865
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:12,299
that's here inside through sh2 it

866
01:02:09,869 --> 01:02:14,130
connects to the production server and it

867
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:18,660
to what we what we were doing an

868
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:23,100
integration server in this case we do

869
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:25,140
not to NP and test because this person

870
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,960
has already been made in the integration

871
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:33,839
server when these clothes will receive

872
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:39,470
the answer and then we paint it to the

873
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:39,470
user here and then we call connect

874
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:45,530
to connect to the server I read the

875
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:50,670
private key of the local director

876
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:51,570
directory and with that I can connect to

877
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:54,720
the server

878
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:57,030
I do the SSH and then I can download

879
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:00,750
changes and reinitiate the service even

880
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:03,950
necessary and get pierced answers as

881
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,950
this down here

882
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:15,090
okay so this was the demo everything

883
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:15,090
went well so

884
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:30,580
this is the final reward see how we make

885
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:33,660
the Arab dance I'm sorry but I just find

886
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,660
it so funny

887
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:42,580
bonus track money train four containers

888
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:44,740
deployment to work the next thing is to

889
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:48,340
monitor that servers work that is if

890
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:54,430
they start crashing for us to know as

891
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:59,110
soon as possible this is a plane and

892
01:03:54,430 --> 01:04:02,680
what's the problem here when the red

893
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:10,090
light goes on it's easy for us not to

894
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:13,049
see it because there are so many that

895
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:16,750
word so it's important to have filtering

896
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:20,500
proactive monitoring is let alarms and

897
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:23,140
that's and warnings come to you rather

898
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:25,360
than wait for a user to let you know

899
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:27,129
something's not wrong not right if your

900
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:30,190
boss tells you the system has got the

901
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:32,700
helm that doesn't look too good it's

902
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:35,290
better when you realize and you fix it

903
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,870
so you can say yes we know we're working

904
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:41,230
on it so we have to be proactive every

905
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:43,270
alarm must have a course a clear cause

906
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:47,440
telling you why it's very than a large

907
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:50,460
system that means that that alarm gets

908
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,750
to you and then an association to action

909
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,060
if there are many alarms and nobody's

910
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:56,590
paying attention to them then you're not

911
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:59,440
doing it right you have to remove

912
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:03,580
everything and retain only the alerts

913
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:06,100
that have an Associated action make your

914
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:09,520
life easier by making your systems easy

915
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:12,670
to monitor practical session 5 send a

916
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,230
notification if deployment fails it

917
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:17,760
sounds complicated to do but it's

918
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:17,760
actually just

919
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:29,020
it is not in the repository because you

920
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:32,839
don't usually get to this but it's about

921
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:34,970
connecting to the Amazon API and to have

922
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:40,759
them send us an email it is three lines

923
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:43,250
of code and in that way they call of all

924
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,819
this there's no reward for this I'm

925
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:48,740
sorry

926
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:51,589
so the call of all this is for us to see

927
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:57,250
that it's not even actually necessary to

928
01:05:51,589 --> 01:06:00,020
install a jenkins or by two or no

929
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:02,869
thousand plugins but this is quite

930
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:06,440
simple and in a simple environment you

931
01:06:02,869 --> 01:06:09,290
can set up a continuous deployment a

932
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:11,210
simple continuous deployment system as

933
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:13,069
we have done right now

934
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:16,670
there's nothing more to what we've done

935
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:18,410
there were no tests because the users

936
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:20,960
didn't have tests then what they wanted

937
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:24,379
the deployment they went there and and

938
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:28,520
that system has been working fine it was

939
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:30,410
a PHP not very large register you don't

940
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:33,859
need a junker for that that system has

941
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:35,990
been working without problem for months

942
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:38,390
for years actually and then they call us

943
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:40,910
the deployment system doesn't work I are

944
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:44,660
still using it yes it worked very well

945
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:46,910
and I went in and the clock had stopped

946
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,129
being synchronized so that it was

947
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:51,640
lagging five minutes between the

948
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:55,130
production server and the integration

949
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,960
server and and they didn't recognize

950
01:06:55,130 --> 01:07:01,400
each other so I think synchronize the

951
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,170
clocks and and it's back to work so why

952
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,900
should you do something complex when the

953
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:08,780
requirements are simple you could also

954
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:11,780
have a distributed at the deployment

955
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:15,470
system top array connects to 30 servers

956
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:16,790
and in gradually so none of them lose

957
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,020
the services so depends on the

958
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:20,058
requirement you can do one thing or the

959
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:24,569
other

960
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:26,720
where to go from here many things you

961
01:07:24,569 --> 01:07:29,880
can do many things once you have the

962
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,589
basic system automatic roll back if you

963
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,829
have deployment with a monitoring

964
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:37,020
station connected if you detect that the

965
01:07:34,829 --> 01:07:38,789
system has come down

966
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:41,579
you just have to an automatic from a

967
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:43,650
back you eliminate the last change or

968
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:48,710
the world reverse of the last change and

969
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:48,710
you deploy that so no complexity there

970
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:54,828
stage deployment this is what Facebook

971
01:07:52,529 --> 01:07:57,029
does they do it in a special way but

972
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:59,970
it's basically if you have a hundred

973
01:07:57,029 --> 01:08:02,609
servers you deploy them first in ten

974
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:05,209
servers attached and then deploy them in

975
01:08:02,609 --> 01:08:09,750
the next one so if everything goes well

976
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:12,779
cannery deployment server that you have

977
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:14,579
a new deploys there in monitor only that

978
01:08:12,779 --> 01:08:15,930
one but in their state the stage the

979
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:17,880
problem is even do it with several

980
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:22,469
phases you can start with Europe Asia

981
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:24,179
United States for instance future

982
01:08:22,469 --> 01:08:27,710
flights used to upload things to

983
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:31,350
production that are activated and then

984
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:35,549
activate them with flags so you're doing

985
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:36,929
continuous deployment sometimes you have

986
01:08:35,549 --> 01:08:38,939
something half-finished and you don't

987
01:08:36,929 --> 01:08:41,730
want to put it in production but it's

988
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:46,678
good to take it to production to see if

989
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:52,500
it crashes and so you deactivate it and

990
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:55,310
then you can change the flag and you

991
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,779
decide when you want to start rolling

992
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:59,310
testing in production this is an article

993
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:01,020
that I very much recommend and if you

994
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:05,250
want to access their presentation it's

995
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:09,600
in my twittering I've just included it

996
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:11,870
this lady charity major says interested

997
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:17,130
in production yes you can intrude I

998
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:19,719
think it was her who said in a trade we

999
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:23,730
all test in production

1000
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:28,239
but some of us have a separate testing

1001
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:30,879
environment but she says she mentioned

1002
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,589
these techniques and many other ones as

1003
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,920
to how to test in production and do it

1004
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:34,920
right

1005
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:40,858
okay not much more to go

1006
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:49,359
okay my company we're looking for people

1007
01:09:47,078 --> 01:09:54,989
so if you're interested systems people

1008
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:58,269
development people right - just arava

1009
01:09:54,989 --> 01:10:00,909
NORTHCOM and we can talk ok thanks so

1010
01:09:58,269 --> 01:10:07,119
much for coming here

1011
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:10,058
at this time of the day elementals in

1012
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:13,259
sientate i sorry for that we apologize

1013
01:10:10,059 --> 01:10:13,260
for the technical difficulties

1014
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:36,820
when I'm okay yes tamale porque una

1015
01:10:33,449 --> 01:10:39,040
pregunta Silica's tarde there's a rule

1016
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:40,869
saying to never ask questions if you're

1017
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:45,790
late because I can ask something that

1018
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:49,030
has been explained when you've talked

1019
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:52,119
about they having the code in decade and

1020
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:54,329
then you integrate it with Amazon in

1021
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:57,940
distributed deployment well in general

1022
01:10:54,329 --> 01:11:02,530
you have a gate where you have a code

1023
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:05,110
and in integrated Y rather than use

1024
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:08,290
indicate that for it to be private you

1025
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:13,000
have to pay why don't you use they'll

1026
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:16,239
and us from Alma home yes it's a very

1027
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,520
valid way of doing it I shown an example

1028
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:20,919
here which is a simple as possible just

1029
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:23,500
to make it simpler to explain but you

1030
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:26,280
can make it as complex as you want but

1031
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,280
we Quran de

1032
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:34,200
yes and it's also python yes that's true

1033
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:36,960
you can have a darker image this

1034
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:40,460
integration machine and then deploy that

1035
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:52,050
darker machine that the document image

1036
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:54,300
in many ways the previous company I used

1037
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:57,930
to work in we were in trouble because

1038
01:11:54,300 --> 01:12:00,360
they have sometimes crashed down at that

1039
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:03,210
time there were a lot of attacks to hit

1040
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:06,900
have and if Amazon crashes I don't care

1041
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:11,460
because my servers are down but if it

1042
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:13,200
have crashed down I couldn't set up new

1043
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,480
servers because everything was a jade

1044
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:18,179
pool and I couldn't deploy anything and

1045
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:21,089
as I the moment when I did from my

1046
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:24,990
portion to their pool things could

1047
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:27,990
happen for instance a cycle could go

1048
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:29,910
well and you weren't the servers but

1049
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:32,809
then in the meantime another developer

1050
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:35,160
had done push in the same place and

1051
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:38,100
that's very easy to solve with two

1052
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:40,559
different branches but what we did was

1053
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:44,310
to combine both things and do it someone

1054
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:47,340
do it somehow else in the Amazon we had

1055
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:49,200
our own kid and when everything went

1056
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:51,200
well in the integration server we did a

1057
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:54,780
push to that server to that private key

1058
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:57,300
and then the production services

1059
01:12:54,780 --> 01:13:05,250
downloaded the code of that private gene

1060
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:10,010
so if you have deploying if github

1061
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:10,010
crashes we can update all servers and

1062
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:19,559
push to did have tests that I approved

1063
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:22,920
the tests and I warned the production

1064
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:26,310
servers because I am is in a completely

1065
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:28,530
different repositories so I had the time

1066
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:31,440
we thought of taking everything to talk

1067
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:33,509
her to generate the docker image

1068
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,429
uploaded somewhere and then download it

1069
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:37,440
to the production servers that

1070
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:39,090
simplifies everything with Amazon and

1071
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,669
are the same thing applies

1072
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:44,310
you just need to apply this code which

1073
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:47,250
I'd only be interested and put in all of

1074
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:51,080
their servers a man has also things that

1075
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:57,510
make deployment simpler a lot of tools

1076
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:59,460
this is rough tool in house to show that

1077
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:03,929
it can be done but the advantage is that

1078
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:05,849
I if I know how to use Jenkins I if I

1079
01:14:03,929 --> 01:14:08,130
find one that has already been set up I

1080
01:14:05,849 --> 01:14:10,230
don't know how it works underneath but

1081
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:12,090
if I set up my own system I know what

1082
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:15,089
every part does and I can replace that

1083
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:18,230
with the lambda Amazon or docker or

1084
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:21,239
whatever but this raft tool allows me to

1085
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:25,110
see their structure it's completely

1086
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:27,089
transparent that's why it makes more

1087
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:29,639
sense for the demo by the way I haven't

1088
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:32,460
I haven't written this here but this was

1089
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:37,739
inspired by a talk given by this rice

1090
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:39,570
and engineer who works in London I can't

1091
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:45,419
remember her company right now I was an

1092
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:50,489
American company I think docker your own

1093
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:54,150
container environment and she does some

1094
01:14:50,489 --> 01:14:57,178
things it was cool she paints code and

1095
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,049
she bends darker in 40 minutes she does

1096
01:14:57,179 --> 01:15:00,800
it better than I do

1097
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:02,670
and it was a great inspiration for this

1098
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:09,150
inspiration but they said I wanted to

1099
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:11,699
mention that any more questions usually

1100
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:14,369
it does work you can do it and it really

1101
01:15:11,699 --> 01:15:20,098
works in 40 minutes you have to believe

1102
01:15:14,369 --> 01:15:24,769
okay thanks very much you put up a fence

1103
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:24,770
yeah thanks for your patience as well
