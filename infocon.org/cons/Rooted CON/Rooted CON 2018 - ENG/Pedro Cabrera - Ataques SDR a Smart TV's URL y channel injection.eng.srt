1
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:54,770
and tell stories on Fitz and mobile

2
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:58,130
networks you know we're in the city of

3
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:02,300
of the image in Madrid we have the CEOs

4
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:05,540
of 10 Madrid their Spanish TV and we

5
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,920
have overall satellite teleport and

6
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,620
whenever you see those antennas next

7
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,400
door see something I made that picture

8
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:21,560
that day and now the picture is here

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:24,190
again and talked about today it's

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,720
something to contribute on as you are

11
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,240
then I'll come back to the topic but I

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,510
want to publish the tools because I

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:41,690
think that these will really be useful

14
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:45,350
in your daily basis vulnerabilities for

15
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:49,190
manufacturers or certain models we never

16
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:54,169
you begin playing with that you see how

17
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:56,000
we say it is there are two attacks will

18
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:02,830
not focus on channel sequesteration

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,830
and channel hijacking and URL injection

20
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,470
as the are is the software right you'll

21
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,810
find and he goes by the hand of TV in

22
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,150
2010 some people started playing with

23
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:18,710
Tongass one these are TVs

24
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,930
started and the real chip that's what

25
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,700
whereas the are comes from and the real

26
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,170
answer that real tech chip even those

27
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,489
they synchronize and they tuning TV

28
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,149
frequency they can use it for other

29
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:35,470
frequencies so when they do that the

30
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,470
chip has a converter

31
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,819
converter so all the information that

32
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,420
came from the antenna is transferred to

33
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:46,420
the usb it's fully digital is like this

34
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,220
it's a software-defined radio as yob

35
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,899
because those zeros and ones are because

36
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,269
we're gonna treat them in a computer

37
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,859
when we scan something for example

38
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:56,489
everything we get to computer us and now

39
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:59,200
for the document house so he says a

40
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,900
whole bunch of zeros on once we need

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,730
allows yacht recognize something

42
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,430
something here how Dunkeld yas yas and

43
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:10,440
zeros and ones take off the TV I need my

44
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,310
own software and that's the ser okay I

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,400
don't know whether it sounds familiar

46
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,319
but whenever we go to buy a TV everyone

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,780
thinks about the inches and about

48
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,420
whether is curved or flat and that's it

49
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,480
of course the price but there is another

50
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,798
sandal which is the HPV TV coming from

51
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,798
Europe in 2009

52
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:38,910
and this has to do with what happens to

53
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:41,340
routers at home the router so being a

54
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:45,090
router now they have all sorts of things

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,680
USB files printing servers and what we

56
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,120
want to compute in the route are we

57
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,770
never have it same thing for the TV they

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,920
want to make it in truck if there are

59
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,770
millions of TVs globally and we

60
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,010
developed a lot of line to watching TV

61
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:03,540
but until recently the TV only just got

62
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,730
a signal and that was it so these people

63
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,679
get here and said ok don't worry we're

64
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,640
gonna give you some measure measure a

65
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,430
time see oh wow

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,190
and how am I going to give you this

67
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,140
advertising customized advertisement

68
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,540
because it's going to be interactive I'm

69
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,849
going to broadcast to the right forget

70
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,880
about the satellite it could be in area

71
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,370
whatever the image comes in and in that

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,140
signal you're going to have the standard

73
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:37,130
HPB TV and the TV will archer by a rotor

74
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:41,120
that's why it is hybrid broadcast

75
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:44,669
broadband so the broadband is the router

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,040
although we we call it smart TV because

77
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:50,729
it's connected but we connected with

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,870
those means this is a very schematic

79
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,990
diagram if you are familiar with this I

80
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,000
apologize because I have really

81
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:03,480
simplified just the focus this is an

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,010
operator just like I think mobiles are

83
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:11,310
better known but this is Intel

84
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:15,240
operator content is generated to the

85
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:19,080
left this is the reporter the reporter

86
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,740
with a van and an antenna that is lent

87
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,219
with the radio link with the production

88
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:30,979
center where they prepare the material

89
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:33,570
of course operators have several TV

90
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,849
stations that they have to multiplex and

91
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,770
they distribute it and then it's

92
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:43,740
broadcasted to get it to our homes okay

93
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:46,409
now we'll move on to TDT you all know

94
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,560
this is the rational digital television

95
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,479
but if you're going to look for

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,080
standards you will find nothing about

97
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:59,969
TDT because it's called digital video

98
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:02,430
broadcasting and this is also born in

99
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,789
Europe in 94 we had the first standard

100
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:09,780
satellite and in 1960 which is

101
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:11,400
terrestrial which is what Israelis were

102
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,130
called the television digital

103
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,400
terrestrial you have millions of

104
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,560
standards for

105
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,219
4pd air those of you who cannot sleep

106
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,280
well it's the best thing to help you go

107
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,440
to sleep I won't go into the modulation

108
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,440
details where's my pointer

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,420
do I have a point

110
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:44,210
so those are the parameters it country

111
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:49,490
implemented in its own way we haven't

112
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:51,039
played this part with and why does that

113
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:55,039
matter

114
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:58,400
because we'll use that later as I was

115
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,310
saying the TV comes with those dunkers

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:06,349
how many of you have played with one of

117
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:10,820
those dongles they were something that

118
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:13,400
always struck me this was a manufacturer

119
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,760
- for TV and we've said that the

120
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,919
bandwidth were eight make earth but when

121
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:27,349
you go play and you put it in your

122
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:29,990
sample rate analyzer there's a limit at

123
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:33,349
three more than three makers you will

124
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:38,030
never be able to capture but the channel

125
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:41,900
is eight did you have a clue as to why

126
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:44,989
because I used to ask myself and look it

127
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:49,849
up well it's about the famous drivers

128
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:53,470
when you install you have to delete the

129
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:57,650
original drivers and in the model say

130
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:59,900
this chip has three modes the one that's

131
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,750
originally used that were are you to

132
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:06,198
receive eight mega ads this is the

133
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:09,680
normal TV but when we change to that

134
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:13,010
secret secret mode or engineering mode

135
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,430
we are limited to those who make us so

136
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:21,010
if you ask yourselves because you're

137
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,010
sort of in the wavelength of the SDR

138
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:29,959
if you're not into Linux ignore it a GNU

139
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:31,549
radio is the program when you want to

140
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,948
play without it there's a we're lucky

141
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,469
that there's a gentleman called Bachmann

142
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:38,990
that generated this block diagram and he

143
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:41,449
used this a weird machine with which he

144
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,870
could watch TV at the end it says file

145
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:49,310
see but at the bottom right he got

146
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,589
divided TV so it's just a little program

147
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:54,050
to watch TV on your computer but of

148
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:57,649
course manual so here you can get your

149
00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:04,120
hands into this is 2013 and he did it

150
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:08,509
only for the DVP and he gave it today

151
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:11,389
GNU radio and it was included this is

152
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:16,220
digital television right you not only

153
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:25,639
have the ability so and they decided to

154
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:26,720
create it for the baby the RF as well in

155
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,360
his webpage

156
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,920
he has three articles and he said that

157
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,589
he needed i7 processor the bandwidth of

158
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,410
one channel is very wide both for

159
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,660
broadcasting and for receiving so it's

160
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:46,670
one of the parameters of relativity in

161
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:49,969
Spain has been customized so in each one

162
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,889
of them applies in each one of the faces

163
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,329
as you can see that's just in case

164
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:57,519
you're interested to play with out in

165
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:57,519
the future frequencies

166
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:04,030
digital television what you can see here

167
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,380
in this table is that many channels are

168
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,089
in the same frequency

169
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,400
that's what happens when digital

170
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,730
television that's was not there in the

171
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,650
analog television in multiplexers itself

172
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,200
so in the same frequency we have a lot

173
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,360
of channels this is did't E and you see

174
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,060
that there are blocks and this is

175
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,720
completely regulated there are royal

176
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,880
decrees you know that the operators took

177
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,290
frequencies over from TV and and this is

178
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:35,170
going to continue this will continue the

179
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,060
ad was lost some part of their

180
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,790
frequencies and this will continue and

181
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,500
there's others the whole regulation and

182
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,920
operators and government and there are

183
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,210
eight of them and they call them

184
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,089
multiple digital I don't know what is

185
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:52,270
this but these are regions that

186
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:55,930
broadcast in the whole of our country

187
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:59,819
except for the fourth one where there

188
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:03,400
are local televisions that's the ninth

189
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,610
block and that's how we would be told

190
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:10,060
about this on school ok

191
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:13,150
the thanks to Michael Osman he brought

192
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,969
about a hacker research with a utility

193
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:19,390
where you can see 320 McGarrett so you

194
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,000
can see all channels you know I don't

195
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:24,160
know why in my TV I can't see this

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,010
channel the best tool for

197
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,329
troubleshooting is this one form from

198
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:34,000
400 to the left till 800 you can see

199
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:37,540
everything there's a trick to this

200
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,510
you're not taking the 401 you pick them

201
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,630
right by life time but with this utility

202
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,840
you can do a sweep but without that with

203
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,840
the

204
00:11:49,250 --> 00:12:08,930
and this is the same you can see the

205
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:12,290
nine groups organized by frequency 482

206
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,390
till 778 another way of looking at the

207
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,069
same China this is just a comment but I

208
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,710
don't know if it happened to you I used

209
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,240
to have machines in within one TV I can

210
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,330
see one channel and in the next one I

211
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,940
got none when we buy a TV and nobody

212
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:29,840
tells us what centralizer is inside here

213
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:33,020
to the left 482 there is a channel and

214
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,740
then at rest areas and I have a TV in

215
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,090
which I cannot see it because of this is

216
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:46,520
the tower that they use and there are

217
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:50,000
other TVs all machines that could not

218
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,939
get to those channels if you have in

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,380
different interferences look at all the

220
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,640
channels at the same time and finally

221
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,589
they seeing see issues some quarterly

222
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,240
reports with important information if

223
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:09,680
you want to know about the what are the

224
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,820
share of the different channels and how

225
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,829
many people are watching what program

226
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,570
80% are still using T DT and if you're

227
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,670
going to do an attack to a China there

228
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,610
you want to know which is the one with

229
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,770
the greatest share to be more successful

230
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,350
and I'm not encouraging anybody to do

231
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:30,280
any attacks whatsoever but this is the

232
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,920
place where you can see what's the the

233
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,360
market share of every or the public

234
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,240
share of every channel

235
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,630
I came across an article from Magnum

236
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,950
Aryan marijuana from 2015 at the end he

237
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:50,519
mentioned the same cases in 86 capitan

238
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:56,130
midnight interferes satellite television

239
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:58,950
HBO and this guy he was caught it was a

240
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:02,040
satellite channel in the necessary

241
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,480
material to broadcast what other in the

242
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,529
hands of everybody there were three

243
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,230
people who could do that so he was found

244
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:14,130
but the one at the top he's very well

245
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:18,420
known hendren he was not found these

246
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:23,269
were two broadcasts he comes up with

247
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:27,479
this mask just laughing and later on in

248
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:29,550
an episode of Doctor Who it comes up

249
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,529
again if you want to look at the videos

250
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,229
they're quite weird they're in YouTube

251
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,870
they talked about creepy images or

252
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:45,209
something and the more recent ones in

253
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:47,130
the Lebanon Lebanon War the satellite

254
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:48,899
there is propaganda against Hezbollah

255
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,689
there are other cases but they do not

256
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:54,269
see Quester the channel the Playboy

257
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,790
channel also a guy came in and started

258
00:14:54,269 --> 00:15:00,899
selling religion religious messages and

259
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:06,360
in 2013 in Montana somebody sent a

260
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:09,000
message about zombie threat in are still

261
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,740
Smarties what you're going to find last

262
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,630
year there was an interesting talk from

263
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:18,149
Rafael and he focused on Sampson he had

264
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:20,399
two television models and he exploded

265
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:23,250
two known vulnerabilities of the

266
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,529
navigators one of Flash and one of

267
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,329
JavaScript what I didn't like about his

268
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:29,519
talk he was using a Harvard to

269
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:32,880
broadcaster that was proprietary hard

270
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,500
work with a window program I was struck

271
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,930
by this I was talking it up in that

272
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,400
program in window and and that Harbor

273
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,109
cannot be

274
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,770
metal with but there was a background

275
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,420
open sirs

276
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,890
so if we want to learn that's what we

277
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:52,380
want to use so how do you lose tools to

278
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:55,800
replicate he's attacked and many other

279
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:59,360
attacks that rebel do so I focused

280
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:02,520
myself on we're going to attack the

281
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,730
network client we're going to leave

282
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,730
their network in peace member 2015 there

283
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:13,160
was a very well known attack to the TV

284
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:16,320
five month which is the fourth biggest

285
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:20,850
channel in the world and the Islamic

286
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:25,290
state these are the night of service and

287
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:28,890
14 in 18 hours they brought down 11

288
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:31,969
channels they have to be synchronized

289
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:34,620
and there are many transmissions through

290
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,390
satellite and if you do a German or you

291
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,550
connect to that transport network and

292
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,610
you bring down a piece of equipment it's

293
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:44,939
relatively easy to have a denial of

294
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,470
service than by injecting our content

295
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,570
although there been cases of that as

296
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,400
well but we're going to focus on if I

297
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,290
were to study Smart TV to find

298
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:57,329
vulnerabilities I'm going to focus on

299
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:59,099
the clients I have my TV and I focus on

300
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,530
that we're going to broadcast through

301
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,910
radio and we'll look at the server so we

302
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:10,190
replace the whole operation with our

303
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:10,190
poor mobile computer

304
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:14,519
so first we sequester that in China

305
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:18,829
we're going to use what I've mentioned

306
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:24,709
and all the tools that we've seen the

307
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:27,418
GNU radio you are the editors producers

308
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,909
you can choose any video the web

309
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:34,559
government and you can reject the video

310
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:37,799
of the channel itself and we're going to

311
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:41,039
add some metadata to the channel we are

312
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:44,250
attacking we is the art that we're going

313
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,620
to send again the parameters that you

314
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:50,820
see at the bottom original work Network

315
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:53,518
archers deities this is regulated there

316
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:57,000
are organs there are bodies that define

317
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,870
which are the identifiers and we have to

318
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,490
use the right ones because otherwise

319
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,739
they will find us out so we have to

320
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,259
replicate the information of the China

321
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:11,309
that we're going to generate the

322
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:14,330
information is like normal channel will

323
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:19,250
generate the transports the stream and

324
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:22,529
IDs file there is an Android application

325
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:26,190
it's called aerial TV and you connect

326
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:28,950
you it's and you can watch TV there's a

327
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,000
JSON file when you synchronize the

328
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,620
channel and you have the information

329
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,379
there and you can pick up the

330
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:38,459
identifiers from there in Linux we have

331
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:40,949
a the same way right hand side bottom

332
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,259
you can look at the properties it's not

333
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,470
very clear here but you can see network

334
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:48,899
identifier a transport flow etc these

335
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,710
are the parameters that we need to take

336
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:56,570
to our to our script we generate the

337
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,570
transport file and we

338
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:25,330
so this is the scream we are pick to

339
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,120
videos you can choose whatever you want

340
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,860
as we've seen earlier on

341
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,899
by using these we're going to change the

342
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:37,790
format we're going to adapt that this is

343
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:40,730
mpg too and at the end of everything the

344
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:45,250
metadata are generated and this is

345
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:48,590
really the most important part from the

346
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:50,180
Python script there are plenty of tables

347
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,699
I don't want to go into detail about the

348
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:56,930
physical stuff but the transport and

349
00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:01,280
stream the TS files have a number of

350
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:03,250
tables who have the is very important

351
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,430
this is the application information

352
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:10,880
table here we can name our channel we

353
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,770
can configure our own channel always

354
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,810
making sure that the identifier czar

355
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,620
those of our victim that's going to be

356
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,620
broadcasted then

357
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:31,720
so we're watching TV when you broadcast

358
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:34,080
and then it stops this is the injected

359
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,080
video

360
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:43,500
and as soon as we cut normal TV comes on

361
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:53,590
so this is a proper and right channel

362
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:56,890
sequestration but this is not all we've

363
00:20:53,590 --> 00:21:01,000
attacked one TV scripted tell you love

364
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:05,770
and that's it but your organization or

365
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,870
large buildings only have one area and

366
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,600
then there are a number of cables that

367
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,209
distribute the signal from that area to

368
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,449
every home and your understand why then

369
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:19,090
I said that if we in rejecting original

370
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,640
video it's better because nobody knows

371
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:25,510
that they are being attacked or we can

372
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:28,110
reject it no problem I have the honor of

373
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:33,549
having a great friend who sit in a year

374
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:35,850
that has invited me to his condominium

375
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:40,900
where we let's see

376
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:43,870
he knew the community of the neighbors

377
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,280
we ask for permission we see when we

378
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:49,600
could do this without affecting anybody

379
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,549
and so on so it's and here you see the

380
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,730
box where the area comes in and from

381
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:59,290
their head when it was distributed

382
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:04,299
upwards in green so it was through their

383
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:06,280
four homes to aerials and then to annex

384
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:08,918
face so if we do the attack at the

385
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,260
beginning we're going to eject our video

386
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,690
to the whole of the condominium if we

387
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,179
want to affect only a few homes

388
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:20,429
depending on where we inject the video

389
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:20,429
it will affect a number of people

390
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:29,809
Allah is a great human being but he's

391
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:34,330
also a great body he's very tall so he

392
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:38,000
could help me by getting on top of this

393
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:43,340
Tiny's - he would reach that box in the

394
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,830
picture I've recorded this so that you

395
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,600
can see that there is no trick I'm gonna

396
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:52,939
tell you how we did this there is a

397
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:55,730
mobile in the garage he which is where

398
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,400
he was recording he run up the stairs

399
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,830
there's another mobile phone recording

400
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,650
and finally with the last mobile phone

401
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,809
I'm going to record a second television

402
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:08,000
that's why it starts late because there

403
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:10,100
were only two of us what you're going to

404
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,410
see is that either with his hunt will

405
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,230
disconnect the cable because they a

406
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,540
community of neighbors asked us for that

407
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,809
to happen for just one minute so he will

408
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:23,960
remove the cable and the signal will be

409
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:26,360
lost then he will connect the blade the

410
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,070
RF which is what he has in his hand the

411
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,990
video would be injected and then he will

412
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,520
disconnect and reconnect the original

413
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,790
and when he connects the original

414
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,500
although they signal they're not going

415
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,600
one of the TVs will have seen earlier

416
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,580
but when the second one comes along

417
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,549
they're completely synchronized that is

418
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:47,350
the evidence that I wanted to have to

419
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:47,350
prove that there's no trick here

420
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:57,459
in the audio I gotta love the free hunt

421
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:59,438
and I'm talking we're talking with each

422
00:23:57,459 --> 00:24:01,599
other on the phone that's the way we

423
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:09,449
synchronized and that's also evidence

424
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:09,448
that of what really happened okay

425
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:20,540
the name of the channel will change it

426
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,540
says hijackin channel

427
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:30,450
so he now lives the original one and it

428
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,799
comes up first on the first one and you

429
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:37,830
see in the second one that they're fully

430
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:44,540
synchronized so we've taken two TVs but

431
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:44,540
as I've said sorry this was on a loop

432
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,629
just to tell you that what we've seen

433
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:58,770
that can affect an isolated TV obviously

434
00:24:50,630 --> 00:25:00,270
that can affect a lot of a lot more

435
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:03,540
people I just want to tell you a bit

436
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:08,970
more about the evolution of the as the

437
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:11,399
our boards which weren't really boards

438
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:14,910
but it started in 2011 and the first

439
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,190
ones were serious hockey - and the USRP

440
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,270
which are the ones that both um but you

441
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,720
see at the beginning they're very

442
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:25,129
expensive I have the price there and

443
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:30,870
chronologically how they have evolved we

444
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:34,320
but that's not going to all that this is

445
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:36,629
how is the arts were before when both

446
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,809
cam was playing with the end 2010

447
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:43,620
sorry 210 it was very difficult to have

448
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:46,668
the money and the means to acquire that

449
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,830
we're talking about some 3,000 euros and

450
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:53,040
that's now I'm sure it was more

451
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:55,439
expensive then and this used to be

452
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,820
plugged so you have to plug it so

453
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,250
another to do this Milan it was

454
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:05,730
incredibly complex so what happened in

455
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:08,700
2018 seems that picture we've a lot of

456
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,620
STRs have come along and these are not

457
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,210
all of the available ones this is the ex

458
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,559
TRX from faith we're the ones that you

459
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:21,690
had a previous model and look at the

460
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:25,080
size this is it means that it has a

461
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:27,270
multiple input and output so we can

462
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,060
broadcast two channels at the same times

463
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:31,300
and

464
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:33,750
and receive two channels and it's the

465
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:37,300
same price so we're not talking about

466
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:40,450
the previous prices and this is the lime

467
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,520
Str which I will have not to use but it

468
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:45,610
got to me late look at the size of the

469
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,950
key holder it doesn't have me go but it

470
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,780
has the same chipset that the previous

471
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:55,780
one and it's incredibly cheaper this is

472
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:58,330
like $100 hundred and some and why am i

473
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,760
interested in me me eternal citation

474
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,439
what do I want it small because if

475
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,879
you're thinking about attacking TV and

476
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,290
reaching as many people as possible I

477
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,940
thought how easy would it be to rent a

478
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,889
drone we're always talking about round

479
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:16,290
round wrong yes if you're going to do an

480
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:19,570
attacker I'm not going to take my nitro

481
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:21,610
proof of concept I found a web page

482
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,950
where you can read them in most places

483
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:30,399
when I wrote to them they said okay we

484
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:32,620
will rent the Tron we will let you rent

485
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,420
out wrong but with a pilot but I wanted

486
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,580
it without a pilot because I am the

487
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:41,380
pilot but this is a web page where there

488
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:43,689
is a discount if it's on a weekend so I

489
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,920
know where to rent this drone but how

490
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:49,360
much weight can the drone carry because

491
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,430
in the specifications of the

492
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,699
manufacturers you will not find anything

493
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:58,230
about weight there are plenty of videos

494
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,180
in YouTube of crazy people who lifts

495
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,540
buckets and

496
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,820
water bottles to see how many kilos can

497
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,399
be left I don't I do not recommend it

498
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,050
because most of them crash I only found

499
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,220
this webpage what they said that the

500
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:17,370
Phantom could live 300 grams so I had to

501
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:21,570
call 300 grams whatever it is that had

502
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:24,840
to broadcast be independent and crawl

503
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:28,560
they weighed 300 grams well there are

504
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,020
many hours of calculations the hacker

505
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:35,490
was 300 grams the battery was a hundred

506
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:40,050
grams and the 22 it was 62 grams and

507
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,700
with a cover it was 300 center of

508
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:44,639
gravity because if you're going to take

509
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,610
this and into the drum you cannot

510
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,950
destabilize the electron you cannot

511
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:52,909
these things offhandedly

512
00:28:49,950 --> 00:29:03,900
you have to it has to be a physics solid

513
00:28:52,910 --> 00:29:07,110
solid a rigid solid and the camera I am

514
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,900
finding the new center of gravity so as

515
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:14,030
not to destabilize Neutron so a lot of

516
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,030
work but let's look at it

517
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,609
[Music]

518
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,939
[Music]

519
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:50,950
[Music]

520
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,299
[Music]

521
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,390
[Music]

522
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,969
[Music]

523
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,340
so the drone is testing

524
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:44,840
[Applause]

525
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:47,179
no matter a be a traitor i I didn't dare

526
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,189
bring in a troll here I wanted to make

527
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:52,150
it all over I demo but I didn't dare

528
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:56,180
bring in their drone here okay I was

529
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:58,790
helped by another great friend hallo

530
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,760
I don't know if you have noticed but

531
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:03,920
there's another trend he had a magic he

532
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,540
is a professional photographer and in

533
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,010
order to be able to see it and for you

534
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,080
to see that there was no trick I don't

535
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,920
know if there is a mobile camera that

536
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,178
that's the one that goes into the house

537
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,570
the other way and that's the one that

538
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:19,429
records a TV after seeing how the drone

539
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:24,280
takes off so you've seen the Phantom

540
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:28,520
take off and to record the it's wrong

541
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,840
approach in the area we use the tripod

542
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,150
and he's maybe I don't know if you

543
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,309
notice I don't have to show it again but

544
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,720
if you are interested we can I could

545
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,100
show it again and you'll see the Mavi

546
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,190
that was on top of the house and that's

547
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:42,500
the one who could record how I

548
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:46,100
approached the antenna which wasn't easy

549
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,960
actually okay I've told you at the

550
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,809
beginning I don't know if you remember

551
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,880
the scheme about the operator and a

552
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:55,210
network when I talked about distribution

553
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,460
and broadcast into their homes

554
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:01,580
I've actually lied to you because there

555
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,440
are two broadcasting has through Network

556
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,840
primary and secondary the primary takes

557
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,179
the signal from the transport network at

558
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,590
what we call them a primary centers

559
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:11,450
broadcasting centers but there are

560
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,790
secondary centers they receive the

561
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:18,320
signal the radio signal from those

562
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:20,420
primary centers and they repeat it so a

563
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,950
primary center if we want to do an

564
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,080
attack to a primary center that's not

565
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:28,100
going to work we have to broadcast like

566
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:31,520
a satellite broadcasts or the radio link

567
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:34,909
but a repetitive as we call secondary

568
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,970
centers with them this attack works if

569
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:40,429
that wrong rather than X approaching the

570
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:44,769
house area of course to repair

571
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:48,919
repetitive then you would be affecting

572
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:52,730
thousands or hundreds of homes okay this

573
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:55,759
is a Channel sequestration I wanted to

574
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,830
show you how easy it is to do so in

575
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:01,399
television nobody's authenticating the

576
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:03,619
signal of course and do not think that

577
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:06,590
you can just do it at home you can

578
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:10,129
actually reach a lot of people what for

579
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:12,769
to broadcast video yes you can advertise

580
00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:14,480
in propaganda you can reject their

581
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:19,159
original signal because you'll remember

582
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,379
the server if you've done the capture of

583
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,509
the traffic of your TV you will see that

584
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:28,610
each time you're watching TV it's making

585
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:32,119
requests to servers that I guess it's a

586
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:36,889
good practice in the domain they write

587
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:40,340
the H B BT the dot and many people get

588
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:44,209
confused by this they say number one and

589
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:48,610
two have that not only the application

590
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:51,980
of channel one and two you can view it

591
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:54,649
and it takes it the other channels have

592
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,360
an application as well I guess is that

593
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:58,100
what they do is that they're saving this

594
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,080
the fixes that they used to have to call

595
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,539
they are going to know and you will see

596
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,460
that they are regular every certain time

597
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:07,070
the TV connects itself again

598
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,980
and here comes the best so far we've

599
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:12,500
seen how the video was broadcasted but

600
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:16,490
in that signal we're actually sending

601
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:19,869
our own you are all so URL so we can

602
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:19,868
send the video and there you are

603
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:28,330
the other thing that's gonna change is

604
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:31,060
that interpret that item besides having

605
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:33,429
to include the identifier that we

606
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:37,029
mentioned before we have an open field

607
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:40,360
which is the you were all happy named

608
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:42,160
rooted this is our application that

609
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,120
doesn't have too much the anyit

610
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:51,940
serve route the IP of our server and

611
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:55,719
path the file index.html or whatever we

612
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:58,780
want so when we broadcast this video we

613
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:03,100
make the CV if it's connected to access

614
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:06,490
that URL so so far we're talking about

615
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,650
Hatton having fun but perhaps I want to

616
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,560
inject the original video into the

617
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,510
attack here in that way the victim will

618
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:19,450
not know their pain at hack they're

619
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:23,290
still watching TV and the URL because if

620
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:28,149
ash Rafael told us you know availability

621
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:30,430
of the TV you can exploit it kilometres

622
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:32,980
away and thousands of victims you only

623
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:36,399
need to know what TP what vulnerability

624
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,650
and to broadcast wherever I want to have

625
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,420
an impact I want to tell you before I

626
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,800
continue because this is going to get

627
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,540
even more complicated there is a

628
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,660
navigator within a smart TV

629
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,970
there is one which is HPV TV which is

630
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,790
automatic and with the signal that comes

631
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:54,549
through radio it's going to access that

632
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:56,470
URL which is what you have just seen but

633
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,990
all Smart TVs also have another

634
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:02,470
navigator which is the user navigator

635
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:05,080
when as a user you access TV you always

636
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:08,290
have one navigator which because these

637
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,360
TVs are designed so that you can

638
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:13,000
navigate while you're sitting

639
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,520
comfortably at home being hacked in and

640
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,120
that browser is much easier doesn't make

641
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:22,150
sense for the user browser to attack it

642
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,410
via ser because valve is browsing a kink

643
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:27,799
in he can check the website he wants

644
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:30,558
so the techniques we have are the usual

645
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:31,970
RP poison NS I'm joking but need to know

646
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,869
the Wi-Fi of the guy I need to be

647
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:38,750
connected to do that okay

648
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:40,819
he should know these are two browsers

649
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:44,809
were two different types of towns long

650
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:47,210
his remote he's an example have access

651
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:51,710
to two TVs and a lot of the fortune of

652
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:53,869
calibrating the orange last year and we

653
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:58,789
were able to see uh something here are

654
00:36:53,869 --> 00:37:02,420
the two user agents this Panasonic is

655
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:04,970
wrong here the work will easier on the

656
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,700
user agent they have the good practice

657
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:11,439
of showing the model to my father of the

658
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,439
TV which is right

659
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:21,680
because if I send out my signal in

660
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,538
housing government the first Renault

661
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,279
Aachen can do we say is marked if he is

662
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:29,240
coming on the apartheid laws

663
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,190
I can look TVs that are watching that

664
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,660
channel because I'm broadcasting one or

665
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:37,339
several channels I can give each other

666
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:41,089
an IEP or a different your high so now

667
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:44,630
which model and which TV is watching

668
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:46,069
each channel with the IP public to start

669
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,460
with and we can given assess the

670
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:48,460
audience

671
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,130
neck's obviously after years playing

672
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:57,990
with captive portals I don't know but

673
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,450
the first unknowable you were the first

674
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:02,040
thought the first thing I thought it was

675
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:08,089
hey something you know I could have my

676
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:10,710
own application okay so even better

677
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:15,390
maybe you're thinking about house but

678
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:17,700
many companies are the entrance other

679
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:22,069
places to look cool they have a video

680
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:25,169
wall or very cool 40 million in TV or

681
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,550
calcium some sort of corporate video so

682
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:30,960
that whenever there are visits

683
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:33,690
oh what a cool company it's a great film

684
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,580
or a great video but now they're not

685
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,470
watching TV so bro Carson TV that

686
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,690
doesn't make much sense here we have a

687
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:41,430
dryer that I'll put on the wrong these

688
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,500
cannot be done on the raspberry the CPU

689
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:46,710
doesn't the holidays it's got a small

690
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:50,820
bathroom here we have the hawk RF if you

691
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:54,180
want TV to be seen properly with a good

692
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:56,730
quality your fault radio you cannot get

693
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:59,850
directly with an antenna cable I've got

694
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,800
this cable because these TV has the plug

695
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:04,920
looking downwards otherwise is between

696
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,300
your top you leave that you plug in to

697
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,870
the antenna you go away

698
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,870
I think these costs about 200 euros

699
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:17,040
while the hawk RC is a bit more classy

700
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:20,730
might be 300 euros is a mountain that

701
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,090
aside you back anyway cannot be sue the

702
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,090
TV

703
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,879
I can't believe watcher this is the

704
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,030
normal TV is not connected I didn't know

705
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:37,680
we were gonna have the signal here but

706
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:40,020
we are closed to tell him into it okay

707
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,859
great so you're gonna ever see better I

708
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:46,530
didn't think you you'd be able to see

709
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:52,020
well he's my attacker that was supposed

710
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:55,230
to be blocking her leave disconnected he

711
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:57,380
has a self start hope do not take too

712
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,380
long

713
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:08,820
this and this would many companies half

714
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:10,770
my company's is playing its my video to

715
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,750
give it in many places and in many areas

716
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:14,250
there they won't realize and the real

717
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:18,030
attack this will they usually have on a

718
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:24,830
video wall so you can you already want

719
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:24,830
that really okay

720
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:47,700
what I meant it

721
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:49,470
oceanography Ladell exterminate up just

722
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:54,899
give me a second tell the TV that is

723
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:59,359
connected through the cable maybe will

724
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,360
complain because of lack of the Internet

725
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,810
okay have you seen that the application

726
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:12,049
just loaded on I told you he was

727
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:15,360
connected it was off earlier and it's

728
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:19,920
lovely navigator is the HP B TV is

729
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:26,100
rendered my HTML page this has been done

730
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:29,100
on the purpose and he's got the booted

731
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:31,920
Lago he's a usual captive portal if you

732
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:35,520
change that logo by the manufacturer and

733
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,950
you work on a nature like hey this has

734
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,720
been updated and use an outer form can

735
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:44,240
you please confirm your Wi-Fi name in

736
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:48,359
the world update it so you have a word T

737
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,180
Kibo you can move these buttons there

738
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:56,480
you go

739
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:58,839
when you accept it's a basic you can see

740
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,839
it here

741
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:10,680
you have that file

742
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:14,480
and here you have what the user replied

743
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,480
to the phone you see it well

744
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:35,710
Valley in SF Ichiro configuration

745
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:39,640
setting low Yama so-called these final

746
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:43,350
configuration settings I wanted I wanted

747
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:46,089
something in these forms on Europe ash a

748
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:49,750
browser you have the IP the TV and the

749
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:53,130
Wi-Fi in a very simple way is the usual

750
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,130
classic social engineering

751
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,470
a monkey lover

752
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:10,420
I thought a keylogger attack could be

753
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:13,269
bung-bung HPB TV the guys watching TV is

754
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:16,720
gonna not gonna keying anything I didn't

755
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:18,339
seat for the use of browsers if the guy

756
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,919
is browsing at home doing whatever

757
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:23,979
whatever he writes is a JavaScript you

758
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,729
can inject it and we'll see it later you

759
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,729
may inject it

760
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:39,349
here we have a keylogger so everything

761
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:48,349
they press our sword on that text file

762
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:53,130
they go to browser they're using a

763
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:56,190
newspapers website and the what the TV

764
00:43:53,130 --> 00:44:01,890
reads the website uses if it wasn't a

765
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:03,839
smart or multimedia enough and if you

766
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,660
want to watch some of these Emma or

767
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,119
something silly there's no problem

768
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:12,500
there's not to change them so I'm

769
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:16,170
showing it to the video and on the X in

770
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:19,349
the taxi later you have all the keys on

771
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:21,510
the codes this is quite limited but here

772
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:22,859
you may see the proof of concept and see

773
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:26,039
that the keylogger is actually working

774
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:29,009
and it just needs to be adapted to the

775
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:31,589
standard okay so this is going in a loop

776
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:34,049
but you just need to send it to the HPV

777
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:36,299
TV Santa to use need to mark the keys

778
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:38,940
and it's super simple to use not need to

779
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:42,270
know the code and a text file you have

780
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:46,400
all the keys at the guy house breast and

781
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:49,710
what else well likely we see loads of

782
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,569
cryptocurrency mining and this also

783
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:57,720
loaded on websites and TVs read websites

784
00:44:53,569 --> 00:45:00,109
that was a JavaScript looks like it

785
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,109
doesn't it

786
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:12,839
okay so you took quite a bit quite a

787
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:18,240
while I've use it echoing anyway this

788
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:20,580
guy he's a simple we the most basic one

789
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,799
and after all the attacks and all these

790
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:25,830
things but now the ultrasound is not

791
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,540
working there's a flood I'm JavaScript

792
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:31,710
through to my not much but it doesn't

793
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:33,450
work the first time the user needs to go

794
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:36,390
to start mining do you accept that

795
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:40,319
you're gonna mind recurrences and think

796
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:42,450
it's mines so I just wanted to check on

797
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:47,640
the city on the Panasonic these wouldn't

798
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:48,990
work it was a steam variations they'll

799
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,960
go the JavaScript from one of those

800
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:54,779
attacks where the code is really

801
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,060
modified to have ultrasound ourselves

802
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:59,010
it's not

803
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:02,400
ultrasonic maybe to do web sockets but

804
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:05,030
what I see the the source code there is

805
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,030
a first stage

806
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:16,950
Kinesis in the Attic so yes I'm the

807
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:23,750
wizard culture first of all he loves the

808
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:26,430
applet perfectly he establishes the HTTP

809
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,980
connection with your flyer next with

810
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:34,819
navigator when it comes to creating the

811
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:34,820
WebSocket on this DVD stays there

812
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:52,760
and these are service IP here are the

813
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:52,759
first HTTP negotiations there it is last

814
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,670
the last thing that I think made sense

815
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:01,650
was Matt exploit right if you want to

816
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:03,390
research vulnerabilities and look at

817
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:08,790
those now browsers seriously we have

818
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:11,310
beef with met exploit same thing does

819
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:15,029
make sense retrieve eh will be TV or the

820
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:18,480
user I think makes more time to talk

821
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:20,790
both or might be more interested in

822
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,990
checking out the results on the user's

823
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:29,370
browser I'm using better cop then Ong

824
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:32,819
better cop between Jack JavaScript one

825
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:39,150
day using injecting one of those in

826
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:41,100
website I hooked a navigator browser we

827
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:43,640
have a JavaScript code we have a better

828
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:48,950
cop who my computer and the TV the beef

829
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,950
with Matt exploit and he's just writing

830
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,140
we just want to be actually

831
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:11,470
and it actually hooks the browser knew

832
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:15,100
who browser there are the details and we

833
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:17,980
send an invisible e frame with the met

834
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:20,770
exploit sought easily the browser auto

835
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,420
Punk I have the URL of the medics bodies

836
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,860
working for and I put that on the frame

837
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:27,490
and copy it

838
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:33,850
we hook it command we create an

839
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:38,680
invisible frame we're seeing a deceit

840
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:40,569
does video and when we send a frame to

841
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,589
now to the browser much as blog begins

842
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,590
work him

843
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:57,740
okay so it's that conclusion a few years

844
00:48:54,619 --> 00:49:01,309
ago when we all have fun we didn't care

845
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,779
about the approaching system in care

846
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:05,690
could be an Ericsson and okay are you

847
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:07,460
use had a phone mobile device right now

848
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:10,069
we don't really care about the operating

849
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:12,859
system of the phone we all the browser

850
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:15,640
it has because we know all the

851
00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:15,640
vulnerabilities

852
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,970
I came to phone when they became as

853
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,890
marked and nothing the same thing is

854
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:24,709
happening to TVs but no one is talking

855
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:26,890
about that and that's when you go to my

856
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:30,559
TV maybe you don't care about inches

857
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:34,009
I've mentioned and there's no operating

858
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,569
systems are several and here are the two

859
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,790
TVs of my dear Anonymous

860
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:39,950
these are the two TVs I could check with

861
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:42,500
the results of those at ours which

862
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:46,509
operating system and each browser we

863
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:49,790
made how may have different results so

864
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:51,770
the attacks we've seen are local they

865
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:55,130
focused on the fact that you could audit

866
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:57,920
your Smart TV so instead of doing those

867
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:01,040
attacks on our TV if we do them on the

868
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:06,440
web server so that we seem for each

869
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:09,980
operator they're actually compromising

870
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:12,740
many TVs and those webs there will have

871
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:15,910
vulnerability so that no one can carry

872
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,910
out that type of dark

873
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:25,959
and just gives me a bit of time our part

874
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:33,790
on the github repository the only thing

875
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:37,270
you need is again your radio 3.7 one and

876
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:39,520
your ass your device as well as your

877
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:41,580
Smart TV and this is all from me thank

878
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,580
you

879
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:55,260
excuse me what you don't have time for

880
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:57,450
questions so you can ask him things

881
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,010
outside while you have a snack thank you

882
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:13,549
thank you

883
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:13,549
