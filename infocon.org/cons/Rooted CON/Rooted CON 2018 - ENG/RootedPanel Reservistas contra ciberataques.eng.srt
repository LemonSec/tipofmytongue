1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
I've routed dot-com by the way we are

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:16,190
delighted to be here this is a beautiful

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:18,859
event so will not open time for a debate

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,449
reservists against cyberattacks

5
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:26,010
patriotic collaboration to state costs

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:30,019
as you probably know a few months ago an

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,019
initiative was published in the press

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,740
at that time it was assumed that it was

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:45,290
the popular party in Spain came up with

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:47,510
the initiative to organize a group of

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:54,290
cyber reservists and that's how they

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:57,379
were called to be honest the details and

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:01,839
our initiative we don't know anything

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:04,100
about yet this is in a very early stage

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,690
okay in other countries they've been

16
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:11,000
doing they've been doing these things

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:14,740
for quite some time but anyway this has

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,740
hit the headlines several times

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,560
on whether they should there should be a

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,408
fee of whether these people should get

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,969
money in exchange for the services how

22
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,130
they should be organized

23
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:33,649
what sort of duties they should carry

24
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,350
out and so on and so forth so in order

25
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:39,380
to talk about this topic we have

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,928
organized this roundtable and we have a

27
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:46,009
number of exceptional guests in our

28
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:52,989
medical order Rahman has reminded me to

29
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:56,090
do so Adolfo Fernandez in the red jumper

30
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:58,399
co-founder of cybersecurity is a

31
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,099
think-tank is an extraordinary

32
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,409

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:36,910
initiative on cyber reservists we have

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,910
another guest good afternoon

56
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,139

Complutense University of Madrid he has

66
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,019
been working on cyber security for a

67
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:16,940
long time he leads he's in charge of

68
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,070
they keep ecology laboratory in that

69

it carries out assessments for people

72
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,480
working in this field and last but not

73
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:37,680
least we have ROM and Ramirez he was

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:42,580
co-founder a member of the leading team

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,810
that Kahn a wise man someone that knows

76
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,810
a lot about these things

77
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,510
and let me introduce you to my colleague

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:00,780
miss Fernandez who is the editor of the

79
00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:04,400
SiC magazine he will be moderating this

80
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,400
debate with me

81
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:12,319
we have agreed to have all of them

82
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:17,649
speaking very briefly for three or four

83
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,649
minutes to tell us about the initiative

84
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,609
what's hyper reservists and by the way

85
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,979
let me introduce a minor change I think

86
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:33,300
the first person that should speak is

87
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:36,810
Carlos the general I think you're the

88
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,720
most suitable panelists to tell us where

89
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,750
we are where we stand and based on your

90
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,139
comments define the scope this is a

91
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:50,400
first surprise good afternoon everyone

92
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:58,080
I hope you can hear me it is a pleasure

93
00:05:50,400 --> 00:06:02,638
to be here with all of you I'll be using

94
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,849
my time we known as you give you some

95
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,680
context some references these are my

96
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:13,380
ideas by the way okay this is my opinion

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,669
and the most interesting thing here I'm

98
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,669
sure will be the debate itself

99
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,469
the concept of cypher yourself I like it

100
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,210
it's a good idea without its

101
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,810
difficulties no without its challenges

102
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,120
of course in order to ensure that it is

103
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,539
effective and useful we need to ensure

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,840
that it is properly organized the first

105
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:45,060
thing I'll do is to perhaps change the

106
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:49,229
title for this round table so that I can

107
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,539
convey the first message it's dead off

108
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:54,630
or first Simon reservists against

109
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,820
cyberattacks patriotic collaboration to

110
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,909
save costs I would suggest another title

111
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,639
which is similar reservists against

112
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:07,410
cyberattacks patriotic collaboration in

113
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:10,470
case of crisis that's how I would choose

114
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:16,740
my title three aspects I would like to

115
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:20,610
focus on first of all what do we need

116
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,990
that cyber reserved for secondly how we

117
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:29,539
could organize such a thing and finally

118
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,539
how we would pay the cyber reservists

119
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,219
I'll be very brief I'll just give you

120
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,930
the key elements in my opinion so why do

121
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,729
we need the same of reserve to start

122
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,770
with it is very important to be aware of

123
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:46,349
a fact this cyber reserve is not a

124
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,620
replacement for resources that must be

125
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:51,060
there on a permanent basis there are

126
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,849
resources I'm not going to tell you

127
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,289
about the size there is a set of

128
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,940
resources that must be there all the

129
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,530
time

130
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,870
cyber the cyber retire from my point of

131
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,049
view is a complement to those resources

132
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,720
in case of a crisis

133
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:10,380
so this is not for daily duties or daily

134
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,470
operations this is to account for

135
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,780
extraordinary events those events for

136
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:21,790
which existing resources are not enough

137
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:24,039
or are not suitable no need to say that

138
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,110
in order to ensure that the cyber

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,390
reserve is effective especially in cases

140
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:33,490
a crisis hits when almost nothing works

141
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,400
it is essential it is essential to be

142
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,919
trained during so-called normal periods

143
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,079
so that's the answer to the question why

144
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:47,560
do we need decided reserve how can we

145
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:49,840
organize this allow me to say from my

146
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,949
point of view a hybrid approach is the

147
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,470
best approach part of the cyber reserved

148
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,950
would be comprised of professional

149
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:05,440
military personnel and part of the cyber

150
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:09,100
reserve would be civilians some ideas

151
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,830
from me in a few minutes you know for

152
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,080
well the cyberspace is all about

153
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:18,880
operations ok it's the fifth domain in

154
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,330
operations what do we do we plan we lead

155
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,920
and we execute operations in cyberspace

156
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:27,040
when talking about executing operations

157
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,390
I would use cyber reservists who are

158
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,709
military personnel for the rest it

159
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,069
doesn't really matter whether the

160
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:40,590
military personnel or civilians for

161
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,590
everything else there is a huge area

162
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,780
when we talk about military and civilian

163
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:53,080
reservists we need to ensure that all of

164
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:55,209
them have the corresponding security

165
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,540
accreditation at different levels

166
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,400
depending on their profiles and then

167
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,800
talking about military and civilian

168
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,470
personnel we need several things we need

169
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,229
to meet several requirements we need a

170
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:12,700
recruitment process in place we need a

171
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:16,810
training period we need an activation

172
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:22,080
whenever a corresponds and a regular

173
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,079
updating of the training they receive

174
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,120
for those of you who know about the

175
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:32,319
voluntary cyber reservists in the Armed

176
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:41,250
Forces the differences are and must

177
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:41,250
indeed be very big wines because

178
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:52,460
the physical abilities are not very

179
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:56,560
important not very sensual the services

180
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,560
to be delivered by other reservists

181
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:06,010
could be delivered online they don't

182
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,680
necessarily have to be there physically

183
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:13,610
the training period will extend for a

184
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:18,500
shorter duration and the activation

185
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:21,340
procedure would be much quicker just to

186
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,440
give you a hint on the basic differences

187
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:27,590
how would we organize a cyber reserve I

188
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,140
know it may sound obvious but we need to

189
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:32,510
do this in a progressive manner

190
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:36,560
step-by-step we would define an initial

191
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:38,720
call of specialists we would define a

192
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,699
basic set of procedures will then

193
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,910
validate those procedures and that would

194
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:47,000
allow us to grow in an orderly manner

195
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:51,430
and last but not least how we pay how

196
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,430
was the compensate deciphers reservists

197
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:01,350
I'm not contemplating really either we

198
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,750
would pay them a salary and obviously we

199
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,980
cannot expect that we can compete with

200
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:11,060
private companies head-on some food for

201
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,080
thought for me what could we do for the

202
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,609
compensations were obviously covering

203
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,920
their expenses and covering many other

204
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,590
things and I think there are many

205
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,510
potential things where we're good that

206
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,850
we could use to compensate them for

207
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,770
example through trainings what I want to

208
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:30,120
make really clear is that from my point

209
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:33,660
of view it doesn't make any sense to

210
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,300
include cyber reservists in our armed

211
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,410
forces as personnel thank you so much

212
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:44,510
thank you Carlos

213
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,510
so we now go back to the initial order

214
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:53,430
so first of all I would like to thank

215
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:57,660
the organizers for letting us share this

216
00:12:53,430 --> 00:13:01,229
space I'll be very brief and the things

217
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:05,670
I will mention will relate to what I was

218
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,740
mentioned two years ago along the lines

219
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,550
of the comments made better general we

220
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,160
from from cyber don't want to take full

221
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:17,699
credit for opening a debate on this but

222
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,949
back then in 2014 in April 2014 we

223
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,050
started talking about the initiatives

224
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:28,110
and cyber reserves in other country

225
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:30,000
especially within NATO we came up with

226
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,440
our own model for Simon Fuller cyber

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,040
reserve we believed that there was

228
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,270
necessary

229
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:39,599
I have to say we have stuck to the same

230
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,910
idea we came up with back then in 2014

231
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,200
he had to be a non military or a pillow

232
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,650
or not a purely military cyber reserve

233
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:52,980
we have analyzed where they've done in

234
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:55,770
estonia bestonia is a very peculiar

235
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,720
country a very small country

236
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,120
sometimes success in other countries can

237
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,940
not be extrapolated directly to our

238
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,220
reality we have analyzed the situation

239
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:10,600
in France and the UK in Israel in the

240
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,190
u.s. these are very different cases and

241
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,440
you cannot expect to extrapolate them

242
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:18,970
directly those initiatives in those

243
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,310
countries are in the early stages so we

244
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,590
don't know yet we don't have any

245
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:28,329
indicators to know whether they've been

246
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:31,270
successful France is one of our major

247
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:35,670
neighbours the French have a different

248
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:38,829
degree of maturity so we don't know yet

249
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:42,579
but we have seen failures keys to

250
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:46,390
failing in those approaches and we've

251
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:52,930
seen that a fully military approach to

252
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:56,080
cyber reserves it's a mistake so we are

253
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,640
not talking about technical profiles we

254
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,550
are talking about different profiles

255
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,980
across operating this approach so

256
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,050
therefore what we propose we propose to

257
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,330
each and every one of you is to create

258
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,880
something of our own

259
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:12,040
based on Spanish reality based on the

260
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,680
model of morality that we have in this

261
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,390
country considering the level of

262
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,930
confrontation in the public

263
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:23,199
administrations so therefore now that

264
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:25,930
this has gained some momentum and this

265
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,660
has been widely I was strongly catalyzed

266
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,209
because of that's here because of wanna

267
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,480
cry and it has also gained some

268
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:39,130
political momentum which is different to

269
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:42,130
the taking our time and deciding what to

270
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:44,800
do I'd like to launch a question to all

271
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:47,020
of you are we in the right time - yeah

272
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,620
we believe we strongly believe that we

273
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,770
need a cyber reserve but not at any cost

274
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:57,490
not at any expense because this is a one

275
00:15:53,770 --> 00:16:00,280
bullet game and then if we can waste our

276
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,450
game because at the end of the day these

277
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:07,030
reserves it's a voluntary

278
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:11,140
from all of us so we just don't want you

279
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:13,240
to make a mistake and to get it wrong so

280
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,520
with this I mean that everyone should be

281
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,340
in line political forces the

282
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,069
administration and the cyber reservists

283
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:24,100
we should all be aligned in this project

284
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,940
and brick' please good afternoon

285
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,030
everyone

286
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,700
thank you for giving us the opportunity

287
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:34,540
to share part of this story with you

288
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:39,390
story there has been in the media and

289
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:43,120
because of that has created confusion

290
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:45,910
and especially to those of us who carry

291
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,480
out our activities in the cyberspace so

292
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:52,150
it is known as resurface strategy of

293
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,450
talents in cyber defense and cyber

294
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:58,449
security this is not a minor idea that

295
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:02,320
four people came to us about drinking

296
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:04,959
beer so highly qualified people have

297
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,290
been working on this idea for many years

298
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,939
and they have operational and tactical

299
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:19,589
and strategic experience in this matter

300
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:19,589
why did we decide to present this

301
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:28,569
regulatory aspects well I'll give you

302
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,270
good news our democracy sometimes works

303
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:34,510
so we thought that it was the right time

304
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,879
and the right place to do it we say we

305
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:39,610
either do it now or never

306
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,610
at any cost no of course not not at any

307
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,250
cost but at a cost we are ready to pay

308
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:49,179
for and then assuming that in the

309
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,950
cyberspace domain we you have to make

310
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,290
mistakes you have to make mistakes and

311
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,150
you have to put tools in place to make

312
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,220
progress as fun as possible this is the

313
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:00,610
same as businesses if I create a

314
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:04,870
wonderful poster and this is being sold

315
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:07,629
on Amazon the main research on the US

316
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:11,350
then local government

317
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:13,930
the success of my poster Oh front page

318
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,070
and they are copying it and doing the

319
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,290
same thing okay they are being

320
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,050
prosecuted investigated for tasks so

321
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,899
this is what we believe why we believe

322
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:25,210
that this is the right time and place

323
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:28,600
for us to do it I'm going to learn to

324
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,250
this question two questions so the

325
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,919
states as long as we want to keep that

326
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,260
up and as long as there is no

327
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,020
alternative cannot compete in a global

328
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:41,680
market of talents so we cannot access

329
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:45,160
not even by law so that market of

330
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,750
talents and we have talent resources but

331
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,570
they are also in the market

332
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:53,500
my professional salary is published in

333
00:18:49,570 --> 00:19:00,060
the Official Gazette and does not match

334
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:02,980
up with the salary that is being paid to

335
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:06,429
colleague working in the private

336
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:09,030
industry so my question is how can we

337
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:12,150
attract first level specialized talent

338
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:15,480
because we are talking about multiple

339
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,630
discipline talent multidisciplinary

340
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,930
talents

341
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:25,090
so this cyberspace is multi-dimensional

342
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,810
and we have to assume it as such and the

343
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,429
same as our national defense strategy

344
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,770
security strategy says we have to defend

345
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,680
it and we'll have to defend it with all

346
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:38,080
the weapons available to us as long as

347
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,020
we want to defend it so that's my first

348
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,919
question and the second question is

349
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:47,620
about the need that we as a civil

350
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,370
society participate in the defense of

351
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,979
our nation

352
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:57,669
as our Constitution reads our

353
00:19:50,980 --> 00:20:00,940
Constitution is there for us to use it

354
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:02,800
and to collaborate with it and it is

355
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,550
also a good

356
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,399
traction allowing civil society to

357
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:13,700
participate in the defense through

358
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:16,850
preservation and through the strategic

359
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,800
reserves reserve of talents so these are

360
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:23,300
the two conditions that we took into

361
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:31,180
account when we developed regulatory

362
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:34,159
text and we selected the Seavey's of how

363
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:37,520
well that we thought that were feeling

364
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:43,370
and put it forward to the political

365
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:50,620
groups that were willing to sit down

366
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:55,129
with us so as I say they told us they

367
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:57,919
directed us to the party in government

368
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,140
if you really want to have success when

369
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,320
you launch a standard a regulation you

370
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:07,880
have to address the political party in

371
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:11,720
government so this is not a party

372
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,130
oriented initiative but we just thought

373
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,650
that it was the right time the right

374
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,630
place to do it the people who

375
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,240
participated in the project and great

376
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:23,090
experts in this matter and I'd like to

377
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,640
clarify on the following point so we

378
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,580
have asked for the necessary resources

379
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,940
to bring it forward because in this

380
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:35,840
country we tend to make policies okay

381
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:39,650
with clause that says with no cost

382
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,840
increase or with no expense increase

383
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,180
because all the public policies have

384
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,179
associate cost associated to them and

385
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,700
expense associated to it and it is true

386
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,230
and we are aware of it and hopefully it

387
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,140
will come out in the following debate

388
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,000
that I hope they will be very lively so

389
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,200
these processes of problems of

390
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,200
coordination and

391
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:07,179
problems because we are embarking or

392
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,129
going into an export territory we didn't

393
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,779
do that before we are going to make

394
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:13,418
mistakes and we're going to learn from

395
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:15,940
our mistakes not making mistakes in the

396
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:20,340
cyberspace it's a risk and as well as a

397
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,340
threat so thank you very much

398
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:32,509
hello good afternoon drawing on what all

399
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,090
these speakers I mentioned I also would

400
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:42,860
like to change the title of this

401
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:45,439
proposal as general said reservists what

402
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:50,709
I would have changed would have liked to

403
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,710
change the name and to say volunteers

404
00:22:51,249 --> 00:23:01,730
not a silver cost per volunteers who get

405
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:03,559
money and reward whenever they fulfill

406
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:07,999
their mission but they accomplish their

407
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:10,070
mission if we do not comply there if we

408
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:13,039
do not fulfill that promise we will not

409
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:15,139
get anywhere we will not reach our

410
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,869
destination the second point that I

411
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:19,490
would like to mention is that I disagree

412
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:27,399
with has been said that this is not a

413
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:35,029
one bullet shot we have to grow

414
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:36,979
exponentially or vertically we have to

415
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:39,350
start off with a core we have to gain

416
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:43,159
experience and we have to take it from

417
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:46,070
there and to keep growing as general

418
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:50,629
mentioned the objective of cyber reserve

419
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:53,749
is to identify silent if people people

420
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:57,199
with expertise in some capabilities but

421
00:23:53,749 --> 00:24:01,009
it is cyberattacks have defense forensic

422
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,549
analysis reverse engineering to hire

423
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:09,559
them and to hire them whenever we need

424
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:12,279
them and to hire them on a flexible

425
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:14,928
basis because these people will have to

426
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:18,590
feed themselves and they will have to

427
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:21,440
press family and we will want to not to

428
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:24,790
forget about that so I see some lack of

429
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,220
maturity nowadays

430
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:31,060
in terms of the horizontal services that

431
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:33,880
are being provided by the government so

432
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:39,429
to absorb these cyber reserves and to

433
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:41,490
use it properly I think we need places

434
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:46,420
for these people to sit down and

435
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:50,680
profiles that we can apply most of these

436
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:52,570
cyber security services are based in

437
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:56,620
departments by this and we will have

438
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:59,649
horizontal services of cyber security

439
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:03,340
not only Madrid but also in the bridges

440
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:07,030
of his pain surely will be of will be

441
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:09,399
more widely implemented so haha now you

442
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:12,870
have the floor good afternoon everyone

443
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:16,410
I will try to change the discourse

444
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:21,929
slightly I would like to start off by

445
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:21,930
separating cyber defence from cyber

446
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:30,190
decide so we have organized groups

447
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:32,890
shooting everything walking dead model

448
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:36,910
and some white supremacists from Ohio

449
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:39,370
then the second mode George Bush and

450
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:42,520
Cheney and colleagues am going to set up

451
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:45,179
a war I'm going to outsource it and to

452
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,650
make money out of the Iraq war the

453
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,690
Americans put the money and the attack

454
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:53,500
is put their life and then the third

455
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:56,200
mode which is more European Swiss model

456
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,760
more civilized world is they admit that

457
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:03,040
at some occasions sometimes may need

458
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,490
citizens to defend the equity the

459
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,450
structures the values that are shared by

460
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:13,090
all and then these people are mobilized

461
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,930
well the out of the three movements the

462
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:19,020
most civilized one is the third one

463
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:21,960
that is to say if needed people will be

464
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,879
mobilized externalizing defense that is

465
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,880
to say to pay the free prices of the

466
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,270
market will lead to black border to

467
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,750
Cheney set up and then the first model

468
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,430
of shooting everything around you will

469
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,670
demolish will end up with everything in

470
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:41,490
few more minutes so therefore there is

471
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:45,090
not much choice and then there comes a

472
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:48,090
time that we've we have to well if there

473
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:51,000
is need to use the reserve perhaps that

474
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,909
reserve will not be this will not be

475
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,400
something that voluntary so I don't

476
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,890
really see the temporarily given to this

477
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,630
if this is necessary especially this

478
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:08,940
time of crisis so reservists produce

479
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:13,590
whenever Katrina took a toll on so many

480
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:16,170
people where we need reservists to come

481
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,629
back to normality as soon as possible

482
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:22,140
but in cyberspace to turn to things like

483
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:28,920
that I just don't need thousand men

484
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:33,420
unless but to stop any attack so defense

485
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,970
is proactive it's not reactive what is

486
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:39,120
reactive attack is reactive and now let

487
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:44,370
us move on to the second part that I

488
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,989
announced cyberattack so in a democratic

489
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,389
system cyberattack has been transferred

490
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,740
to a very specific characters without

491
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,380
the Armed Forces

492
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:55,200
and then in this case is civilians do

493
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,360
not really make sense services man wants

494
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,500
to push the red button it is his

495
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,559
responsibility

496
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:05,309
none of us and not allowed by the

497
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:07,080
Constitution to think about that second

498
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,660
characteristics and I said well they

499
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,030
cannot has manufactured this attack no

500
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:17,210
no no no deaths are known as weapon

501
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:20,700
manufacturers if you want to set up a

502
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:22,710
place such as haka team and then to put

503
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,630
in the market digital weapons you will

504
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,720
be treated as an individual who is

505
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:30,690
manufacturing missiles they are closely

506
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,020
monitored they paid enough lots of money

507
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:36,780
and then that's it so if we do that we

508
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:40,050
have not invented absolutely anything

509
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:44,730
so actually reserved ISM does not really

510
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:47,610
fit in to me in the digital world in the

511
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:51,530
digital world I just don't understand I

512
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,530
don't understand reservists

513
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:01,480
okay so the debate was not started yet

514
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,480
so number one

515
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,410
when I was more hostile than I am now

516
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,540
actually I very much like Carlos

517
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,220
arguments because I understood since

518
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,629
that perhaps was not understanding

519
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,810
before I'm going to ask you a question

520
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,540
are you aware of Westphalia peace do you

521
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:23,330
know how the modern democratic order

522
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,080
works so you will know who has the

523
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:28,970
capacity to access power outside the

524
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,730
borders of the countries and within the

525
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:34,760
borders of the country DARPA scientists

526
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,480
European countries were tired of killing

527
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,270
each other

528
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,910
they decided to set up rules to build a

529
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,100
modern state I would like to launch an

530
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:47,420
open question if you are in the street

531
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:50,209
and then proper as actually with the

532
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:53,780
knife so who do you think do you think

533
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:56,630
that the law enforcement agencies are to

534
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:59,270
defend you when that happens to you if

535
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:02,000
you are do your staircase and you are

536
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,980
drunk and then someone tries to steal

537
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,570
your water from you who do you think

538
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,220
should be responsible to defend you

539
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,899
press your hands up sue think that law

540
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,510
enforcement ideally should do that if

541
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,220
there is a wall and people are to be

542
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,470
sent to Afghanistan who should go to

543
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,780
Afghanistan raise your hands or to think

544
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:21,620
that these are the military okay

545
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:23,660
and now why in the case of Salva we

546
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:27,020
companies and citizens have to do that

547
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:29,870
why law enforcement agencies are not

548
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:34,400
defending me against cyber attacks made

549
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:39,260
by individual profits individual wine no

550
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,150
the military are not defending me in the

551
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,190
case of cyber war and why private

552
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,710
companies or private individuals will

553
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:49,370
have to do that and the question what

554
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:52,850
the hell civilians doing in military or

555
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:55,310
no enforcement of policy environment so

556
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:57,500
creating this figure has a dangerous

557
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,960
consequence that is to say to open up

558
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:03,980
the door to the abuse of the capacities

559
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,200
and the talent that you have for on the

560
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,300
part of people who have a very specific

561
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,120
function and

562
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,820
respect them you know what who a comrade

563
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,889
is do you know how can you address a

564
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,080
person as a comrade you can only say

565
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:21,010
comrade to a person who has been

566
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:25,480
shooting in war on your behalf

567
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:29,530
has been there like in a battle with you

568
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,990
so to me the military and the forces of

569
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:35,820
the state are my comrades because they

570
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:40,330
are fighting in the cyber domain and

571
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:44,710
actually but I very much respect this

572
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:47,470
function so we have to spoil the

573
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:53,410
military function the police function by

574
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:55,690
having in turn doing black ops dual

575
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,520
agencies will have free service for

576
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,710
black operations for intelligence

577
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:03,160
operations we will have reservists in

578
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:06,490
the legal side military lawyers will be

579
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:10,240
supported by a private law firm this is

580
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:14,250
very complex and I absolutely share what

581
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,960
El busto said this is a one-shot game

582
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:19,990
how many of you will go happily to

583
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,710
Afghanistan to be charged now for Spain

584
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:26,770
raise your hand so you are facing a

585
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:30,370
cultural issue of this country so I

586
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:35,320
don't believe in the concept of flag and

587
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:39,659
of Patras so I want to defend my

588
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:43,659
neighborhood I want my children to have

589
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:48,220
good jobs and if that entails taking a

590
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:51,280
project from US companies I will do it

591
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,650
that has nothing to do with me patriot

592
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,320
but it has to do with defending your

593
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:58,900
community because as we are here to die

594
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,178
defending a community the reservists

595
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,240
collaboration first of all you have to

596
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:07,660
convince these people like a thousand

597
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,299
people to collaborate in many other

598
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:17,100
things under the concept of

599
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:19,769
community instead of the country and how

600
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,719
are we going to compensate companies how

601
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:25,499
are you going to compensate companies

602
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:28,820
for for instance if you've had I belong

603
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:31,830
in SIA is it's also good idea to

604
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,509
volunteer for 3 months ok to go away for

605
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:37,999
3 months how are you going to compensate

606
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:37,999
and reward companies for that

607
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:48,110
okay so do you have hurt everyone so I

608
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:50,870
don't know whether you are sitting on

609
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:53,570
the right bench no no this is not a

610
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:57,219
clash so this is something which is very

611
00:33:53,570 --> 00:34:00,470
important which is known as generating

612
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:03,279
collective intelligence so all the ideas

613
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:06,559
that can be put on the table already

614
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:08,659
valuable supper actually the only thing

615
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,790
that is not valid is to put on the table

616
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,679
destructive ideas without providing an

617
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,960
alternative solution are you telling

618
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:18,379
that on me none of them is saying that

619
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,449
are you so on and saying if actually if

620
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:22,929
everyone assumes that there is a threat

621
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:25,489
so we will have to put on the table

622
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:27,679
solutions possible solutions or

623
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:29,750
solutions we can think of but but to

624
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,460
open up this debate this dialogue what

625
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,699
is the threat we don't have enough

626
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:38,649
talent to support the military cyber

627
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:44,210
defense is there a shortage of talents

628
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:45,500
so what we have reserved so in the open

629
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,589
question that I asked in the beginning

630
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,629
is includes part of the problem that

631
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:55,609
being do we have enough talent there is

632
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:59,990
never enough talent is it necessary or

633
00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:02,900
could we understood that this could be

634
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:05,149
the backbone of the cyber defense of our

635
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,700
nation not at all no one has said that

636
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:10,880
actually general was very clear about

637
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:14,118
that this would only work in crisis

638
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,750
situations crisis situations in the

639
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:20,270
cyber space are of different nature may

640
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:24,050
be of different nature they may unfold

641
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:26,000
over time and moreover if we assume that

642
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:29,119
we will find lots of black stones

643
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,690
because it is a black about black swans

644
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,430
so only if a given point in time you

645
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,160
know what their talent is you will be in

646
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,220
a position to give a response this is my

647
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,220
view

648
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,010
this may be their this may be will

649
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:51,160
develop some we have most likely to make

650
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:54,040
to get it wrong but it is best to get it

651
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:57,220
wrong to learn from this and to reassess

652
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:00,160
what we did and that perhaps with a

653
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:03,700
llamas to give the right response in the

654
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,759
face of a crisis situation general would

655
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:08,919
you like to say something

656
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,570
well I'd like to say two things starting

657
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,520
off by what we mentioned last I have to

658
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:20,890
make mistake of course we have to make

659
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:23,259
mistakes undoubtedly but we have to make

660
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,900
mistakes in a controlled manner we

661
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,020
cannot make mistakes in a irreversible

662
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,020
manner

663
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,200
this is a process for having an

664
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,270
initiative checking that that initiative

665
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,540
whether the initiative works or not if

666
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:42,550
it works we move ahead we move on and if

667
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,970
not we corrected but I insist in a

668
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,970
controlled manner

669
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:56,170
so I'd like someone from the public to

670
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:59,558
clarify for me these exceptional

671
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,420
situations that would require bring it

672
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:04,059
together all the silence in this country

673
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:08,230
I'm against it oh actually I don't feel

674
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:11,950
that this is a battle of some black

675
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:14,859
swans this is take out silent contest

676
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:18,939
this is not about who's got the biggest

677
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:22,690
hacker that if I have something which is

678
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:24,460
not working please do not use it so

679
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:28,450
defense is a different thing attack is

680
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,940
about who's got biggest muscle defense

681
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:34,359
is should be proactive we have to make

682
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,400
our systems being defensible and you

683
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:40,499
don't achieve that overnight this is the

684
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:44,470
result of long-standing and sustained

685
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:46,328
activity so there could be exceptions in

686
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,269
the attacks so for instance if we are

687
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:52,299
talking about taking out our attack

688
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:54,669
talents to launch the other attack

689
00:37:52,299 --> 00:38:00,329
talents okay I just withdraw because I

690
00:37:54,670 --> 00:38:00,329
don't like tv5 the Spanish TV 5 channel

691
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,530
when we were putting together as we

692
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:18,990
approach of this session

693
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:23,390
the rider responds so what was desired I

694
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:27,180
just want to focus on the second part

695
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:28,859
patriotic elaboration to save costs I'd

696
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,180
like to ask question to Carlos in

697
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,520
representation of the ministry for

698
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,259
defence Navi Araz representative of the

699
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:41,450
public administration which is the

700
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:41,450
following Spain

701
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,690
has enough resources and capabilities to

702
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:53,140
face up to the challenges of the 21st

703
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:59,650
century or perhaps Spain doesn't have

704
00:38:53,140 --> 00:39:02,230
those resources and perhaps may have to

705
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:06,180
use additional arguments to kind of

706
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:13,480
offset that lack of resources that was

707
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:15,490
shown the fact that now says well we

708
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,920
don't have a cybersecurity Center for

709
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:20,790
the general administration of the state

710
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,800
of resisted the bread distribution or

711
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:27,520
reallocation of the Ministry of Defense

712
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:31,390
in all the its demand in the 21st

713
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:37,570
century your competence

714
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:39,430
it is infra served or underserved do we

715
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,750
have enough resources if we have enough

716
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,210
resources perhaps with the near

717
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:46,710
volunteers where we really have it we

718
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,710
see the subterfuge or not

719
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,040
I'd like to answer

720
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:04,980
well there is never enough okay we never

721
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:07,410
have enough it is true but we can say if

722
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,500
we cannot just really go to a maximum

723
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,870
policy could have faced up to any thing

724
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,200
that may happen but we cannot just stay

725
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:18,509
or keep a minimum policy that would not

726
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,339
allow us to respond to anything so the

727
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:24,170
way I see it is like to have some

728
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:27,630
resources on stuff resolving a high

729
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:32,700
percentage high number of situations and

730
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:34,560
then if we go to extreme situations to

731
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:38,520
face up to touch the screen situations

732
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,920
it is anti-economic that's when I are

733
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,170
ringing with the title it is not it goes

734
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:49,740
against economy to have all those

735
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:52,160
resources on our stuff ok so this is my

736
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,160
idea

737
00:40:54,870 --> 00:41:01,020
so I don't think it is a question of

738
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:04,620
resources I stayed has budget and we

739
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:07,710
depend on that budget and then what we

740
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:12,020
have to do is just to see what do we

741
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:15,690
want to invest the third party around so

742
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:18,930
when everyone says that cyber threat is

743
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,520
very important but perhaps the budget is

744
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:26,549
being spent somewhere else

745
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:29,490
I tell would like to talk about so I'd

746
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:35,910
like to say something so I don't see

747
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:37,709
that situation for crisis situation what

748
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,990
happens with wanna cry we all call

749
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:42,780
people over Friday and then on Sunday

750
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:45,209
things are over so I have to work with

751
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:48,360
whatever it's available to me so cyber

752
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:51,150
reserves is a procedure to detect

753
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:53,070
silence and where the administration can

754
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,740
select these people and invite them to

755
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:58,440
say and I'm going to go I will go

756
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,600
against Roman and I will tell him that

757
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,240
there are many people that do many

758
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,880
things for the nation do many things for

759
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,850
in Spain and France they are ready to

760
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,190
spend to devote two or three months of

761
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:17,190
their life so that we can assess the

762
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:21,780
capability their skills and to listen to

763
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,910
the offer that we make to them it's not

764
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:30,050
a question of resources state has those

765
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:35,250
resources but it is true that we have to

766
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:38,910
be able to what those who have to ask me

767
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:44,120
those newly priority people we just want

768
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:46,440
to detect him best profiles for that

769
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,839
general gave an example I agree if

770
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,800
another one so regarding stretched

771
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,800
vulnerability

772
00:42:52,180 --> 00:43:02,259
so we had many trouble in many entities

773
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:08,980
and we would have needed people experts

774
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:12,610
with in Linux Apache service helping the

775
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:15,820
public service to go back to operation

776
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:18,310
so this is an example if we had those

777
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:21,040
profiles identified we could have used

778
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:23,170
them we are not we were not humming a

779
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,380
company's because that took place in the

780
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:29,580
weekends but anyway we had to reward

781
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:34,710
them for having given us those

782
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:40,450
additional hours of work ok I answer and

783
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:44,410
certain of with the strats it's truth so

784
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:47,350
some people here detected vulnerable

785
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:49,569
sites to the administration they

786
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:53,020
reported it through routed and through

787
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:56,070
other well through civil cards and that

788
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:59,470
works and it is already up and running

789
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:01,360
do we need that to be regulated for any

790
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,600
politician to have a place in the Senate

791
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,980
oh sorry I said that out loud and I just

792
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,810
had it on my mind so you are talking

793
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,240
about reporting vulnerabilities we have

794
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:11,799
that already okay we have whenever it is

795
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,709
reported through very many different

796
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,840
channels yes but the problem is going

797
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,310
there and fixing that vulnerability but

798
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,750
don't you think the administration

799
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:22,600
should have qualified people supported

800
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:24,670
the system paying them a bright salary

801
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,680
decent salary perman happens when the

802
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,690
crisis comes in and then the problem

803
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,270
arrives and then you need you have a

804
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,920
shortage of hands and as I say if you

805
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:36,070
don't have those hands available as

806
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:39,510
confessor we just recruit them on a

807
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:43,270
voluntary basis and we will pay them

808
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,920
good money well we just would like to

809
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:49,150
clarify what you want a reservist for

810
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,380
for defense if caucus that are before if

811
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:53,050
that will have to do lots of

812
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,730
preventative security you have to train

813
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:57,010
them beforehand but if you are talking

814
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,910
about identifying talent talent in work

815
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,869
in

816
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:05,140
King into fire firewall rules were

817
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:06,940
exploiting us Danny another we talk

818
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,009
about ROP that is not offensive that is

819
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,109
offensive and though they saw a trend on

820
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:14,380
a party committees and if we talk about

821
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:15,940
that I find that really are setting in

822
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,950
terms of the relationship between the

823
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:19,150
military and the private world the world

824
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,970
of private companies which is

825
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:23,770
mercenaries reservists will not spend

826
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,538
four months investigating exploits

827
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:28,420
that's impossible and you know that

828
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:33,190
perfectly well at the end of the day

829
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:36,339
we'll have to find companies of that

830
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:37,809
type because the military I respect and

831
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:39,700
I admire them because they have a

832
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:45,059
commitment or with my country when the

833
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:45,058
mercenaries my feelings are not the same

834
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:50,490
so be aware of that mercenaries

835
00:45:51,680 --> 00:46:00,960
time goes by and I would like to take

836
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:04,920
the opportunity to ask for examples on

837
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:09,150
how the cyber reserve us it has been

838
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:14,970
posed in Spain it is actually it is

839
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:18,089
currently a draft the draft law how that

840
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,919
could be articulated with you but the

841
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:25,710
companies and with the government of

842
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:27,990
Spain this is just an exercise that we

843
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:34,619
are on the same page and we understand

844
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:36,450
exactly what this all means there is

845
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:38,550
this misleading interpretation the main

846
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:40,439
goal for this act as a reserve is not

847
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:43,589
hiring it's not recruiting people to

848
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,170
launch cyber attacks the cyber reserve

849
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:51,540
will be active at times of war under

850
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:56,270
times of peace at times of peace they

851
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:56,270
will be operational support basically

852
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:02,990
so if you're expecting to join the cyber

853
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:06,620
reserve to launch a DDoS attack on North

854
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:09,049
Korea forget about it can you give us

855
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:11,540
examples those things that of cases

856
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:13,280
you've seen in recent months about how

857
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:16,759
this hard Cyber Reserve should be

858
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,860
activated could be activated have you

859
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,030
heard about an events that could we

860
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,030
could use as lessons learned

861
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:34,280
oh man by the way let me tell the

862
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:38,299
audience please go ahead with your

863
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:41,330
questions okay okay with panic cry a lot

864
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:44,540
for do you remember the involvement in

865
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:48,110
the Spanish government the set up record

866
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:52,820
and they set up a coordination team and

867
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:54,890
I don't mean the CCN that was working

868
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:57,260
hard from 9:00 in the morning on that

869
00:47:54,890 --> 00:48:02,509
day but remember who is pushing for that

870
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:06,050
Rapid Response Team there was no one

871
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:08,990
there was no one there we had to call

872
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:13,880
upon primary individuals so that they

873
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:15,490
could form a group the only contacts the

874
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,530
only call I got from the public

875
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:22,299
administration was a phone call to ask

876
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:25,370
me were they happy to get happy about

877
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:27,170
whatever had been impacted this was

878
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:30,859
through a telegram group believe it or

879
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:33,640
not it was it's a bit sad we have some

880
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,640
questions already

881
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,670
I'm the mercenary Roman is afraid of I

882
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:46,400
descend from several people that have

883
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,810
been working on weapon development at

884
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,230
Santa Barbara the National weapon

885
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:53,660
company have seen all sorts of things

886
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:55,910
there's two things you mentioned talent

887
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:58,490
retention and cost savings one of the

888
00:48:55,910 --> 00:49:02,720
worst things I always saw in my military

889
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:05,868
career is that you reward a nice time

890
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,819
better than Talent why are you not doing

891
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:11,630
anything to change that and on

892
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:14,119
cost-savings the army works with many

893
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:17,599
different private companies with tallies

894
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:24,230
with intra military with a pass defense

895
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:28,550
and space GFI and many others and I see

896
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:29,840
the in many of these companies some

897
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:32,630
people come from the ministry and are

898
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:36,410
appointed in very high positions we also

899
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:44,330
have a miss miss hospitals husband

900
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:46,399
working as a CEO at amber so instead of

901
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:49,730
rewarding nice ties how about talent

902
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,530
retention and cost savings so that we

903
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:54,280
have enough budget for the side reserve

904
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,280
thank you

905
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,329
was that a question or was that a

906
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:08,990
declaration of intention or a statement

907
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:13,549
I didn't understand the question since

908
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:15,609
I'm also in public office I don't hold a

909
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:19,160
high position and no one in government

910
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:22,190
I'm very proud of what I do but I don't

911
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,960
I don't hold high positions I work for

912
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:26,240
you amongst others with a nice tie I

913
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,430
didn't understand the question if this

914
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:32,899
is a political forum I would agree with

915
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:36,109
that but I don't think we were talking

916
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:38,690
about that because if we manipulate if

917
00:50:36,109 --> 00:50:43,130
we mislead people when talking about

918
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:45,170
these subjects we'll get into something

919
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:47,500
which is very special very unique in

920
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,500
Spain

921
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:56,420
which is that attitude let us attack any

922
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,240
ideas without offering alternatives

923
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:03,290
because some things are not working if

924
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:05,930
you and I go for a beer in a while you

925
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:08,810
will see that not only I agree with what

926
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:10,790
you said but probably I have more

927
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:13,009
radical than you are but we were not

928
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:15,830
talking about that we were not talking

929
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:18,080
about that we were talking about

930
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:21,860
professional careers I work for the

931
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,750
Civil Guard professional careers the

932
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:26,710
civil guard are not suitable for the

933
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:29,870
21st century we're working on it yes

934
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:31,760
talent detection programs within the

935
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:34,190
civil guard that was never done in the

936
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:39,050
past we've been forced by circumstances

937
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:40,850
to do those detect talent inside there

938
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,550
are certain people in the civil guard

939
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:45,860
that are not holding the positions they

940
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:48,200
should be in because of their talent and

941
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:50,600
their abilities this is their dynamic

942
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:53,240
thing and we are adapting ourselves to

943
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:56,120
them and we are moving into a new domain

944
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:58,970
we are exploring we're exploring a new

945
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:02,540
domain which has nothing to do with

946
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:06,890
territories which is very dynamic in by

947
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:09,500
nature the subtlety in decision-making

948
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:13,279
processes this is technical not

949
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:16,130
political Roman politicians serve the

950
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,960
state some serve the state unless you

951
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:20,000
don't want to state unless you don't

952
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,550
want to form of democracy in that case

953
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,280
forget about it but politicians in

954
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:27,140
general do serve their country if this

955
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,760
is a political forum let's talk about

956
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,980
politics but we're not talking about

957
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:34,490
politics here we're talking about

958
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:37,010
whether there is a need to have public

959
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:40,040
policies in place which will give us

960
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:42,790
access to certain talent profile so and

961
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:46,520
by the way let us look beyond that

962
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:50,210
because maybe just maybe we could use

963
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:52,970
source certain tools for what we call

964
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:56,240
the positive externalities I see very

965
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:57,629
few women in this forum how about

966
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,200
setting up groups

967
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:05,430
multidisciplinary talented groups to

968
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,558
favor STEM abilities or STEM skills that

969
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:10,410
could be generated by something like

970
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:13,200
cyber defense or perhaps setting of

971
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:15,299
cyber multidisciplinary teams which

972
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,759
would produce a positive impact on our

973
00:53:15,299 --> 00:53:19,829
economy

974
00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:22,079
wiebe says Martha we have been training

975
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,819
the best cohorts of university students

976
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,039
in the last 50 years in Spain and

977
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:28,288
allowed them to leave because you were

978
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:30,480
champions among champions after

979
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:32,220
investing a huge amount of resources in

980
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,589
training the past generations ever in

981
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:40,709
the history of Spain we've allowed them

982
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:45,440
to go abroad to work for other people to

983
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:45,440
work for other countries sorry

984
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:55,640
general do you want to say something

985
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,550
well what I would ask is that we stick

986
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,859
to the subject and I think this is some

987
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:05,089
it is worth that we focus on the topic

988
00:54:00,859 --> 00:54:08,900
we could talk about difficulties in any

989
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:11,560
area in the world but we've come here to

990
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:14,569
talk about the title let me tell you

991
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:19,130
from my point of view from my

992
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:20,569
responsibilities I'm buying away I think

993
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:23,270
the opportunity to respond to a question

994
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:25,759
that was posed before how do we make

995
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:28,670
that talent toil how do we attract that

996
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,569
talent and make it loyal towards our

997
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:35,510
mission ambition how about forgetting

998
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:39,200
those rewards for nice ties going back

999
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:44,150
to the question you posed well my

1000
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:51,279
experience my personal experience which

1001
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:54,130
can be a great tool I think tells me

1002
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:56,529
that this has to make sense people must

1003
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:59,969
understand that this makes sense we must

1004
00:54:56,529 --> 00:55:02,919
reach that reach their hearts secondly

1005
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:06,189
they need to feel that whatever they do

1006
00:55:02,919 --> 00:55:07,379
with us is attractive that whatever they

1007
00:55:06,189 --> 00:55:09,669
do with us

1008
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,630
convinces them that they're using their

1009
00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:16,029
time in a wife manner

1010
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:17,679
the third element would be creating a

1011
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:20,140
wonderful environment for them to work

1012
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:23,109
in money is not the most important thing

1013
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,879
as I said before if we have the ability

1014
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:27,308
to put that into practice and this is

1015
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,419
something I'll I experienced myself all

1016
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:31,659
the time

1017
00:55:28,419 --> 00:55:36,839
our potential for success will be very

1018
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:39,640
reasonable I agree completely with you

1019
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:41,859
and I can assure you that they don't

1020
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,989
move because of money that is not the

1021
00:55:41,859 --> 00:55:47,169
main driver for what they do I'm talking

1022
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:48,369
about respect towards our profession if

1023
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:54,089
you don't allocate the necessary

1024
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:55,869
resources and you expect them to

1025
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:58,089
compensate for a number of limitations

1026
00:55:55,869 --> 00:56:00,339
I'm not saying you have limitations I

1027
00:55:58,089 --> 00:56:04,299
don't know how you are like allocating

1028
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:06,159
your budgets internally it is not that

1029
00:56:04,299 --> 00:56:08,140
they want to have a higher salary if you

1030
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:11,199
give them eighteen thousand a year

1031
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,339
you're insulting them I'm not working

1032
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,559
for you for eighteen thousand a year

1033
00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:17,319
because there is a lack of respect I

1034
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,569
have a friend of mine who is a waitress

1035
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:22,839
that makes three thousand five hundred a

1036
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:25,869
month and these guys were always reading

1037
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:28,419
and updating their knowledge our

1038
00:56:25,869 --> 00:56:30,759
guessing offers at that level respect

1039
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:34,390
first of all and Rika said it's very

1040
00:56:30,759 --> 00:56:37,119
expensive to train talent to let them go

1041
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:39,969
away after the trained well perhaps

1042
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,799
because setting up the cyber reserve all

1043
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:44,469
of us here should push our government

1044
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:47,079
and not democracy you mentioned so that

1045
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:50,619
the government does its best to ensure

1046
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:52,630
that they pay reasonable salaries to

1047
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:54,699
those they employ and that would be step

1048
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:57,339
zero before you turn your story about

1049
00:56:54,699 --> 00:56:59,559
whether I should be a cyber reservist or

1050
00:56:57,339 --> 00:57:03,449
not treat me with respect I think that

1051
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:03,449
is a summary of what most people feel

1052
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:18,610
we have a question good evening my

1053
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:20,140
question relates to costs for companies

1054
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:23,050
and the availability of potential

1055
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:25,420
reservists for example I can go through

1056
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:28,060
the website I can check the alert level

1057
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:34,300
which is very high in terms of terrorism

1058
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:36,850
for example and I'm sure there's a

1059
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:39,850
strategy behind the scenes will you

1060
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:41,140
consider the cyber reservists that are

1061
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:43,390
already available

1062
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:46,350
how much availability are you thinking

1063
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:50,290
about because there is a clear cost here

1064
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:52,810
for companies and for people do they

1065
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:54,840
need to be available at any point in

1066
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,840
time

1067
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:04,220
because they have their lives have you

1068
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:06,580
thought about that in detail thank you

1069
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,580
so much

1070
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:21,699
please yes

1071
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,890
now we have a question over there

1072
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:26,369
another one I was there and then the

1073
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:26,368
third one

1074
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,200
thank you

1075
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:32,670
but first of all I would like to

1076
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:37,980
congratulate the panelists and the

1077
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:44,190
organizers I'll mention you my my two

1078
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:48,000
cents based on my own experience I met

1079
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:50,010
someone some time ago that works for one

1080
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,540
of these modern armies that has the

1081
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:56,220
cyber reserve he had a position in the

1082
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,990
army and he was working for a private

1083
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,950
company at the same time at the same

1084
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:03,720
time so two situations we talked about

1085
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:07,500
that will become my questions one which

1086
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:12,390
is purely operational this person would

1087
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:16,080
disappear for three weeks without

1088
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:21,299
explaining anything and projects would

1089
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:25,560
become impossible with him it's not just

1090
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:28,650
the money what what sort of rules must

1091
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:30,299
be defined for that game when people can

1092
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:33,840
be caused by government at any point in

1093
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:35,640
time and then in the depending on the

1094
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,830
nature of the company they may have

1095
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:41,220
access to data which may be very

1096
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:43,470
sensitive data which may be very

1097
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:47,700
attractive for intelligence services

1098
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:50,000
from other countries from other

1099
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,000
companies

1100
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:55,270
do you want to wait until the end of

1101
00:59:52,630 --> 01:00:01,770
those questions or right okay the next

1102
00:59:55,270 --> 01:00:01,770
one at the top

1103
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:07,770
just bear with us for a second

1104
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:15,879
hello my name is Jose Manuel

1105
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:24,460
my opinion this is not the best point in

1106
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:29,260
time to set up a cyber reserve so I have

1107
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:33,160
two questions this has nothing to do

1108
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:35,950
with cost savings why can't a state in

1109
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:38,230
Spain attract talent and then another

1110
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:40,720
question for the general why are we

1111
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:43,300
working on a cyber reserve before

1112
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:46,169
setting up a proper cyber defense unit

1113
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,170
within the army

1114
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:56,820
well some things are taking for granted

1115
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:59,370
anyway if you allow me I'll respond to

1116
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:07,410
the last question that is not true that

1117
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:09,930
is not true as always we are focusing on

1118
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:17,040
achieving certain levels in everything

1119
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:18,839
we do as we see as we see it we believe

1120
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:25,140
that having an additional resource the

1121
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:29,150
same reserve is a good idea what I

1122
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:36,060
wouldn't support I would never support

1123
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:38,550
is that that cyber reserve could act as

1124
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:40,980
a replacement for some of the resources

1125
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:44,090
we already have in place I think I made

1126
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,090
that point very clear

1127
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:55,730
so then examples for many of you so

1128
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,370
answering to two questions I am exactly

1129
01:01:55,730 --> 01:02:03,050
the same questions our colleague had ok

1130
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:05,240
same questions same questions exactly as

1131
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:09,800
far as I know okay don't take this for

1132
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:12,470
granted the fact that you belong to a

1133
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,540
cyber reserve in a certain country could

1134
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:16,700
prevent other countries from hiring you

1135
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:20,630
or certain companies from hiring you for

1136
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:27,350
example in the UK the British are very

1137
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:29,180
clear they want technical profiles there

1138
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:32,140
were technical profiles with knowledge

1139
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:37,819
on databases that sucessful days their

1140
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:39,680
eligibility criteria in the French model

1141
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:42,260
was the same thing they don't go so much

1142
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,919
into the technical things you have to be

1143
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:51,910
a French citizen free of a criminal

1144
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:54,200
record and then this issue of security

1145
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:57,379
accreditation which is a sensitive issue

1146
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,609
as you can imagine okay let me give you

1147
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:01,430
an example which is right is a

1148
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:03,530
relatively recent perhaps we are

1149
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:05,270
thinking we are assuming that the cyber

1150
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,730
reserve because it is part of the

1151
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:10,040
military approach as a reservist by the

1152
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:12,620
way I want to support my government and

1153
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:15,980
not just the army on the military I want

1154
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:17,500
to support government in general and I

1155
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:21,020
wonder if that is a suitable approach

1156
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:23,990
there is a national layout for the

1157
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:26,509
security of the country I think that it

1158
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:29,209
is a mistake that this is led by one of

1159
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:30,730
the stakeholders in that scheme because

1160
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:35,680
this has failed in other countries

1161
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:40,089
that is my opinion so as someone working

1162
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:42,669
for a private company let me tell you

1163
01:03:40,089 --> 01:03:46,299
what other countries are doing they have

1164
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:50,710
details for employees for employers well

1165
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:52,869
as a company I hire a guy who is going

1166
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:56,349
to be trained by the state with public

1167
01:03:52,869 --> 01:03:57,880
money and to be honest I'm not sure that

1168
01:03:56,349 --> 01:03:59,320
person will be trained in something

1169
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,599
relevant for what we do in our company

1170
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:04,210
and the second thing is the question

1171
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:07,710
posed by a colleague I know that they

1172
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:11,589
have 22 days of holidays every year

1173
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:14,520
class between 17 and 29 days of training

1174
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:17,799
every year just like the British have

1175
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:20,740
let me go back to the issue of wanna cry

1176
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:22,750
I mean straights our global sometimes

1177
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:25,450
they target the Ministry of Defence and

1178
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:29,230
sometimes to target the entire public

1179
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:30,750
system I remember those days in Lyon

1180
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:33,430
remember that

1181
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:35,820
Rahmon we didn't have enough people

1182
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:35,819
there

1183
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:39,310
and

1184
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:44,050
we need to have people to do all sorts

1185
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:49,840
of things and we didn't have in our

1186
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:51,130
hands suddenly eight of the people that

1187
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:55,150
were working with me

1188
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:56,770
Simon reservists were called remember

1189
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:59,650
the situation I do believe in cyber

1190
01:04:56,770 --> 01:05:02,590
reserve but have doubts in how to apply

1191
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:05,260
that concept practically this is not

1192
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:09,580
about being patriotic we're a very

1193
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:12,340
special country in other countries I've

1194
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:15,490
seen beautiful examples here I have

1195
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:17,740
danced I'd love to have ideas from any

1196
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:20,709
of you I have danced and I have to apply

1197
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:25,569
all of these concepts practically how

1198
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:28,210
thoughtful you're an expert do they have

1199
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:31,630
for the tears in China today in China

1200
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:35,440
have something beautiful which is called

1201
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:39,400
democracy and CNN you cannot even find

1202
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:40,240
that in any browsing engine in the

1203
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,820
search engine

1204
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:46,419
thank you so much first of all there's a

1205
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:50,430
question from me how do we retain that

1206
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:54,960
talent I've heard several people today

1207
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:54,960
saying that we learn talent escape

1208
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:02,049
it seems that talent is going away

1209
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:03,999
someone else said that money is not the

1210
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:05,829
most important driver it isn't the most

1211
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:13,479
important driver when you have a salary

1212
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:15,970
of a general let me give you an example

1213
01:06:13,479 --> 01:06:18,098
which goes along the lines of what Ramon

1214
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:20,288
said I love my country I love Spain I

1215
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:24,099
don't love their flag I don't feel that

1216
01:06:20,289 --> 01:06:26,349
flag but I love my country someone

1217
01:06:24,099 --> 01:06:29,349
working for the cryptology center with

1218
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:33,369
my were reports learning 28,000 or

1219
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:34,989
35,000 euros goes away is forced to go

1220
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:37,809
away because their salary is not good

1221
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:40,599
enough I don't understand that why do

1222
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:43,690
politicians in this country never pay

1223
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:45,970
attention to compensating talent

1224
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:49,289
reasonably why is that and not retained

1225
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:49,288
by paying them cut salaries

1226
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,980
since I am the visible face for this

1227
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:05,400
project and we more or less average

1228
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:08,880
answers to all of these or many of these

1229
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:10,130
questions let me let me attempt and so

1230
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,170
respond

1231
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:18,600
let me start talking about company how

1232
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:21,060
people are compensated one thing is the

1233
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:23,970
salary and another thing is the reward

1234
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:26,160
okay these are different concepts let's

1235
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:28,529
reward people let's reward companies

1236
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:31,290
we're not proposing to have a

1237
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:34,369
compensation package as such in place

1238
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:36,930
for companies or people and by the way

1239
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:43,340
you are absolutely right in everything

1240
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:43,339
you said I am a strong supporter

1241
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:52,230
of this idea and not just with

1242
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:55,049
government there in this country we are

1243
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:57,030
paying people peanuts and we are not

1244
01:07:55,050 --> 01:08:03,240
monkeys we have a lot of talented people

1245
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:05,730
on board and company policies must not

1246
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:09,930
focus exclusively on getting higher

1247
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:12,180
deals at the expense of salaries because

1248
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:13,950
I said that centers in the long run but

1249
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:15,620
let me go back to the main topic our

1250
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:20,460
proposal

1251
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:22,470
rewards to companies well we can take a

1252
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:26,489
look at alternative models that we see

1253
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:31,739
in neighboring countries in terms of

1254
01:08:26,488 --> 01:08:34,108
rewards reward programs if you

1255
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:36,839
contribute with cyber reservists to a

1256
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:38,549
certain project with government why

1257
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:40,080
shouldn't that be valued why shouldn't

1258
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:42,359
that be acknowledged because it is

1259
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:47,729
public administration that is training

1260
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:49,500
those cyber reservists son and him

1261
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:51,419
projects carried out for public

1262
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,689
administration you should take that into

1263
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,690
account

1264
01:08:56,750 --> 01:09:02,520
that would probably make companies

1265
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:04,790
understand the cyber reservists might be

1266
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:09,330
interesting people to get on board

1267
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:10,859
thereby retaining talent within for any

1268
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:14,340
projects that he could develop with the

1269
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:18,660
state let us think big not just the

1270
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:24,330
state Europe the state can't still has

1271
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:25,920
the power to compensate the state and

1272
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:28,109
this is the answer to a question from

1273
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,230
that side of the room I seem to remember

1274
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:34,620
of course the state have the ability to

1275
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:37,169
recruit talent this is public

1276
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:39,000
examinations anyone can go to public

1277
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:42,510
examine exams some become a civil

1278
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,630
servant I for example I'm a member of

1279
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:48,390
the information technology level in

1280
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:50,330
public office are we enough but for the

1281
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:54,120
time being it seems we are

1282
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:57,120
are we ready to compete in a global

1283
01:09:54,120 --> 01:10:00,570
market for talent no way they would even

1284
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:04,530
be legal we cannot pay the best talent

1285
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:07,969
in this room because there's no more

1286
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:10,620
limits the salaries that I can pay I

1287
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:14,960
cannot I cannot pay cellular salaries

1288
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:14,960
that are higher than mine so

1289
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:25,480
a potential approach here could be

1290
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:27,669
voluntary voluntary status awarded we

1291
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:33,968
have made a proposal for certification

1292
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:36,610
in this world if a certification issued

1293
01:10:33,969 --> 01:10:40,150
by the state saying that someone is an

1294
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:45,040
expert should be a good argument to get

1295
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:46,900
a good salary in a private company when

1296
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,420
you are submitting an application when

1297
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:51,190
you are participating in a public call

1298
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:53,469
to become a civil servant

1299
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:55,480
how about acknowledging that you are an

1300
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:58,030
expert what if you're earning a legal

1301
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:03,968
expert in public in international public

1302
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:05,889
law and you are specialized in IT when

1303
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:08,860
you judges and prosecutors we need lots

1304
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:09,460
of people everywhere so comentario

1305
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,589
rapido

1306
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:15,280
esto quiere decir que cieaura tengo tres

1307
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:18,190
mil euros my mum too nice le y me dijo a

1308
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:20,040
kaptara todo esto voluntarios okay we're

1309
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:27,610
talking about recruiting and retaining

1310
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:30,690
are you saying what you said that's your

1311
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:30,690
interpretation of what I said

1312
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,880
companies go out of their way to pay

1313
01:11:38,739 --> 01:11:41,879
really low salaries

1314
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:48,870
their opus is also very tricky very

1315
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,790
dodgy situations well there is an

1316
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:53,340
institution in this country where you

1317
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:56,880
have a group of inspectors if we had

1318
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:59,060
enough inspectors we could allow them to

1319
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:02,060
inspect what needs to be inspected

1320
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:02,060
please

1321
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:09,370
yes I wanted to focus on buyers

1322
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:14,050
questions addressed to you Xavier is

1323
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:18,360
there a way to find out that the

1324
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:18,360
recruiter is in the right side

1325
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:28,019
well we have personal security

1326
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:29,459
accreditations in place and also all the

1327
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:32,130
elements that have been included in a

1328
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:34,199
draft bill but anyway security

1329
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:36,540
accreditations are already there these

1330
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:42,540
security accreditations give you access

1331
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:44,790
to confidential information for security

1332
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:47,850
is it possible you know that but with

1333
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:50,400
accreditations we can ensure that we

1334
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:51,840
have people we can trust on board all

1335
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,530
countries have their own security

1336
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,530
accreditations

1337
01:12:57,519 --> 01:13:01,840
I've heard that question before if I

1338
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:07,210
miss I'm a reservist and I'm called by

1339
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:09,550
my company what happens I think if a

1340
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:11,829
crisis comes along we will see who would

1341
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:13,300
use whatever resources we have it's very

1342
01:13:11,829 --> 01:13:15,549
difficult than we can count on

1343
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:17,980
additional resources and I keep telling

1344
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:20,110
the room the audience the cyber reserve

1345
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:21,690
will be useful to capture or detect

1346
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:25,869
Talent

1347
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:29,369
on many occasions we tend to believe

1348
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:33,820
that we have more talent that we have

1349
01:13:29,369 --> 01:13:35,440
and my expectations salary-wise might be

1350
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,789
a hundred thousand and then the football

1351
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,219
club comes along and says thirty

1352
01:13:36,789 --> 01:13:44,559
thousand dollars more than enough having

1353
01:13:39,219 --> 01:13:48,610
said that we need to play by the rules

1354
01:13:44,559 --> 01:13:50,619
of the game if someone joins the cyber

1355
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:54,219
reserves the recital reserve gets

1356
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:57,460
training they should earn points if they

1357
01:13:54,219 --> 01:13:59,079
want to become a civil servant then I

1358
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:03,190
find a character with a correct approach

1359
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:05,710
but any cyber reservists should have a

1360
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:08,079
professional career plan they should be

1361
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:12,489
clear about that time that they're

1362
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:14,289
expected to work for the cyber during

1363
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:16,829
which they are expected to work for the

1364
01:14:14,289 --> 01:14:16,829
same reserve

1365
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,489
there's many things that came up

1366
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:31,060
this is about bashing software at

1367
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:34,480
telefónica because I wanna try this is

1368
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:38,590
not national security this is not about

1369
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:39,519
talent I was thinking about something

1370
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:45,100
much more serious

1371
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:47,740
point number two talent is leaving if

1372
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:52,060
they have to go abroad it means that

1373
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:55,440
this country doesn't need talent because

1374
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:55,440
they're not acknowledging talent

1375
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,520
ransomware

1376
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:05,110
there's always there it's not an

1377
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:08,770
exceptional situation who is who is

1378
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:12,130
training talent in that field I think

1379
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:14,050
you as hackers tend to say well I'm a

1380
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:18,370
hacker I'm stunning

1381
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:20,710
I'm also do you have surgeons born

1382
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:23,050
surgeons or do you trust them because

1383
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:25,540
they have operated on 500 patients who

1384
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:31,660
trains those surgeons that we need

1385
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:33,670
individual scenario when are they why

1386
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:36,700
don't we have permanent stable positions

1387
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:38,850
that training is not 15 days or 20 days

1388
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:41,860
every year this is about professional

1389
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:45,280
continues professional development what

1390
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:47,980
we can expect is to find that talent

1391
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,469
there where we have done nothing to

1392
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:52,809
foster the existence of talent I don't

1393
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:57,300
want to offend anyone but I think this

1394
01:15:52,810 --> 01:16:04,810
is useless this is an empty these goals

1395
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:07,710
okay another 1.44 what is that abyss

1396
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,710
hello

1397
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:18,020
the question is what I've shared many of

1398
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:21,980
the things that have been said here but

1399
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:28,580
the question is why instead of having a

1400
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:31,429
patriotic defense to save costs so Red

1401
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:34,580
Cross volunteers they actually saving

1402
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:38,290
costs is are they getting money from

1403
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:42,260
somewhere and we're talking about

1404
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:47,150
specific wanna cry crisis why the

1405
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:52,940
Estonians have cyber a voluntary cyber

1406
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:56,269
reserve I know that general Medina has

1407
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:58,150
reservists they're paid and we're

1408
01:16:56,270 --> 01:17:01,730
talking about a different thing

1409
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:04,509
why don't we identifies national defense

1410
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:07,400
with something else with another thing

1411
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:10,340
certainty synthesis problem or an issue

1412
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:13,040
of our culture of Defense

1413
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:15,590
perhaps in Spain we don't have our

1414
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:19,850
culture of defense and that's my

1415
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:24,340
question I'll leave it there well

1416
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:28,280
several points how about that

1417
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:31,160
undoubtedly a situation which is well

1418
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:34,849
known by every one of an ongoing threat

1419
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:37,490
makes everyone mobilize themselves in

1420
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:41,530
same direction that is the case of

1421
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:47,870
Estonia or Israel so we should not be

1422
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:51,080
this is rob ourselves here okay so not

1423
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:54,260
having a culture of national defense yes

1424
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:59,590
it is true the recent one but now the

1425
01:17:54,260 --> 01:18:01,930
point is let us start this cyber reserve

1426
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:05,150
if you think about the multiple

1427
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:07,670
difficulties that we will find we will

1428
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:09,950
even take a single de step let us go

1429
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:14,270
back to the exercise that we said before

1430
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:17,240
let us try let us try and use the most

1431
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:19,400
appropriate mechanism we will make

1432
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:22,820
mistakes we will control mistakes and

1433
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:31,480
let us fix that that can be fixed

1434
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:31,480
but let us not be petrified paralyzed

1435
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:38,690
due to the multiple difficulties that we

1436
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:41,450
will be facing because they have very

1437
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:44,480
many difficulties and we are nearly

1438
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:48,559
finishing okay so ten minutes away from

1439
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:52,549
finishing this run table and before you

1440
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:55,880
say you must was in the current state of

1441
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:59,270
the art how many of you would be happy

1442
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:03,560
to be volunteers can you please raise

1443
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:06,170
your hands is that 50% of the room well

1444
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:09,380
a bit less than fifty thirty or forty

1445
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:12,310
percent okay you'll raise your hands

1446
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,310
rise okay

1447
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:20,210
serpentine is a question okay

1448
01:19:26,189 --> 01:19:32,760
first of all congratulations you are

1449
01:19:29,489 --> 01:19:37,320
wonderful very brave for coming over

1450
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:39,479
here and to share your points so a very

1451
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:43,849
simple question imagine let us assume

1452
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:43,849
that I will have the talent to do that

1453
01:19:44,809 --> 01:19:51,329
so I don't mind the money that I will be

1454
01:19:48,989 --> 01:19:54,598
getting so because I'm hearing about

1455
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:56,728
real world certifications so that the

1456
01:19:54,599 --> 01:19:58,650
private companies pay you but public

1457
01:19:56,729 --> 01:20:03,510
companies cannot pay you how much can

1458
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:06,419
you pay can't you give me a bracket well

1459
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:10,650
and I will just leave this room okay

1460
01:20:06,419 --> 01:20:14,519
very happy to know how much you will be

1461
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:16,999
willing to pay because I pay the things

1462
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:21,300
that I buy with money but not with

1463
01:20:16,999 --> 01:20:23,059
homeland spirits I answer to you okay

1464
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:26,130
they said that they will pay nothing

1465
01:20:23,059 --> 01:20:29,869
because they cannot afford it okay if

1466
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:29,869
they pay nothing they will get nothing

1467
01:20:32,599 --> 01:20:36,469
we have the last question

1468
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:44,150
okay I'm going to recap something that

1469
01:20:41,869 --> 01:20:50,570
was said before it was said that there

1470
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:53,540
were only few women and that you could

1471
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:57,730
take advantage of the cyber brief prim

1472
01:20:53,540 --> 01:21:02,360
serve to give more visibility to women

1473
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:04,790
but if there is no real economic

1474
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:08,299
financial supports we are talking about

1475
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:13,099
a volunteering program what is the exact

1476
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:16,639
plan to engage women in that what is the

1477
01:21:13,099 --> 01:21:19,369
actual weight and importance that will

1478
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:21,469
be given to women who are interested in

1479
01:21:19,369 --> 01:21:24,320
these projects when I mentioned that has

1480
01:21:21,469 --> 01:21:28,179
a positive externality that could come

1481
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:32,449
out from any project that puts into

1482
01:21:28,179 --> 01:21:37,250
communication multiple talents okay and

1483
01:21:32,449 --> 01:21:39,219
without any gender segregation so we

1484
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:42,230
have more and more binary societies

1485
01:21:39,219 --> 01:21:45,440
Millennials against premillennial so our

1486
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:48,530
democracy is characterized by that we've

1487
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:51,079
seen that in practice we've seen like

1488
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:55,059
specific segments of populations that is

1489
01:21:51,079 --> 01:21:58,389
has the specific vote so therefore they

1490
01:21:55,060 --> 01:22:03,170
managed to prevail their common

1491
01:21:58,389 --> 01:22:06,500
cognitive bias over a small population

1492
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:09,170
group so I am one of the baby boomers as

1493
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:11,270
you can easily seen well I don't know

1494
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:13,969
how I will end up my days with no

1495
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:17,900
patient because you are not enough to

1496
01:22:13,969 --> 01:22:22,929
pay for my pension so well I hope to

1497
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:22,929
have a decent ending end of life

1498
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:28,870
Oh careful with what you say that

1499
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:32,120
doesn't sound very good

1500
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:34,430
well euthanasia is started to be

1501
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:36,050
regulated when this is what is waiting

1502
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:41,690
for us okay we are in a difficult

1503
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:43,820
situation okay having said that they are

1504
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:47,530
suffering young people are suffering

1505
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:50,259
from us getting hold to our job position

1506
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:52,700
okay for years and years because of

1507
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:55,610
retirement so we are undergoing a

1508
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:57,800
process of binarization for instance in

1509
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:58,630
gender ratio let us think about stem

1510
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,760
issue

1511
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:04,010
so not only stem issue I'm going to show

1512
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,950
you the counter example of that so that

1513
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:12,380
I understand it very likely we will have

1514
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:17,920
to make an inequality public policies to

1515
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:22,910
hire male judges and prosecutors because

1516
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:28,640
gradually women are embracing or working

1517
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:31,070
into the legal world and they have bias

1518
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:35,740
so to my viewpoints we will have to

1519
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:39,440
create multidisciplinary groups to

1520
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:42,860
attract the stem talent that has been a

1521
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:46,370
serie typed from our in our society

1522
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:48,710
where by women are rejected or feel

1523
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:53,990
rejected or do not feel sufficiently

1524
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:56,390
appealed by science and technology so if

1525
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:58,790
the and enough women developing

1526
01:23:56,390 --> 01:24:01,490
artificial intelligence the cognitive

1527
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:05,900
bias of the algorithms that are being

1528
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:09,980
developed as it was recently proved with

1529
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:13,969
Microsoft will make more men oriented

1530
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:17,690
more chauvinist society and algorithms

1531
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:20,540
will make many of the decisions in the

1532
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:23,719
years ahead of us so by putting in

1533
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:26,840
contact talents of different

1534
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:29,210
background so different origins result

1535
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:31,340
in the distribution of talents that is

1536
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:38,630
to say people learning from each other

1537
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:42,889
and it is very likely that if public

1538
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:45,979
policies establish - most likely one of

1539
01:24:42,889 --> 01:24:49,670
the effects from that or impact for that

1540
01:24:45,979 --> 01:24:51,979
will be eliminating the stem bias at

1541
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:57,559
least in this group and I wish that will

1542
01:24:51,979 --> 01:25:03,530
happen all right we move on to the last

1543
01:24:57,559 --> 01:25:07,429
round so very brief brief words from you

1544
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:12,170
okay let us start off with Ramon Ramon

1545
01:25:07,429 --> 01:25:15,820
do you are you willing to embrace this

1546
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:18,199
initiative yes I would be happy to be

1547
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:20,539
reservists I just don't want any

1548
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:24,219
politician to win a medal because of

1549
01:25:20,539 --> 01:25:27,050
that and I just don't want someone to

1550
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:28,099
politically capitalize that and to get

1551
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:31,729
money out of it

1552
01:25:28,099 --> 01:25:34,489
I defend my culture but I just don't

1553
01:25:31,729 --> 01:25:39,139
want anyone to make any brats to make

1554
01:25:34,489 --> 01:25:41,239
any profit out of me so me I would not

1555
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:43,249
be a cyber reservists I would be a

1556
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:45,228
volunteer I would do it for my community

1557
01:25:43,249 --> 01:25:48,800
I would did for those who need it but I

1558
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:53,360
would not play this game of disguising

1559
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:55,280
myself to pay for a consultancy so it

1560
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,739
doesn't really make sense that someone

1561
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:59,989
who has not invested any money on the

1562
01:25:57,739 --> 01:26:03,289
training expect something in return for

1563
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:07,070
free but any other thing if I were the

1564
01:26:03,289 --> 01:26:10,699
head of an NGO or any other charity

1565
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:14,329
well no not uniform no no no you don't

1566
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:17,539
pay well no no no uniform for me in that

1567
01:26:14,329 --> 01:26:20,030
case well yes okay I will be ready ready

1568
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:23,860
to sit down and to discuss it okay it

1569
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:26,139
will charity organization all right I

1570
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:30,400
insist

1571
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:30,400
only need to have volunteers

1572
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:39,400
it looks like if we were going to come

1573
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:42,880
to us and we were going to tap you on

1574
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:44,739
the shoulder so this is a task of years

1575
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,530
of months we have to get to know each

1576
01:26:44,739 --> 01:26:51,579
other we have to trust you but in the

1577
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:56,019
case of CNN when we called people we pay

1578
01:26:51,579 --> 01:27:00,659
and when we pay people are always happy

1579
01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:04,119
with those with that money

1580
01:27:00,659 --> 01:27:06,460
so my question my answer is one known by

1581
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:10,809
all of you here yes of course I would be

1582
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:14,800
a cyber reservists knowing that there

1583
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:18,599
are many problems to be resolved but it

1584
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:22,389
is a public policy that if well oriented

1585
01:27:18,599 --> 01:27:25,179
including highlight specific projects

1586
01:27:22,389 --> 01:27:29,980
with good resources could generate very

1587
01:27:25,179 --> 01:27:32,530
many externalities which are not for

1588
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:36,190
this at different from those of the

1589
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:38,409
cyber reserve system okay yes I will be

1590
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:40,960
a summary service but not at any cost

1591
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:43,829
and any expense would you like to add

1592
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:48,040
anything else well my specific case

1593
01:27:43,829 --> 01:27:50,769
understands that we have to support the

1594
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:54,040
estate okay not the ministries and I

1595
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:55,659
don't want this to be a tool and I know

1596
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:59,949
it is a true I work in the private

1597
01:27:55,659 --> 01:28:03,429
sector that would be double-edged sword

1598
01:27:59,949 --> 01:28:05,230
so I just don't want the private

1599
01:28:03,429 --> 01:28:07,480
companies ending up competing with the

1600
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:11,888
administration for talents okay and that

1601
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:16,059
could easily be the case okay so

1602
01:28:11,889 --> 01:28:19,960
positive I am an optimistic and person

1603
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:22,480
by nature to summarize it I think it is

1604
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:28,190
worthwhile to try it difficulties have

1605
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:31,370
very many of course and the last message

1606
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:33,110
Oh several references have been made to

1607
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:35,599
the Ministry of Defense the Ministry of

1608
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:41,089
Defense's at the service of Spain and of

1609
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:43,580
the Spaniards and not at all in favor of

1610
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:46,280
no one at the service of Spain and the

1611
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:48,860
Spaniards and that's our only purpose

1612
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:51,080
and I would like everything everyone to

1613
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:57,170
be very clear about that thank you very

1614
01:28:51,080 --> 01:29:02,150
much general so this is the end of our

1615
01:28:57,170 --> 01:29:05,770
from table so pick a greater applause

1616
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:05,769
please for them

1617
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:12,260
this is rooted something it's a pleasure

1618
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:16,090
it's being a pleasure being with you

1619
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:16,090
this is the end of the round table
