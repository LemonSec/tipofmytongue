1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,850
they'll rate Rizzo my know all rights

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:09,000
apologies for the delay working kena

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:13,290
would you please introduce yourself very

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,090
interesting presentation super chef well

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,520
we have to stand firm from the

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,769
instituted in present the other one from

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,230
PricewaterhouseCoopers and masters

8
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:30,060
course so Enterprise Waterhouse and

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:34,100
Cooper stand offering 20% discount to

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:38,610
the fruited participants I am a teacher

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,090
the instituto impreza master's course so

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,910
well

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,149
any of them two are really highly

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,510
recommendable so good morning everyone

15
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,579
thank you very much for being here

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:53,309
well I know that the two previous

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,920
speakers were very very interesting so

18
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,858
how many of you can speak more Sein

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,640
language as I said when we tried to

20
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,580
pronounce words fully and just blink

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,460
clearly so my presentation is about

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,679
witnesses in the transportation sector

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,039
I'm not talking about trains Oh

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,600
buses I'm talking about packages well

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,880
but I say I want your package that

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,000
sounds a bit weird in Spain so my name

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:28,949
is Frankie Molina I work for be engineer

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,259
and I work the old elements okay all

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,210
things that make me make lots of money

30
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:40,350
all the rooted speakers okay highly-paid

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,210
a web page and well if you have any idea

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,240
where I can make money just pull me or

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,689
contact me and it those contact details

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:53,189
all right so one of the things that

35
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:56,699
drove me to carry out this research has

36
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,548
been there for a long time so with this

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,200
I mean that I started researching on

38
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,289
this topic when I started to

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,299
9 and then I decided to bring this

40
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:10,288
presentation here to see whether I could

41
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,790
get a Ferrari car said payment so well

42
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:15,660
actually one of the things that caught

43
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:18,630
my attention is that government comes

44
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,900
every year with national strategy for

45
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,269
security and that is very interesting

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,630
because it also includes transportation

47
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:30,299
ok this is a logo that everyone

48
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:35,940
recognizes went to me this is an apple

49
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:42,299
logo but that is an iMac icon and this

50
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:44,599
is the icon of Big Bang Theory and we

51
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:51,000
have the problems with iPhone battery

52
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:54,420
the high price of his well and my report

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,170
my research includes all that and what

54
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,660
the tactics and the tools that I used

55
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,940
when I feel a bit like Homer Simpson's

56
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,209
and some just want to vindicate that

57
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,639
when we are talking about hacking it is

58
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,760
not only about the techniques the serum

59
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,549
ones but the lateral movements thinking

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,760
out of the box someone tells me to

61
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:21,180
follow this way I just decided to go off

62
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,989
track and to take a different pathway so

63
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,530
well if you are into security you will

64
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:31,850
follow my presentation very easily so

65
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:37,100
this is about reducing this perp sweets

66
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:40,440
to and what this is the example of this

67
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,720
car which is wonderful located car

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,130
already knows how to open the door ok

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,739
current situation I'm not talking about

70
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,010
the situation of the transportation

71
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,409
sector but I am just me

72
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,540
who has produced a research have wants

73
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:56,879
to pass it on or to share it with a

74
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,340
company so when you report a

75
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,879
vulnerability to company sometimes to

76
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,519
get a threat in answer results as an

77
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,899
answer and I said please do not do

78
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,510
anything to don't disclose that to

79
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,720
anyone because we may call our lawyers

80
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,120
we might call our lawyers sometimes when

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,940
you share a programming ability with a

82
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,949
company then they shall lack of interest

83
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,870
another type of lack of interest is

84
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,639
occupation or hiding so no one gives you

85
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:32,039
a chance to listen to what you have to

86
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:38,070
say and actually I ended up looking for

87
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:40,919
the whatsapp number of CTO imagine that

88
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:45,120
you are at home you're the CEO and then

89
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:48,780
you get a what's up by me telling you

90
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,180
about a vulnerability flow sometimes the

91
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,030
collaboration is free collaboration or

92
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,099
sometimes it is paid collaboration all

93
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,289
this has facilitated my report a lot

94
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:01,580
well meaning that there are some data

95
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:03,810
that I cannot really disclose to you

96
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,810
because it has someone who ends up in

97
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:14,130
jail all right so I will start off with

98
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:18,449
the transportation company it is company

99
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:22,710
the Jeep offers a GPS that allows to

100
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:25,500
track lorries and to have technical

101
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,560
information about this very so these

102
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,410
people had a failure that had been in

103
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,169
the catalogue for many years

104
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,229
so the reset token in the website and

105
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:42,030
website does not expire and it is this

106
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:44,699
session validation so instead of not

107
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,739
going through PHP if I am aware of the

108
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:51,300
token already

109
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:55,539
going so this is the easiest hacking

110
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,689
move in history and I went to Google and

111
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:01,120
I've seen that Google has cached the

112
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:04,330
token so this is a session

113
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,509
authentication of the company and what

114
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:12,849
happens well dad the company Louis

115
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:14,949
publicizes exists them and says oh yes

116
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:18,009
it's tracking system is spread all over

117
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:20,229
the Spain and what does the customers do

118
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,389
well in the corporate website and I say

119
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:25,030
ok you are going to send out a pal a on

120
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:30,340
with lemons to Germany I have reviewed

121
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:33,969
these tracking tracking for your friends

122
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,549
so they decided to offer this iframe to

123
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:39,159
enter your password but behind that will

124
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:43,690
have the same URL with the same token

125
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:46,930
failure so if you get to see the URL you

126
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:52,150
can already take over and that's the way

127
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:54,240
I access to the tracking system so and I

128
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:58,888
could really see what was happening with

129
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,889
30 companies

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,409
so this is what you get to see I can

131
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:11,510
access to the tracking of all the tracks

132
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:14,450
from very many companies so those tracks

133
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:17,210
that we see around on the roads and this

134
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:20,450
is not only not only allows you to

135
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:24,950
geolocate the track but it also the

136
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:28,490
track is associated to trade number and

137
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:31,190
you can also send in comments for

138
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:34,000
loading and unloading I could just send

139
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,710
a new structure away commands to the

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,070
truck driver and to tell him ok go to

141
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:42,640
Germany and load the car at the track

142
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:46,520
with I don't know these boxes of lemons

143
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,900
ok so this is a process failure this is

144
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:54,440
a process flow and one because they have

145
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:57,650
just included their iframe I got access

146
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,500
to that and then I went to this I found

147
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,289
these windows and as I say I could also

148
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,050
have information about the plate number

149
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,810
but doing a brute force of plate numbers

150
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:13,010
that's very highly costly but often well

151
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:16,970
these truck companies often renew their

152
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:19,310
fleet very often so trying out all these

153
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,490
combinations or different numbers to

154
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:25,580
find out the ID of the company was not

155
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,460
difficult well they have no quality of

156
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,340
service measures whatsoever number of

157
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:35,530
requests per seconds no anti Bruce

158
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:40,159
policy if you well after three or four

159
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:42,228
mistakes ok what they didn't do anything

160
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,420
okay to prevent that okay they didn't

161
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,480
put anything in place well order

162
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,510
tracking do you know where your order is

163
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,970
90 well when you buy online you get an

164
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,550
ID number and you see you can track to

165
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,680
Ulta so this is very simple

166
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,899
well most of the companies I took a look

167
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,660
at have this very same problem and so

168
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,560
what is affirming me tracking orders but

169
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:09,519
some companies showed in name others the

170
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,560
street number others also offer some

171
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:17,000
confidential information imagine that

172
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,869
I've researched three providers and then

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,459
to quantify the volume they - and Majan

174
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,680
that I am a competitor and say okay I

175
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,930
want to offer you this flat rate so this

176
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,969
is intelligence for the company that

177
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:34,760
should not be available again so one of

178
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:38,120
the things that I thought doing and say

179
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:41,300
okay logistic operators there are very

180
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,399
many out there and then I asked my wife

181
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,680
for permission and I say it kind of make

182
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,600
50 or 60 different orders on the

183
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,930
internet and I say yeah the first thing

184
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,139
you have to order is just a red flash

185
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:57,109
just to leave home and then say well let

186
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:59,779
us see what I can do okay I just looked

187
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,470
her up on Google and I could see where

188
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:05,300
most of the times users to congratulate

189
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,970
to show the satisfaction for the

190
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,269
transportation service they said oh this

191
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,290
is like very fast very fast service I'm

192
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,500
very happy with it

193
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:18,560
and then well I'll give you an example

194
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,130
but this is very rare but how many of

195
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,719
you were told that you were not at home

196
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,540
when they wanted to deliver the package

197
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,170
and then you were at home who is to

198
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,870
blame

199
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,269
well someone perhaps is to blame for

200
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:36,620
that they send out that message that

201
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:39,199
from information so if I go and study 30

202
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,819
of all logistic operators and then take

203
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:43,639
a look at the time line I made

204
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:45,769
different ID numbers so this was not

205
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,019
expected and then people posted this

206
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,629
comment okay your company sucks bitch is

207
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:53,269
knotted okay

208
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:57,499
order tracking okay the technique which

209
00:10:53,269 --> 00:11:02,539
is used to avoid or bypass first force

210
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:05,749
is well this is a question I think order

211
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:09,769
the other thing is mixing that with the

212
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:12,649
postal code and I'm very proud of the

213
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:15,339
way I just showed you sometimes they do

214
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:20,839
say well known hash this is an encrypted

215
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:24,379
method so you very easily can find the

216
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:29,209
application method that they use and

217
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:32,419
then okay letters to ID with these ports

218
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:35,539
and I always recommend the use and non

219
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:39,410
predictable encryption well if you want

220
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:41,419
to use the trick of postal codes okay

221
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,969
there are 10,000 characters but not all

222
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:46,579
of them come in these covers so the good

223
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,989
thing is that you go to the postal

224
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:53,929
websites and then to download the

225
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:57,049
postcode and what try to do this without

226
00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:00,108
not paying any money so the idea is to

227
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:03,549
use but and to use that identifier and

228
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:03,549
sell it to change it for you

229
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,289
so we see how the different logistics

230
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,149
operators give us information this is

231
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:14,329
from one appraiser this is run another

232
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:17,720
one this operator tells you that they

233
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:19,998
are a few minutes away and they tell me

234
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,669
about the street phone I even reported

235
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:29,139
or if I'm in mafia and I saw this news

236
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:29,139
frame and the guys coming along at 1:30

237
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,969
and yet she's coming to deliver a parcel

238
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:36,369
for the NEPA and you asked for your

239
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,319
parcel he might not be in their route at

240
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:41,259
that time but 99 percent of the time

241
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:45,009
they will give you the parcel and here

242
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:47,889
you go funny things closed premises I

243
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:50,170
mean if you go out eight o'clock they

244
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:56,160
probably close at 7:30 well the guy in

245
00:12:50,170 --> 00:13:00,279
charge of delivering 8 p.m. target

246
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,499
destination Barcelona here we have one

247
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:08,799
which is more international here we have

248
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:10,779
an order from Miami and again using

249
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:14,399
brute force you this is what comes out

250
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:16,839
and with this I cannot win my Ferrari

251
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,439
okay I need to tell you about other

252
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:24,309
things as well what if I send my orders

253
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:27,329
home perhaps

254
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:27,329
Ramon would allow this

255
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,580
anyone knows his company

256
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,480
this is a world one known company

257
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:42,770
because it's one of the safest in Spain

258
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:47,420
afternoon choreo so they allow me to

259
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:48,860
choose all of these things curious what

260
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,479
I say that this is one of the most

261
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:57,230
important ones one of the safest in

262
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:59,690
Spain they use this to hide their IP

263
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:04,990
address but not for their daughter yes

264
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:10,670
address so we see what the IP address is

265
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:13,130
really cool don't open a limit on a

266
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,890
level so present report a of recyclable

267
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:19,820
so they offer you the feels for the

268
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,290
postcode for the number of shipments if

269
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:26,330
you have something that you found in

270
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:28,540
twitter by using brute force I can get

271
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,540
it

272
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,470
this is not something I bought myself

273
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:39,270
that the destination is Bernard ASA

274
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:41,910
Martina in Madrid violin Estella farias

275
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,520
violin I can't imagine myself buying

276
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:51,480
such a thing but anyway this is how the

277
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:53,280
process goes on people ask me did you

278
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:58,640
actually process our order I didn't do

279
00:14:53,280 --> 00:15:02,280
it because I think this is illegal here

280
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,760
this very transport system transports

281
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,760
company

282
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,130
does something similar they look and

283
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:17,479
feels very similar the Web Services

284
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:17,480
behind the scenes are basically the same

285
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,470
they have providers that don't have

286
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,470
integration with other systems but I've

287
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,480
seen this type of flaw in all sorts of

288
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:31,649
websites they don't they don't usually

289
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,769
pay attention to this here even beauty

290
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:37,620
products you change the address and they

291
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:41,940
send it home here this is the one for

292
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:45,660
the easterly various valid pramana how

293
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:49,380
are we doing ferrari wise okay another

294
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:54,060
one another one you asked you place an

295
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:56,000
order origin and destination in madeira

296
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,109
these are not orders placed by me

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,920
postcode Wow

298
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,480
secret and they allow me to get in

299
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,389
pinging it picking it up into your face

300
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,320
or changing into your dress and this is

301
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:13,519
quite funny when you start working with

302
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,519
this with the water bird

303
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:21,560
it asks for the postcode on the order

304
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:25,970
number when you go straight into it

305
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:28,969
this is what happens the URL that is

306
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,640
going to give me the tracking details

307
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,110
doesn't shake the postcode through here

308
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,400
you check the postcard through here you

309
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,410
don't so this is the route in pay Note

310
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,010
one this is the variable in payload -

311
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:45,829
this is the variable I change all the

312
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,560
ones that have more than 32 they're

313
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:51,910
starting by thirty mean that the word

314
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,910
the page has more contents

315
00:16:54,510 --> 00:17:03,830
time-wise am i doing fine this is why I

316
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,829
left with another one

317
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,629
I've told you about several I can send

318
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:15,270
parcels home for free from several

319
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:17,340
providers ticket take a look at this one

320
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,280
the luca feel is different we're the

321
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:24,030
same company behind the scenes you can

322
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,430
access an international system based on

323
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,379
whether you are in the EU or not the

324
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:34,200
intelligence is the same non-existent

325
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:40,590
here they should use something that I

326
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:42,780
cannot interpret this is a code if I

327
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:47,250
move around the letters and the figures

328
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:49,110
I will not get to the data so I found

329
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:55,020
this page do you know it how many know

330
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:57,379
this page this is a website which is

331
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,940
quite popular when doing auditing

332
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,680
security auditing to find out about

333
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,690
security measures in place in different

334
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,180
providers perhaps you've heard about

335
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:10,920
another one on SSL SSL tests it tells

336
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,320
you about the quality of the certificate

337
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:18,030
it gives you a ranking when you do those

338
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:21,419
check ups it gives you the option to say

339
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:28,710
yes or no to doing to publishing the

340
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:31,350
audit results here we have a URL and it

341
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,060
was sent here these games it gives any

342
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,340
information about the security headers

343
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,770
and other things what is really striking

344
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:42,570
is that the URL address they used for

345
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:44,610
checkups is what you see here I'm

346
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,560
entering information of this type I

347
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,719
cannot implement a need for any brute

348
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,379
force here because I don't know what the

349
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,380
algorithm is

350
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,450
but for these two characters and these

351
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:02,230
six characters are there I can change

352
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:06,400
nine two three four five six because

353
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,679
this becomes this with that payload for

354
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,179
the last six fields those are hot more

355
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:16,450
than nine hundred could be sent to me in

356
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:20,080
this case they used protection for the

357
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:23,950
identifier but they didn't block any

358
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:28,030
attempts using brute force so I can have

359
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,660
things that live it I'm not sure you can

360
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:33,970
read this

361
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:36,490
no before this type of dates I was not

362
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:41,590
allowed now it is these are not orders

363
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:43,179
placed by myself anyway more shipment

364
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:49,949
options if you give me your email

365
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:52,330
address what's next you clean my house I

366
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,920
don't know what value you can add if I

367
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,678
give you the email address but there's a

368
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,130
whole world behind the scenes you can

369
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,640
buy something and have it installed here

370
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:06,580
I can change details for a customer in

371
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,250
the US I guess this is another one that

372
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,760
is one that wants delivery at a

373
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,760
neighbor's

374
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:20,580
things you can laugh at okay so let's

375
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,080
see the last case this is one of the

376
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,960
companies that threatened me very

377
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,370
seriously

378
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,790
and that's why I say that these are

379
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:32,760
solutions to laugh at this company had

380
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:36,060
done tracking really well everything I

381
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,700
examined was fine I could get the order

382
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,440
history but I couldn't interact with the

383
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,910
system I couldn't change the address I

384
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,610
couldn't have the order to leave it at

385
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,560
home but after so many years when you

386
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,050
take a look at the input boxes and the

387
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:53,070
elements you know that you can hack that

388
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:55,590
I was bored I was more or less depressed

389
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,810
and I said 1 2 3 how about this and then

390
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,220
the system says oh yes zero zero one two

391
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:04,350
three there we go

392
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:08,100
a good carb there back up the angel and

393
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:10,169
a devil so I wondered could it be that

394
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:15,389
when they deliver services to the

395
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:19,230
franchises they do this they use this

396
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:20,730
user number and password is the same the

397
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,390
first time you get in change your

398
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,210
password

399
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:27,800
does that sound feasible as a business

400
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,870
process not as a technology well indeed

401
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:35,730
if the username and the password are the

402
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:37,590
same we get there so I got there it is

403
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,850
not that I could have parcels delivered

404
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:43,770
at home I was within the system itself I

405
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:46,469
could do anything launch queries do

406
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:48,600
anything I wanted I'm not sure why that

407
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,460
was great out perhaps there was some

408
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,060
sort of restriction in place when I was

409
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,440
within the system itself this doesn't

410
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,919
relate to tracking itself but the

411
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,280
security in the company really what is

412
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,140
the way to solve this well some people

413
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,910
have your password there's someone in

414
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,040
worthiness at least in Spain who has who

415
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:11,340
knows your password how about changing

416
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:15,450
it but the problem is I know your

417
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,669
password so your security full-floor has

418
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,170
to do with me doing things I can change

419
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:24,060
the password and I can

420
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,060
through your customer basically

421
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:35,200
for this solution does is jeopardizing

422
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,080
the situation at the franchise quick

423
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,290
conclusions there's very little security

424
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,270
in critical infrastructures they focus

425
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,480
especially on user experience rather

426
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,310
than security it is relatively easy to

427
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,080
place orders to be delivered at home

428
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,730
through five different companies and

429
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,909
that affects national and international

430
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,830
companies provided I'm not sent to jail

431
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,650
in my next presentation I'll tell you

432
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:02,040
the same about food delivery thank you

433
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,040
so much

434
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:18,809
it won't ask any questions I don't see

435
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,809
any hands there's one over there right

436
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,540
good afternoon first of all thank you so

437
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,670
much spectacular how long did it take

438
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,920
you that's my first question second

439
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:40,560
question do you expect these companies

440
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,560
will use solutions in the near future

441
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:49,060
by testing this the time you've seen he

442
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,060
was

443
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:57,530
just imagine that you get the option to

444
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,990
do things without using your user ID and

445
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:04,220
your password so I decided to do this

446
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:07,190
with all the major companies it's the

447
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:10,490
water bird using the user ID for a few

448
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,929
times minutes really many of these

449
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,170
companies have already solved those

450
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,520
issues and I hope that all of them do

451
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:18,620
this is not because of me this is

452
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,600
because of all of us I would like the

453
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,600
logistics industry to work properly when

454
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,360
they say I was not at home and I was

455
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,909
there I always get angry then I thought

456
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,479
that this is useful and they do things

457
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,610
another question

458
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,299
somewhere else over there towards the

459
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,299
center of the room

460
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:46,750
good afternoon very interesting

461
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,060
there's something I wanted to mention

462
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:55,260
about something that happened to me a

463
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:58,179
month ago I bought hardware components I

464
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:02,610
place an order don't name any names

465
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:06,240
please where everything was smooth I

466
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:09,669
forgot about it and after a month I

467
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,920
placed another order and to my surprise

468
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:15,580
I realized that in the last step before

469
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,160
actually doing the checkout I saw an

470
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:21,399
address for a Russian guy I've never

471
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:25,150
heard of and that wasn't a shop so as

472
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:28,720
you said it's relatively easy to modify

473
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,520
do you address details in the shop not

474
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,210
in the platform does that sound logical

475
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:37,270
well first of all thank you so much for

476
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:40,230
speaking with me Murphy an accent ethnic

477
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,450
component is it's a really good company

478
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:47,770
because there are pasted boards yeah

479
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:50,680
that's not illegal they have a large

480
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:53,110
volume of sales they target people like

481
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,620
you that all of you are nice people but

482
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,909
you like moving around those systems

483
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,909
they've had many security breaches

484
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,860
recently do you mean last year anything

485
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:06,160
you tell me about petha component is I

486
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:10,000
believe it I never buy it from them by

487
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,150
the way enough enough in terms of irony

488
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,710
that's it a very quick question from me

489
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,710
and we'll now move on to another one

490
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,310
can you buy hazardous or dangerous

491
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,960
materials for these companies if I

492
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:31,639
bought something like enriched uranium

493
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,770
and I wanted that order to be processed

494
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,260
by the transport company and then

495
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:47,600
someone hacks the target destination

496
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:48,980
yeah yeah drugs over over to uh uh I was

497
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,649
thinking about Harrison but you got your

498
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:57,730
way I see most companies have to do with

499
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,730
frozen perishable goods

500
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,370
perhaps you're worried about enriched

501
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:08,530
uranium or perhaps someone else is

502
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:11,060
worried about an erotic toy of some sort

503
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:14,830
but anyway the ability to access the

504
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,830
information within the system is there

505
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,300
everything I know I learned from him I

506
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,790
have to say that very good presentation

507
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:29,120
I think we have to talk again sometime

508
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:36,190
before Christmas I need to play some

509
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:36,189
orders PCA bruticon let me ask you

510
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,830
instead of sending an email message to

511
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:49,149
the company and telling them about the

512
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:51,740
problems have you ever considered

513
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,930
contacting the national institutions

514
00:27:51,740 --> 00:28:00,500
regarding it in charge of cybersecurity

515
00:27:53,930 --> 00:28:02,920
that's a good question yes and no if I'm

516
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,920
inspired

517
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,660
I tried to find people I start again in

518
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,980
touch with institutions but free audits

519
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,310
no this is not something I'm interested

520
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,310
in

521
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:26,410
for things like these for contacting the

522
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,270
Civil Guard or the National Center for

523
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,610
crypt for cybersecurity

524
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,500
I don't usually contact them but

525
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,939
processing plant my floors I don't I

526
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,200
don't usually get in touch with anyone

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:40,110

528
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,890
