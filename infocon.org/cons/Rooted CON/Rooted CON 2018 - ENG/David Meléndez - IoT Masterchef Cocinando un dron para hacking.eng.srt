00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,250
coming this is full of people I love it

3
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,160
please put your phones in silence

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:33,410
there are people with the phones on

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,410
really how unrespectful this respect

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,350
welcome to this talk the title is i/o

7
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:50,699
tea master chef cooking it run for

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:52,890
hockey my name is daya bilenda I am you

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,329
have my Twitter account there to make me

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,350
feel more important to feed my ego and

11
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:05,809
let me know that I have lots of

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,809
followers so that's me

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:19,480
this is chairman we still that's a name

14
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:21,790
and as I've said in the drone I propose

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,260
in the Robert Texas Ranger because

16
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,780
everything's great if it's called that

17
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,960
way and I am also the author of the book

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,460
hacking with runners in if you have you

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,890
brought it with you I am at the

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:41,380
delighted to sign them so I've been in

21
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:45,010
this event and a few more making look

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:50,910
important slide let's put something

23
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:55,030
strong if I say Isis and drones people

24
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:58,000
start going crazy really you have to

25
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:01,540
start strong the current event then you

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,660
concerned of the Pentagon the drones of

27
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:10,209
the Isis say and we see two guys these

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,150
are the drones not the ones that are

29
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:19,780
published in Huckabay but we see it

30
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:21,670
around here with tape full of and if you

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,019
were aiming for something to do

32
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,329
something bad it would be useful

33
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:27,330
actually another news item that I like

34
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:41,430
this was shot down great job you can say

35
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,470
that you go home and feel any of earn

36
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,860
your salary is that requiring a further

37
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,859
explanation

38
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,809
the Defense Ministry this came up

39
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,470
yesterday and the panel discussion a

40
00:02:51,810 --> 00:03:05,580
large of the threats of drones in the

41
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:18,890
hands of foreign enemies and I'm ABC

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:18,890
drones a great threat made America wrong

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,390
look cute

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:31,019
the drone could have a midnight but

45
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:33,290
that's native kid I want to provide

46
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:37,769
context for this talk

47
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:41,070
the drones threat they are actually

48
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:45,959
flying computers IOT Internet of Things

49
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:49,500
on your above your head that's what we

50
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,239
used to call it but we're actually

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,209
talking about the small computers and

52
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,930
better system that's all specific

53
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:01,769
payment of hard our charges you can you

54
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,250
can put make it transport anything they

55
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,989
say a neutron has come up from the

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,680
research and development department of

57
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:15,240
the company superstar that it carries

58
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,000
something in the storage part

59
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,220
do I do perception development if I put

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,660
something in the back of my car mm

61
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:29,540
nobody had put in before I'm doing yeah

62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:34,290
so this sector the industry goes crazy

63
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:37,940
droned how could we detect them chase

64
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:42,720
them control them and throw them away

65
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:46,460
humiliate them and dump them out and one

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,650
of the ways is detecting them through

67
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:54,180
cameras or thermal cameras or infrared

68
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:58,609
and that can give you a physical shape

69
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:03,870
of the machine based on the heat

70
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:06,720
produced by the engines the engines the

71
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:12,780
shape that they have inside of the

72
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:15,260
camera well for hot points in the shape

73
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,359
of a square that's probably not a bird

74
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:22,710
people also say well depending on how it

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:27,290
rings it could be one or the other the

76
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:31,469
audio of footprint but above all and

77
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,780
first of all the signals that it

78
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:40,410
compares to the pilot of the drone and

79
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:42,750
it they they control in telemetry ok

80
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,680
this drone of this brand has a certain

81
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,750
signature

82
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,790
the conveyors you can notice that behave

83
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:58,240
in a very specific way and there are

84
00:05:48,790 --> 00:06:00,820
happy needin studies that focus on on an

85
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,889
external stimulus first as if I believe

86
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,320
that I'm being spied on with drones at

87
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:09,360
home or at the movies I switch on and

88
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:15,010
off the light of my home so that the

89
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:17,289
bright changes in the drone image that's

90
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,889
very weird but there's actually an

91
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:23,260
article published about this but above

92
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:28,530
all it's about the signature of the

93
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,530
radio signal in each one of the machines

94
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:39,099
this one I have a particularly funny hey

95
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:42,880
do not worry with my app I've designed a

96
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,770
knot and you can install that and if you

97
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,430
see a drunk you do that

98
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,500
and the app tells you which is the wrong

99
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:56,260
one summation X right because this is

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:58,690
becoming trendy here and it seems to be

101
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,190
heading for drones to be flying around

102
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,789
the city some of this application you'll

103
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,950
be able to check with each drone in in

104
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:08,169
real time whether it is legally legal

105
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,620
and what submission to force everybody

106
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,419
to install that this little program in

107
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,880
their own drone so that they voluntarily

108
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:18,479
provide this information about their

109
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,479
intentions

110
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:27,429
I mean that one was smart really smart

111
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,990
your own conclusions

112
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:45,979
so what actions what we have already

113
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:50,860
detected at wrong and we can we have it

114
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,860
sort of a payment screen and this we're

115
00:07:51,580 --> 00:08:00,198
do you issue a greater power it's about

116
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:03,519
I'm stronger than you you that's all so

117
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:11,029
I speak louder than you and therefore

118
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:14,689
your drone cannot listen to you it's the

119
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:16,300
EMP the electromagnetic pulse and I

120
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:21,860
found out what that was playing

121
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:24,949
Starcraft and a while ago certainly and

122
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:30,610
it's about nineteen electromagnetic

123
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:34,399
pulse that sort of melts the electronic

124
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:40,009
but the more standard procedure is radio

125
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:44,029
Yemen and is appealing because they talk

126
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:49,519
about the gold fever and I have Joey and

127
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:51,860
I'm here with my wife I'm Jack her this

128
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,139
came up in the DEF CON this type of

129
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,139
device in our Sears

130
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,609
which is drones gone mad we go crazy

131
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:11,010
with their Santa drone system they can

132
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:15,110
go to 3,000 your are still 10,000 and

133
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,110
you need a guy to be holding that rifle

134
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:29,010
but this is really my favorite this is

135
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:30,720
from I think a British brand well it's

136
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,970
part of the same team the whole thing

137
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,970
and it's about Raider

138
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:42,960
thermography cameras yeah mirrors

139
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:47,239
protocol of hacks so the whole catalogue

140
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,240
for just 1 million yours

141
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:55,410
and you say to yourself it's gonna be

142
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:58,230
very bad if with a million euros you

143
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,600
cannot insert yeah stop today drones the

144
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,710
question is how many drones gonna buy my

145
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:09,570
stuff with a million euros so depending

146
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:11,760
on the model for port in thousand and

147
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:16,050
five hundred drones no can that this

148
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,000
machine it those 14,000 drone maybe

149
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,969
that's not how you should compute these

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,890
figures you just should throw in money

151
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:28,740
and that's it and because what the only

152
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:31,540
thing that matters is stopping them at

153
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,430
other options I love

154
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:38,020
and the issue is whether these drawn is

155
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:41,150
the appropriate size what if it's not

156
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:46,270
whether you get it from how do you hold

157
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,270
it and then matron is bigger than yours

158
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,660
we were saying my radio is bigger than

159
00:10:52,040 --> 00:11:05,000
yours and now my tron is because any

160
00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:07,069
yours it's all about size really only be

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,090
called counter countermeasures but these

162
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:14,330
are just palliative measures if

163
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:17,840
frequency starts being I'm not going to

164
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,280
talk a lot about my this life because my

165
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,840
bosses are here and they are there

166
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,100
people in telecommunications and they

167
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:34,060
might beat me up afterwards but the idea

168
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:40,100
is to use white and spectrum that is to

169
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:42,050
use a very wide range of wavelengths so

170
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,250
that if one fails you have a very ample

171
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,170
base the next one is obviously do you

172
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,590
use the frequency that the Yammer is not

173
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,410
prepared for this is like the cat and

174
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,690
the mice so if you have this if this is

175
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,990
your frequency range your summer

176
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:04,820
something else and your Yammer is no

177
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:09,080
good and then robust protocols I

178
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:14,270
remember I don't know if they are around

179
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:16,250
here if you're here one who did an

180
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,710
attack on an authentication attack

181
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,830
through the drone Wi-Fi and I thought

182
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:24,190
I'd do my own Wi-Fi protocol with

183
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,190
casinos

184
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:38,399
and casinos think that that kind of last

185
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:44,279
year and I'll show you what it is about

186
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:50,250
later on that's that with all this and

187
00:12:44,279 --> 00:13:00,570
all this but let's do air drone that

188
00:12:50,250 --> 00:13:01,860
goes through a 3G and 4G okay they

189
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,579
cannot do you having to me because it's

190
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,790
illegal I don't know what could go wrong

191
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,790
with that

192
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:19,560
yeah MERS do not die him

193
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:20,940
this was the site that I picked up from

194
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,680
the dead come and they were saying

195
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:35,089
that's what they were saying it is

196
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:35,089
illegal for G

197
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:46,610
so I know you jammy was having me draw

198
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:52,490
number one so to to get more specific

199
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:57,760
and more technical you know that con

200
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,760
2013 in fact it was my first talk I

201
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:08,360
presented the at report on which is it's

202
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:10,240
a drone it's still there I didn't kill

203
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:16,930
it off yet

204
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:21,440
it's a dropper strong Wi-Fi router

205
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:27,260
there's a Verity control he's through a

206
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:30,590
C program I'm sorry that runs on the

207
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:33,410
router and it reads the data of the same

208
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:37,280
source that were just the commands of

209
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:39,740
the we because at that time you couldn't

210
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,980
buy sensors that easily or they were

211
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,980
incredibly expensive so I was better to

212
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,860
use the command staff they if you want

213
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:53,420
to see just have to go to the web of

214
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:56,960
wrote that whose control through html5

215
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:59,660
and it was a radio Wi-Fi and I did a POC

216
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,720
on beacons that I will explain more

217
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,719
about

218
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,620
and what next

219
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:21,239
in the face of this I said to myself

220
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:25,980
well I have to do something and then I

221
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:28,559
remember this city in Star Wars when in

222
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,259
Star Wars were not about a reason to cry

223
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:36,238
and they commanded it I thought that

224
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:45,209
they are 30-30 shapes but they're so

225
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:48,209
small that they are laser I've named

226
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:51,660
this interceptor in just a few hours ago

227
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:56,689
I'm gonna call it our interceptor

228
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,689
depending on which vision which region I

229
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:11,459
made with Chinese rocks because they say

230
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:13,739
the cover of the Tron is are so cheap

231
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:16,829
you get one in nature in the Chinese

232
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:19,879
story that's yes but then nobody will

233
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:27,410
believe that I've done it but with this

234
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:27,410
Chinese and this is a book or plague

235
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:35,899
plague that exists it has four engines

236
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:53,230
no tri-phasic engines just standard and

237
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:59,939
and not super efficient now what's the

238
00:16:53,230 --> 00:17:03,850
late motive of this project obviously

239
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:12,270
it's harder to detect without this a

240
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:12,270
thermographic cameras minimum weight

241
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:30,280
that means I can do more I can launch

242
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:36,309
the whole squadron against you depth of

243
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:37,200
hardware everything I wanted it to have

244
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:41,039
everything

245
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,039
you should also hack

246
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:53,909
this is what I come here to complain and

247
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:55,440
to tell you about my sorrowful story how

248
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,790
this project went because that's why

249
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:13,470
we're cooking it wrong the first thing

250
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:25,560
was to choose sensor data our sensors

251
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:37,290
not the type react so I expressed that's

252
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:41,730
always a possibility the first one that

253
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:45,600
struck me was MPU 9250 karasov

254
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:47,900
accelerometer magnetometer barometer so

255
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,899
great

256
00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:06,280
and then ask for the smallest board with

257
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:06,280
until five minutes ago it was correct

258
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:13,490
but until just recently there's this

259
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:18,639
board which is just a bit bigger than a

260
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,640
euro coin and it has Wi-Fi in Linux and

261
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:30,050
has inspired himself in in the Wi-Fi

262
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:34,880
router the black is the system that has

263
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:42,070
Wi-Fi Linux and the system of course the

264
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:42,070
CPU and you have the memory in the flash

265
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:43,940
it's a signal a digital signal that is

266
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:47,240
sent in intervals up down up down it's

267
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:55,070
just a square signal and the longer it

268
00:20:47,240 --> 00:21:00,460
stays up more wealthy engine turn so I

269
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:03,110
went the pain is up I can change that to

270
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:07,760
the time that the pain stays up to

271
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:11,939
change the speed

272
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,820
but then the party starts at the quarry

273
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,790
comes in and the first thing I see is

274
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:25,260
that the guy who has designed it another

275
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:32,280
Chinese guy so is that the link driver

276
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:34,500
because it is their own it is private it

277
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,889
doesn't meet the standard that I have a

278
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:41,240
perfect SDK to develop my stuff and I

279
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:48,540
say okay well pay me if you want me to

280
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:53,420
up in your great SDK an image of open

281
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:57,120
wrt but it's not in the official branch

282
00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:02,100
you have to download it from somewhere

283
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:05,580
else there is a little program there to

284
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,830
change the pins and then there is a

285
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,250
device tree that I will explain in more

286
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,250
detail

287
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:20,510
so I couldn't believe that because it

288
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:25,629
was really still half coke that's still

289
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:29,800
more strange software I take a look at

290
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:34,670
the drivers of their centers because the

291
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:41,600
MBU 2.5 and the other ones this is cheap

292
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:45,680
maybe your mom has it just completely

293
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,159
standard but you go there and then first

294
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:52,070
of all for makers will have Intel that

295
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,280
says no problem I have a library that

296
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,679
I've done it on my own from scratch to

297
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,770
make your life easier

298
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,510
what's your library like then do you

299
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:07,780
have an ID son no do you have a

300
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:11,120
raspberry you know well get lost

301
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,670
well if you go to the source code and

302
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,860
you are this in that version from that

303
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:18,350
ivory I don't know how that is now but

304
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:22,010
in the version of the library you have

305
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:24,260
to touch the source code and to say I'm

306
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,140
a friend I'm just going to I'm just

307
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:33,980
going to use that but they say doesn't

308
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:38,990
say Edison here and also it came with

309
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:40,700
Brighton's Python but you have to

310
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,280
deactivate all of that because you don't

311
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,919
want to to have sixteen Megazine

312
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:52,760
something like that is actually normal

313
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:54,590
rotors have four and then because we

314
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,230
need this to be quite sort of in

315
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,990
real-time in an operating system which

316
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:07,190
is has not been designed for real-time I

317
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:09,500
do must get my own scheduling and I say

318
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,350
well I'm gonna forget about the library

319
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,720
because I don't have a driver do not

320
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:18,620
tell me that it doesn't have a driver

321
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:26,540
I'm going to do it properly like a pro

322
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:28,100
so I go to a hundred and yes drivers but

323
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,139
they've also done sort of on their own

324
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:35,379
as they saw fit and the cabinet was

325
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,510
monotone and the candle of course are I

326
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:42,890
don't know this is three year old so

327
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:46,070
easy let's not overdo it the

328
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:50,809
functionalities he turns out that their

329
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:53,270
garland is the most current one the most

330
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:54,918
current one didn't even have support for

331
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,360
that chip specifically so you have to

332
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:02,090
say no it's something it's another one

333
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:07,059
so you can see here in the well tree

334
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,059
when you're going to compile it open

335
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:19,369
when you do cattlemen coffee you get the

336
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,830
kernel controllers everything at the

337
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:28,879
normal current should have you activate

338
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:31,519
a driver of the controller of the i2c of

339
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:34,248
the specific hardware for your board for

340
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:40,399
your tip set and then you say there is

341
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:42,950
an inventions here and be using five but

342
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:44,988
it's not the same okay but that's be

343
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:50,889
nice to each other if you are a few

344
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:53,629
defiant then you can you can work

345
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:57,080
together so all happens afterwards you

346
00:25:53,629 --> 00:26:01,149
you need to modify the device tree which

347
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,149
is a hardware description file

348
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:17,460
for example if you're looking for mobile

349
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,980
device trees every mobile house its

350
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:24,750
device tree so this one has this or that

351
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:27,810
sensor in that description it tells you

352
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:33,150
as you might see here within the i2c

353
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:39,510
section you have a sensor and we think I

354
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:42,810
to see you have address 6969 has

355
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:45,540
accessible use tablet that is compatible

356
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:48,419
with in that sense NP you now you need

357
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:53,190
to fight danger option pain code so

358
00:26:48,420 --> 00:27:00,140
unlike okay look at the board so there's

359
00:26:53,190 --> 00:27:05,450
nothing saying interruption here okay

360
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:07,850
I look at chip datafeed and they didn't

361
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,520
put it through a ping you need to weld

362
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,120
it on the actual leg of the sensor not

363
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,120
on the board

364
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:20,710
so despite that obstacle say ok no knows

365
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,790
how these in dropshipping so the driver

366
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,790
knows where you are

367
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:28,629
well you aren't oh no you have a

368
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:31,360
prepared reading you lift that thing and

369
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:33,310
you read it and you drive with us or not

370
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,560
so you need to recite all those things

371
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:43,210
in this file the other things like alkyl

372
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:45,190
like are with the orientation matrix if

373
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:49,750
you have set up this answer on the one

374
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:52,240
way or the other for it to fit well to

375
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:56,920
fit perfectly so that it turns like this

376
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,250
amount I doubt basically so like oh

377
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,250
great

378
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:08,090
he's good to go so he's a poet

379
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,678
I get drivers to compiler get them from

380
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,559
another corner and then you go to read

381
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:16,490
them to read all data and girls like

382
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:20,658
black and then he continues okay so not

383
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,549
black did wrong just black as well and

384
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:28,190
counter for the luxury of these going

385
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:31,990
bust all free of these working pretty

386
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:36,639
much always but not always say that I

387
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:43,070
acutely son to lower the CPU consumption

388
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:46,899
only the consume to between two and nine

389
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:49,700
percent of the CPU so that's quite a

390
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:50,258
intensive usage I just thought that was

391
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,750
weird

392
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:57,919
someone was saying if you have read the

393
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:01,370
slides well can you use I to see we

394
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,889
software there's like what are you with

395
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:06,439
on octopus when I didn't have a real eye

396
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:08,330
to see so you can get those two pins say

397
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,840
that it does not a high to see and dine

398
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:18,220
side there is an i2c emulated unlike

399
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,220
what what are you talking about

400
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:28,320
so here's a device tree and there are

401
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:35,199
full talks on the device tree just like

402
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:37,750
now JSON and the format is pre open but

403
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,160
you may have seen depending on the drive

404
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,350
is like the parameters you put on the

405
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,500
driver when he comes to his thoughts

406
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:47,409
that depends on the driver hey I need a

407
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,730
parameter called T so dart okay thank

408
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:55,300
you it's in the source code you can look

409
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:57,670
at it of course so after all of this you

410
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:02,980
get the vocal - you get support for

411
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:08,950
Leedy - now unify the open wrt device

412
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:12,510
tree is this n't so I know completely

413
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,510
the NP you and go to other solutions

414
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:22,330
that integrate the filter even so that

415
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:24,500
the new scope and the magnetometer and

416
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,770
another device works earn

417
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,669
so the pwf has four chance per hard word

418
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:34,250
but only two of them are active because

419
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:38,510
guy who worked from the board made a

420
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:39,799
dinner device tree and the person may

421
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:43,330
want these paints in this configuration

422
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:45,590
and the chip may use them differently

423
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:49,070
fair enough why not

424
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:55,990
good luck without but you need to

425
00:30:49,070 --> 00:31:01,580
disable the you are a RT to some of them

426
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:05,740
much they you are too so need to disable

427
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,740
to a neighbor another too

428
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:17,220
in develop course among masks guy hey

429
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:21,600
you know I want you to disable the for

430
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,600
two rounds okay so you need to

431
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:31,610
to disable and enable of this he's like

432
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:38,749
what look at that face and these are the

433
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:40,039
last post of the thread so what do we

434
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:42,889
actually need to do here

435
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:46,759
we need to look at how the device tree

436
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:52,639
works device tree works by defining some

437
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:56,269
sort of groups or Assamese give them a

438
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:58,240
meaning so that's like a cross matrix so

439
00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:01,970
these groups are groups of pins

440
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,330
associated with this functionality so

441
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,889
the pins of the you are to half you are

442
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,889
doing the function here - it looks

443
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:14,629
obvious doesn't it we have other pins

444
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:16,939
and PWM 0 which is at P W have 0 then

445
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:21,529
the 1 which is 1 and they all have the

446
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:24,850
name and the function but I do need to

447
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:24,850
disable the function

448
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:36,170
of uart and say that it's pedo um I need

449
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:38,510
to find a whole new set of pins in 2301

450
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:43,070
and the other two which are the you

451
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:47,260
aren't so the people who did this call

452
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:49,760
those pins you Artie - but they could be

453
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:53,750
PWM even now they're called you a year

454
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:57,070
t2 and you like what the

455
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,070
so what you need to do

456
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,100
and these goes through layers first of

457
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:10,200
all you have a chip and then you have

458
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,199
the board so need to find them

459
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,460
and then the code

460
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:23,420
this is managed by the kernel itself and

461
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:26,300
he is where you define the functions you

462
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,790
have a group PW everyone and this may

463
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,470
have all these functions and so on and

464
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:36,230
we're interesting in this one in

465
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:40,400
particular for the you you are to what I

466
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:42,950
want in PWM so I don't have that you are

467
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:48,050
but I have the to PW apps and we need to

468
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:52,120
go to the datasheet to see this and here

469
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,120
we have same thing as in the code

470
00:33:53,850 --> 00:34:06,560
very states that the you are - they may

471
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:09,650
have gpo's pwm we see in this picture

472
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,650
kind of

473
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:16,230
looks that I'm doing something sensible

474
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:20,149
these are the accompany workshop we were

475
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:27,149
trying the power stage of the drone

476
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:29,909
which is a MOSFET works as a power stage

477
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:38,080
for the NGS it goes from the PWM egos

478
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:41,530
the MOSFET it has a roud compensator so

479
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:46,449
Jesus in crash or you just set yourself

480
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:51,520
on fire and we were doing debugging with

481
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:54,989
its butter also called Silas cope and

482
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,989
here you see the

483
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,660
it looks like

484
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,040
the heart rate or someone who sign and

485
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:12,650
when you stop giving power to the engine

486
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,819
the engine becomes out in writer

487
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:18,650
and as they return power so we need to

488
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:21,849
control those things so that it doesn't

489
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,849
work like crap

490
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,370
then we get to the last stage

491
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:36,400
the turning of a PID the pimping of the

492
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,400
PID

493
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:45,210
and this thing's silly but it's the most

494
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:49,350
reliable way of adapting it when you buy

495
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:51,420
it wrong it's already do you not but

496
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:55,100
they don't tell you how they did in

497
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,100
factory and you only need to do it once

498
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,360
so here you block the drawing all the

499
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:02,400
access except for them for one and you

500
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:06,150
trans that one I'm not gonna give you

501
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,780
too many details where PID virtual ease

502
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:15,960
control algorithm dust will well you

503
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:18,270
have a reading and you read your minus

504
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,540
one degrees of inflection won't be a

505
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,540
zero

506
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:29,828
so this algorithm applies the exam just

507
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:32,019
drunk to the ideas to get to zero

508
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:36,609
without going too far it's like the

509
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:40,299
cruise control of a car but times three

510
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:42,538
three chances like this like this like

511
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,538
this

512
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:53,910
okay so interceptor as a hacking tool

513
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:56,160
that are implemented in this room so

514
00:36:53,910 --> 00:37:01,890
this is a controlling telemetry but

515
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:04,078
through Wi-Fi he has an extension of the

516
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:09,470
protocol I design for the other part is

517
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,940
a big console based protocol we because

518
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:14,089
frames

519
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:18,499
Wi-Fi announced in a network that

520
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:23,788
doesn't exist in the payload of beacon

521
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:28,098
and here I sent the control data so this

522
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:28,099
drone also gives you one data

523
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,910
and if you see the mobile this is

524
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:36,900
working I haven't looked at it but you

525
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,670
can see then you have the pilot in

526
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,620
scepter of

527
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:44,160
SSIDs and those networks do not exist

528
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:54,100
the exchanging data through the payload

529
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:57,520
become show you okay I want to do this

530
00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:00,370
but just with a we fear doctor I want to

531
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,740
have more adapters they don't fit so

532
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:06,690
what do we do I go through all the

533
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:09,759
channels just in case I want to run a

534
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:14,680
tool such as boy for Wi-Fi out into a

535
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:17,050
river one of those things so I need to

536
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,990
my interface that are used for drone

537
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:25,170
control and as well as to launch those

538
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:25,169
tools safe

539
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,839
broadcasting our channel I'm blocked

540
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,629
there so I avail of the overlapping of

541
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:37,650
channels and say with a remote control

542
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:38,490
okay I want to change the channel and

543
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,310
they're wrong

544
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:45,868
dreads artists are okay so if I mean 13

545
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:49,819
ago to 12 and so on until I get to a

546
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:55,920
channel I want that is done with AES

547
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:59,569
coding encrypting to protect the

548
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,569
packages and well

549
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:16,000
I can review me a lot airport okay I

550
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,990
need to change the battery because I've

551
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,990
been charging for an hour

552
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,368
he may see

553
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:46,960
control that's the website

554
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,960
you can see it here

555
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:59,118
this is served by the PC PC has a Wi-Fi

556
00:39:52,170 --> 00:40:02,039
network and the becomes go from this USB

557
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:06,029
trial even though it looks like an

558
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:08,760
expensive admit he say USB command I use

559
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:12,240
be more control it could be like a

560
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:15,349
Playstation trolley he works with the

561
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:19,649
joystick kernel mode it reads from down

562
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:21,270
and he converts something to become

563
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,089
frames the whole movement of the leaf

564
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:26,130
different levers and then on the way

565
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:32,640
back since the monitor is injecting a

566
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:34,920
fitting of a safe adapted the I truck

567
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,900
mode and also does it in mantra mode to

568
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,369
talk show packages from the drone that

569
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:44,900
is insane wrong he's giving back its

570
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:44,900
lavatory if I move it

571
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:55,780
and it gives me telemetry in the battery

572
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,779
voltage it's kind of working on pay

573
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:05,290
okay so this year works with the u.s.

574
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:07,270
sockets those from the PC server to

575
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,970
navigate to the browser you got to

576
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:13,180
become friends with the drum and they go

577
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:19,779
to the u.s. sockets that I are

578
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:22,000
representing JSON on the interface so if

579
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:29,080
they want to retain to switch a channel

580
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:31,990
that's so fast here okay plus client

581
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:36,100
mode I have an access point here which

582
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:42,970
is my home both a drum would you see

583
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:46,509
mode so I ask you to go to my normal

584
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:50,709
mode Juicy J channel otherwise unblocked

585
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:53,340
in the client mode channel so now I can

586
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,340
switch the channel

587
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:02,280
so here is beginning to launch the bully

588
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,280
to different very different SSIDs

589
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,749
okay

590
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,150
she liked all about the really

591
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:10,770
yeah Machado she knows lack of you CBN

592
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:23,549
is preguntas so if you have any

593
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:27,120
questions we may begin love ya it

594
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:29,100
no makeup on oh thank you you need to

595
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,890
give me another round of clothes later

596
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:34,549
when I finish properly so other other

597
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,549
any questions

598
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:48,210
hello first of all congratulations I

599
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,029
actually have to question it's two short

600
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:55,529
questions first of all have you thought

601
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:57,869
about selling it founding kickstarter or

602
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:58,729
whatever you wish please do please do

603
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:03,989
have it

604
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:05,339
secondly I found remarkable that you

605
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:06,960
trick the become frames

606
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:09,900
I guess it's quite easy to have that

607
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,019
wrong because if we find the SSID of the

608
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:18,450
to wife as you're using we could inject

609
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:21,089
packages very easily right well there

610
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:25,519
are two ways and I'm gonna say this

611
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:28,469
before the demo which is a bit dangerous

612
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:31,319
please this is an expensive screen

613
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:33,920
let's not damage it and we know that

614
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:37,619
Wi-Fi is unhackable

615
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,599
I'll never deny that but they're

616
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:44,069
different mitigation measures one of

617
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,769
them ciphering another one is a message

618
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:50,670
integrity I dunno you may ingest

619
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:54,258
packages my proposal has not been

620
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,259
developed the final proposal

621
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:00,880
it's something we're really doing is to

622
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:04,960
have a sequence control reject all

623
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:08,710
packages you know it's not that easy

624
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:15,730
please do not do it but that's the way

625
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:18,010
it is we need to check integrity as well

626
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:20,980
as an in sequence number and these can't

627
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:24,130
the others and he's also encrypted with

628
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:26,770
the payers and the code changes every

629
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:31,720
resort he's changed by the normal

630
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:33,759
network in each fight the the keyword

631
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,640
changes because he it I'm like traffic

632
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:41,530
you may get me my keyword so it goes on

633
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,540
those lines however the aim is to use

634
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:48,130
something different than Wi-Fi and I'll

635
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:51,330
leave it there for other talks because

636
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,330
this is to be continued

637
00:45:53,320 --> 00:46:00,430
so I'm gonna do the demo are there any

638
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,740
other questions meanwhile do these are

639
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:08,200
good question by the way if you manage

640
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:10,689
to answer it if you get a better

641
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,069
question I'll give you a book for free

642
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,270
I'm gonna give a book for free to the

643
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,580
best question there's another person

644
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:18,240
over there please rise

645
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,240
raise your hand

646
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:31,080
hello hi so from the Harn world

647
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:37,440
perspective I think is like suicide to

648
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:40,170
use brush and you said of using brush

649
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,609
less easy just to make the drum cooler

650
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:46,700
what were you by the way I like to look

651
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:53,009
at you in the eye

652
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:56,609
well you know to wrong because the

653
00:46:53,010 --> 00:47:01,410
brochure and Jesus o'clock for drones

654
00:46:56,609 --> 00:47:03,900
but they're grateful tiny round the tree

655
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:08,190
fasiq and Jesus with their controller

656

669
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,429
pimping this this morning Arturia

670
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:06,150
okay let's check how this works

671
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:16,530
and this will be actually very short so

672
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,990
please pay attention she won't take a

673
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:21,890
picture please do it now otherwise might

674
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,890
be too late Oh

675
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:36,410
thank you very much let's try again if

676
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:38,950
you don't mind you know I'm kind of

677
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,950
liking it

678
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:49,848
oh I can't believe I'm so clumsy okay

679
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,849
one more and we're done

680
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:58,500
in fact this is him come up in the

681
00:48:56,069 --> 00:49:02,549
slides you can come close and look it

682
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,680
but this sensor does not allow for

683
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:09,329
filter configuration so you need to do a

684
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:16,288
physical filter which is to get to

685
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:18,569
thermoelectric tile bounce and put a

686
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:21,150
little coin there and that was a filter

687
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:22,160
to cut the high frequencies of the

688
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:30,809
activities

689
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:32,960
otherwise this would never fly oh there

690
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:32,960
we go

691
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:48,770
