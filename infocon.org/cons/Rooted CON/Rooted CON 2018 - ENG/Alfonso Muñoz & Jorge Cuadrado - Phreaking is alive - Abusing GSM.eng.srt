mono Mouse and bethought so we'll start

5
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:03,069
I think we've given them enough leeway

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:14,069
I think all of you or most of you know

7
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:20,310

bravado okay we have him Alfonso Alfonso

9
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,669
Jorge as well as Jorge is a giant in the

10
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,370
field so thank you so much please

11
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:33,359
introduce yourselves so anyway at the

12
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,830
end of the presentation please stay in

13
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,229

14
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,198

everyone and thank you for coming

17
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:51,240
that's quite there's very few of us in

18
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:53,460
the room well first of all that were

19
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,949
dying to thank the organizers for giving

20
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,659
us the opportunity to be here once more

21
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,080
I think it's the fifth or sixth time in

22
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,080
a row

23
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:10,840
we'll tell you about this in a minute

24
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,940
the rather complicated thing my name is

25
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:19,000
Alfonso muñoz mind crypt Twitter you can

26
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:22,090
look me up in the Internet and hog

27
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,590
wallow okay he's here with me today I'm

28
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:31,570
lucky enough to have Jorge as a member

29
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:34,479
of my team so do follow him and give him

30
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:38,080
a lot of love okay so what is this talk

31
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,560
about unlike many other talks that you

32
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,729
might attend in cybersecurity

33
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,700
conferences the title is not

34
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:48,810
self-explanatory

35
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:52,180
this is what we will talk about GSM

36
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,280
covered channels using special commands

37
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,830
in order to understand our presentation

38
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:01,388
we'll have to give you some context what

39
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:04,090
how do we arrive here the concepts we

40
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,820
are dealing with and what we will do is

41
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:11,320
just half of the talk so bear with us

42
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:14,560
and then benefits and drawbacks of these

43
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:18,159
methodology we'll have to wait and see

44
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,729
whether we have a new demo effect the

45
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:25,200
shore disclaimer quickly we know that

46
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,200
some of the things we have tested

47
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:32,289
might make some people nervous that is

48
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:36,400
not what we intend to do okay

49
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:39,128
sponsors might get a little uneasy in

50
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,520
the presentation we've done our best to

51
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:45,249
pay attention to the details this is a

52
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,779
talk from from our point of view any

53
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:48,639
doubts you may have even may get in

54
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:50,129
touch nonetheless hope we're not sent to

55
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,199
jail anyway

56
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:57,539
what is the presentation about we will

57
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,539
talk about something called free kings

58
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:12,290
these are techniques that come from a

59
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:14,210
time before high packing this is about

60
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,419
learning and understanding the operation

61
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,409
of telephones of different sorts

62
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:22,240
telecommunication technologies and the

63
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,240
operation of telecommunication operators

64
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,139
this is a very brief presentation we

65
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,240
don't have time to go into the details

66
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:33,199
you probably know the story this is the

67
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:36,800
56 60s and 70s in the US a lot of really

68
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:40,810
clever researchers we have Captain

69
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:44,300
Crunch at the top and his famous whistle

70
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:46,880
2,600 Hertz with printed a few

71
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,850
these are whistles that we have printed

72
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,950
ourselves and we we actually printed a

73
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:56,650
giant one this doesn't broadcast off

74
00:07:51,950 --> 00:08:03,440
that frequency but anyway it's very cool

75
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:08,830
should I blow when I thought I don't

76
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:12,650
know this is like a horn but never mind

77
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,630
so quickly as I say there's been very

78
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,638
relevant people working in this field in

79
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:21,770
the field of electronics communications

80
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,090
we have Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak we

81
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,080
even managed to sell some of their

82
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:31,760
gadgets mr. Mitnick you know the story

83
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:34,150
I'm sure and Here I am blowing with this

84
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,150
whistle

85
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,400
lots of anecdotes everywhere

86
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,150
okay so that was some this is about what

87
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,480
has been happening in Spain we have the

88
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:51,910
hack story project here you have the URL

89
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,120
with some of the months the smartest

90
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,390
people in this country we have the

91
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,580
apostle's which who are very well known

92
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,620
just to illustrate the fact of this very

93
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,570
smart people that have been working on

94
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,310
this for quite a quite some time there

95
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,940
are really exciting thing about our

96
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:18,969
profession is finding out of the world

97
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:21,130
goes well beyond the basics okay so

98
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:25,870
after their very brief introduction let

99
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:29,980
us move into the topic itself this is

100
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:32,770
about two years old we were interested

101
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,570
in understanding as best as possible

102
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,569
everything to do with mobile telephony

103
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,390
and all the elements that are necessary

104
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,820
in those networks in order to in turn

105
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,100
understand the type of attacks that we

106
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,960
could expect

107
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:51,210
I'm sure you've you've been reading the

108
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:55,530
headlines there's lots of projects

109
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,530
focusing on electromagnetic emissions

110
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,610
this all sorts of projects that have to

111
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:10,579
do with the security of mobile telephony

112
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,110
out of all the different attacks there's

113
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:13,579
lots of them we could spend hours

114
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,370
talking about them there's two big

115
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:20,120
families

116
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,769
we have attacks on SS s7 you might

117
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,560
protect everything you might have proper

118
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:26,300
encryption but still you could expect

119
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,310
attacks things could be intercepted

120
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,399
people could see your messages sometimes

121
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,829
we forget this is far more likely than

122
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,430
anyone could think then we have this

123
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:40,310
world which is quite invisible too for

124
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,310
most people and mobile phones have

125
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,219
software there goes beyond the operating

126
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,719
system itself that software is usually

127
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,149
executed at different levels of

128
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,420
permission for example everything to do

129
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:56,240
with radio emissions so someone might

130
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,389
inject something into your mobile phone

131
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,410
and steal things from you so there's

132
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:05,149
lots of attacks so we need to consider

133
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,240
in detail in order to protect ourselves

134
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:11,899
properly and of course I cannot leave

135
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,500
this aside those of you who know better

136
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:19,310
about this field this is one of the

137
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:24,199
earlier designs from 1998 this is a

138
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:26,829
homemade system for sakra for a secret

139
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,829
telephony

140
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:36,720
so everything comes from here we want to

141
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,179
understand all the elements we need if

142
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,229
we want to understand how to protect

143
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:40,919
telecommunications and to be more

144
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:45,029
specific

145
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:48,359
koke will tell you about the actual

146
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:50,629
headset handset we are not going to

147
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:57,839
focus on the network but on on handsets

148
00:11:50,629 --> 00:12:00,929
that's our focus so as I was saying the

149
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,470
presentation relates to a number of

150
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:07,228
conversations that we had so two years

151
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,739
ago we started talking about privacy and

152
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:12,869
we ended up discussing those things that

153
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:17,519
we keep under control you know in our

154
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:20,369
handsets we realized that that was

155
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,079
really difficult to define far from

156
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:24,600
being an easy task there's lots of

157
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,228
things happening behind the scenes so we

158
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,660
came up with this crazy idea we set up a

159
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:32,459
mobile phone ourselves to see what we

160
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:37,679
learn by assembling one of these

161
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:40,228
handsets so when setting it up we were

162
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,539
clear about the limitations we wanted to

163
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:44,189
keep it simple something that could be

164
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:47,309
replicated by people without any

165
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:49,889
advanced knowledge of these technologies

166
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:52,409
and we wanted to make it food to make it

167
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:55,470
functional something that could be used

168
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:58,949
in real life so what you see on the

169
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:01,199
screen is our first prototype on the

170
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:03,059
right-hand side has got its own

171
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:06,118
interface it was fully functional the

172
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:09,379
only thing is that it in my a had to be

173
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:12,629
plugged into the network to analysis fly

174
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:15,869
but it gave us quite a nice quite a few

175
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:18,170
clues regarding our ability to build a

176
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:20,960
handset ourselves

177
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:24,680
so we identified what we wanted to

178
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,660
achieve and after after some time we had

179
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,319
a share with our friends from rooted

180
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:33,650
they offered financing so that we can we

181
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,660
could continue with the project and make

182
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:39,590
some progress on the left-hand side you

183
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,600
see the second stage I said before that

184
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,930
we wanted to keep it simple so we wanted

185
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,670
to recycle some of the thoughts those

186
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:51,469
things that could be harder to build but

187
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:54,650
ordinary people we wanted to keep them

188
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,960
as simple as possible there are speakers

189
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,840
on the microphone are things you can buy

190
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,300
anywhere the batteries a power bank

191
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,530
units with a couple of modifications but

192
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:11,420
they're rather simple ones we kept it

193
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:13,970
really simple to be honest yeah you can

194
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,390
see a more refined model this is not the

195
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:19,040
latest version here you see somewhat

196
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:23,810
more complex interface with more

197
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,620
functionality you will see that

198
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:30,589
underneath we have UNIX this is the

199
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,750
Debian version of Raspberry Pi which

200
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,530
allows us to do development of the same

201
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,360
level as with a conventional computer

202
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,790
with the added benefit of being able to

203
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,350
control things at the same level as you

204
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,760
would control them using a computer

205
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,050
another interesting thing is the size

206
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,860
this is more or less like a smartphone

207
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:55,579
but it's a bit thicker okay it's much

208
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:58,090
bulkier take a look at the casing we

209
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,800
thought this would be a major challenge

210
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:03,710
but if you want to build your own models

211
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,410
using 3d printing that are interesting

212
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:09,140
editors are there I would encourage you

213
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,290
to give it a go because you will be in

214
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,910
for a surprise as I was saying at the

215
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,980
beginning this was the start of the

216
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,040
research that we are presenting here

217
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,040
today

218
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:25,259
but obviously we wouldn't we would like

219
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,939
to see this as a browser beginning

220
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,519
really as a starting point we want to

221
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:33,419
continue with this honey very of you is

222
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:40,589
interested if anyone is willing to lend

223
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:42,689
us a hand in helping us build a mobile

224
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,249
phone which is more transparent we'll

225
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:49,589
give you our contact details so that you

226
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:52,049
can collaborate with us but in case this

227
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:57,409
is not clear we are starting a project

228
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:57,409
to create a free mobile phone

229
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,320
Ramon has forbidden me to say to use the

230
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,260
word bomb it looks like a bomb but it is

231
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,840
a telephone I can assure you we haven't

232
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:15,400
made any attempts to reduce the size of

233
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:17,920
this handset so if you don't like it the

234
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,680
casing can be removed the original

235
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,630
components are there and as I said you

236
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,630
can print it with our 3d printer so

237
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:34,900
we're showing it to prove that this is

238
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:37,420
real okay there is not a theory there is

239
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,730
a very brief introduction okay

240
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,349
something has going to the purpose the

241
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,910
main purpose for this presentation with

242
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,670
all the knowledge that we gathered by

243
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,040
building this handset and we've readied

244
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:55,660
everything we knew beforehand everything

245
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:57,540
we studied on I'll be hacking yes we're

246
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,810
not particularly interested in hacking

247
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,310
mobile telephony networks to have free

248
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,770
telephony that doesn't make any sense

249
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,510
anymore there are good operators there

250
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,449
are good professionals working at very

251
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:15,099
reasonable prices today it doesn't make

252
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:19,030
any sense anymore what does make sense

253
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:21,659
however is to study anonymity and

254
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,660
privacy

255
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:28,240
we wanted to hide ourselves from the

256
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,970
mainstream system there's a lack of

257
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,270
privacy which is very clear we mobile

258
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:38,710
telephony so that was the initial point

259
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:42,840
we had in mind so we will set up cover

260
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:45,610
channels using the GSM network without

261
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,080
acting on the network itself so we

262
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,290
wanted to find out whether this is

263
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,230
feasible we wanted to focus on the

264
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,659
possibility of sending small chunks of

265
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,760
information this is not about sending

266
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:01,180
people episodes for Game of Thrones

267
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,460
far from it we want to send as I say

268
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,860
small chunks of information they may be

269
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,490
small but they may be useful an IP

270
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:12,100
address a tall address a Bitcoin address

271
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,990
whatever things that can be useful to

272
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,060
someone getting the information on the

273
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,610
other on the other side we don't have

274
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,220
that much time to talk about covered

275
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:24,040
channels in detail if you have any

276
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,690
doubts please get in touch so let us

277
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,320
focus on the main subject for this walk

278
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,390
everything you are about to see will

279
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,990
have a couple of demos hopefully without

280
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:37,720
the demo thing so this is the structure

281
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,120
here we have the GSM network we don't

282
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,510
care about the operator we have tested

283
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:47,290
this with all operators in Spain what we

284
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:50,650
will focus is the emission side and the

285
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:53,710
reception side for this we will use the

286
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:57,300
antenna the aerial that we have used in

287
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,300
our mobile telephone

288
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,710
we will try to produce changes through

289
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,850
the antenna through 80 commands by

290
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,860
interacting directly with the antenna so

291
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:11,949
that by working with standard protocols

292
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,689
for the interface we can find out

293
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,110
whether there is a way to introduce the

294
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:19,510
change in the emitter I made the GSM

295
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:22,899
network transmit that change to the

296
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:26,350
receiver so for us the GSM network is a

297
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,660
black box basically so we'll stick to

298
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,689
the standards and if we manage to find

299
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,420
out something something that affects the

300
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:41,080
receiver perfect because that would be a

301
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:44,110
covered channel as such by the way you

302
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,280
can use an a SIM card of any sort you

303
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,280
could use your own SIM card

304
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,120
we can make this this as friendly or

305
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:57,870
hostile as we want but obviously we want

306
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:01,439
to be anonymous as anonymous as possible

307
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,929
we've used anonymous SIM cards and we're

308
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,510
hoping to prove that it is possible to

309
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:09,180
send information for free from the risk

310
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:13,080
from the emitter to the receiver that's

311
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,850
why it's called P hacking so you can

312
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,740
send information from one location to

313
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:20,040
another using the GSM network without

314
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,870
paying a single penny okay hitting the

315
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,790
headlines that that's not our objective

316
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,159
okay our objective as real our real

317
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:30,360
objective is to remain anonymous so

318
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,790
details as Alfonso is saying in our

319
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,070
research we are dealing with the network

320
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:39,000
as a black box and we're focusing on the

321
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:41,540
interfaces so what are the elements in

322
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,540
the interface

323
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,110
on the one hand we have same cars that

324
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,700
Alfonso will mention in a minute in

325
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:54,520
detail and then we have the GSM system

326
00:20:50,700 --> 00:21:00,929
itself in this case we're using this GSM

327
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:03,850
module this interface this chips chipset

328
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:09,400
why we selected this model because of

329
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:13,389
the band's the 850 900 1800 and 1900

330
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,700
megahertz those frequencies allow us to

331
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:19,630
use this handset in basically any

332
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:21,210
country in the world how do we keep the

333
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:25,270
handset under control

334
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,330
the control uses 80 commands these are

335
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:33,700
commands for serial devices rather

336
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:36,550
standard commands and in this case we're

337
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,780
talking about gsm 0 7 0 7 and 0 7 0 5

338
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:43,690
plus another specific one from simcom

339
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:46,090
with these 80 commands we will be able

340
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,220
to have all the functionalities in the

341
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,209
GSM module so the gsm model will allow

342
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:54,700
us to make calls send text messages and

343
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:57,190
multimedia messages using our geo GPS

344
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,080
were connecting to the internet this is

345
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,670
a highly functional module we have only

346
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,610
implemented functionality for phone

347
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,590
calls but the module offers all the

348
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,350
others ok so it's very it's highly

349
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:11,320
flexible for any type of project one of

350
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,178
the things that people usually

351
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,300
overlooked is a range of operating

352
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:18,220
temperatures the module can operate at

353
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,820
any temperature between minus 40 and

354
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,400
plus 85 degrees Celsius Celsius that

355
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,740
means we could use this module and also

356
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,440
if it is properly insulated and that

357
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:32,320
gives us additional benefits in terms of

358
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,800
development last but not least the price

359
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:39,500
you can buy this module in Amazon for 25

360
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:43,990
euros so anyone can afford it really

361
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,990
on the other hand we have the SIM card

362
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:50,570
what we'll tell you about the price for

363
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,590
the whole thing during the demo the SIM

364
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:57,470
card very quickly I am aware of the fact

365
00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:01,039
that this is a sensitive issue you know

366
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,919
that in Spain since 2007 because of our

367
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,830
existing legislation you cannot buy

368
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,470
anonymous SIM cards unfortunately today

369
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,510
it's quite easy to get hold of one we

370
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,130
will not tell you how to get hold of a

371
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:18,470
sim of an anonymous SIM card but there's

372
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:22,340
many ways to do that so as I say I will

373
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:24,740
not give you any details but it would be

374
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,990
enough to say that if you want to make

375
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,750
this more anonymous you can use on only

376
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,650
with sim cars in fact me in many of our

377
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:35,270
tests we have used only with some cars

378
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,140
these are examples of whenever SIM cards

379
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,450
from other countries

380
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,280
ok not from Spain from other countries

381
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,520
ok I want to make that absolutely clear

382
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,850
these are from London let's leave it

383
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,850
there

384
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,630
okay on that note now that we have

385
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,540
seemed interface why do we want to focus

386
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,370
on the Interfaith by the way why do we

387
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,409
want to focus on the gadget itself or

388
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:04,360
not on the network well we have seen in

389
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:07,200
recent years is that traditionally many

390
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,879
devices have been sent here secured

391
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,700
based on people not having access to the

392
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,760
hardware not easy to interact with the

393
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,680
hardware it is either very expensive but

394
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,290
it's very difficult to get hold of or

395
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,490
both things at the same time in recent

396
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,610
years however we've seen a

397
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:27,130
democratization of hardware suddenly it

398
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,870
is much cheaper or much easier to get

399
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,600
hold of devices which in the past were

400
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:34,179
very difficult to obtain the module in

401
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,889
Amazon is 25 euros and it will take a

402
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,140
week 10 years ago

403
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:43,560
I wonder how easy it was it was probably

404
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:46,960
much harder so we have realised

405
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:51,090
30-minute systems the security rules are

406
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:54,340
not valid not anymore they have changed

407
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:55,899
so since we had the GSM antennas we

408
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,800
wanted to know what we could do with

409
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:03,670
them introducing information to try and

410
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:06,159
send packages of data to recovered

411
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,860
Channel so what rules did we apply to

412
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,250
our research now take a look at that

413
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,649
tweet in the corner which is quite

414
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,290
descriptive we took the manual for a

415
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:20,350
module and we audited commands one by

416
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:24,399
one we wanted to find out to what extent

417
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:28,230
the operator trusts us the operator

418
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,570
validates the data that we send to them

419
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:34,300
do the data that we send arrive in the

420
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,189
same shape to the receiver what happens

421
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:41,310
in between those are the questions that

422
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:44,620
we posed if you could speed up

423
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:47,050
this is the document for GSM module this

424
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,699
is the manual that gives us all the

425
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:54,460
guidelines on the commands that can be

426
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:55,060
used for a GSM module we're running out

427
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:01,720
of time

428
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:05,320
keep moving not everything is funny or

429
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:09,490
amusing there's lots of things lots of

430
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,530
details lots of things highlighted so

431
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,240
this is the summary of the things we are

432
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,010
taking into account at the top you see

433
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,720
the commands that we are using at the

434
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,970
bottom those commands which we're not

435
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,250
using but with which we believe are very

436
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:24,430
interesting let me start by the ones

437
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:27,700
we're using a TD and a th these commands

438
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:31,900
allow us to place a phone call and hang

439
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,810
up a t+ clip will show the metadata for

440
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,240
the phone call to the handset activating

441
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:40,810
it it may be the emitter of the receiver

442
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:43,350
then we have the 80-plus clear which

443
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:46,090
allows us not to show the metadata

444
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:49,719
although the previous command might be

445
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:51,780
activated and the 80-plus mooring when

446
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,000
the phone call reaches the destination

447
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:57,340
we may know through a message that the

448
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,320
network will send us with all of these

449
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,870
commands we will be able to set up a

450
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:06,370
simple communication flow okay just for

451
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:07,870
four commands I go back to this but let

452
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,389
me tell you about the other ones these

453
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:12,280
ones were not using but we believe that

454
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,720
very interesting in our context are not

455
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,879
useful but in other contexts they may be

456
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,070
for example we have the 80 plus VDS the

457
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,270
second command which will allow us to

458
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:27,520
generate DTMF tones we haven't used an

459
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,280
article because we would need to

460
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,889
establish to place a phone call and the

461
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,370
main purpose was not to pay any money

462
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:40,070
for the phone call

463
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:42,289
we have the 80 plus X insole which will

464
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,110
allow us to get error codes for

465
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:48,980
standards implemented by the vendor the

466
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:51,110
model vendor in our case our module is

467
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,289
rather standard but in others things may

468
00:27:51,110 --> 00:28:00,289
change so talking about the other

469
00:27:54,289 --> 00:28:02,029
commands will help you speed up this is

470
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:03,220
the metadata that we could get from any

471
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:07,100
phone call

472
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,480
we never the phone call depending on the

473
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,330
way this terminated would be use a

474
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,980
number of codes here we would have two

475
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:20,120
bits in our demos we haven't used this

476
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:22,220
you have two bits just by hanging up we

477
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,350
need to manipulate the way we terminate

478
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,970
the phone call in terms of time that

479
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,969
doesn't pay off

480
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:41,039
and then in these two data sheets we see

481
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:42,960
what is happening in GSM we were

482
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,779
assuming the loss of data we'll get to

483
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,570
the receiver and yet most data is

484
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:52,789
intercepted halfway through or is

485
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:59,149
treated locally so there's very few data

486
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:59,149
we could get hold off and move on

487
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:06,810
okay so we'll we'll start with the demos

488
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:10,210
we're running out of time very quickly

489
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:13,389
let us show you this demo as part of the

490
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:17,710
video because it takes a while and we'll

491
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:21,430
do it in in real terms here unless up it

492
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,990
works the one we're about to see out of

493
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,150
all the commands that we have discovered

494
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:29,770
this is the simplest one but the most

495
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:35,320
stable approach this is a summary we

496
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:39,070
will be using myth calls on a hidden

497
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,290
number we automate this I set up a

498
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:46,990
coding system if we want to send bit one

499
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:49,659
we make a number call Misco with hidden

500
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:52,210
number or miss call with visible number

501
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,700
those numbers by the way are fake

502
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,430
numbers in case someone wants to do

503
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:00,820
something with these the system is what

504
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:03,310
you see there total costs 60 euros plus

505
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:06,600
a cardboard box but it's basically the

506
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:10,929
GSM antenna which is 20 and an Arduino

507
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,040
device which is 20 60 euros in total so

508
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,810
you set up the call

509
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,820
you're hung up you get the information

510
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,090
and there it goes let me show you the

511
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,090
video

512
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,750
cyclic of the audio

513
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,019
when you hear that sound is like a

514
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,639
missed call if you take a look at that

515
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:39,710
on the left-hand side we have the

516
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:41,979
receiver on the right we have the

517
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,980
emitter

518
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:52,470
you hear Koki making some coffee in the

519
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,840
background but never mind that we got

520
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:58,260
bored with this demo there it goes

521
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:01,139
that's the coffee thing but if you count

522
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,170
the time between different signals seven

523
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,600
seconds on average the miss goal should

524
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:08,970
be something instantaneous but then

525
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,340
there are Network delays for the

526
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,860
receiver to get it in a stable manner

527
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,370
we're talking about seven seconds in

528
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:20,820
between okay the fact is we've done this

529
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:23,250
in several locations and it works so

530
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:27,600
nothing else this is all the setup you

531
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:31,100
use the sim card of your liking here we

532
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,020
send in 91 bits as of the top of my head

533
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,439
for Rudy 2018 this takes about 10

534
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,090
minutes

535
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,090
okay so we'll skip the details

536
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,759
okay we'll move on

537
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:53,399
questions you may have how much

538
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:59,149
information can be sent and how stable

539
00:31:53,399 --> 00:32:02,340
is this is of all the techniques we have

540
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:07,199
used the speed the best speed is this

541
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,879
one 10 11 12 bits per minute we haven't

542
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,799
included all variants because you can

543
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:12,689
combine different techniques in the

544
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,960
worst case scenario this can be improved

545
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:18,389
in the worst case scenario with without

546
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,359
investment 60 euros we will be talking

547
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:23,340
about 12 bits per minute and the

548
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,230
question would be what can you do with

549
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,039
12 bits per a minute it's not useful in

550
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:30,899
any way is that completely useless it's

551
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,840
not just one more technique to set up a

552
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:34,979
cover channel well there's a number of

553
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,529
things we would like to mention about

554
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,109
our 12 bits per minute means that in 3

555
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:43,470
minutes you can send an IP address which

556
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:45,330
is cool because you can use a server

557
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,559
with information you can send an IP

558
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,889
address and you connect to the server

559
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,499
you could send GPS coordinates at all

560
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:54,508
address whatever if we're not just

561
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:56,249
talking about one minute because we're

562
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:59,700
not in a hurry in an hour

563
00:32:56,249 --> 00:33:02,399
we will be able to send 720 bits which

564
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:06,989
is enough to do interesting things if we

565
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:08,998
talked about one day we could be we

566
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:10,529
might be able to send images that are at

567
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:13,049
a reasonable resolution so it's

568
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:16,019
interesting the question you might have

569
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:18,710
in your mind right now is how stable is

570
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,710
this setup

571
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,999
if it's only a minute it's not good

572
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:28,459
enough the thing is that we should be

573
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:31,879
stable enough for it to last for an hour

574
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:34,399
or a day in the last five months okay

575
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:34,789
we've been doing tests for the last five

576
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,889
months

577
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:38,239
none of the SIM cards we've used and I

578
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,579
can tell you we've used a large number

579
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:43,699
of them none of those SIM cards has been

580
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:45,769
blocked ever we will not tell you about

581
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:48,829
what the operator does we have no idea

582
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:51,009
actually about the way they manage

583
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:53,448
things but SIM cards were not blocked

584
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:56,119
during these five months we've done

585
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:58,579
tests for about an hour a day okay

586
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,279
there's seven 720 bits and as I say

587
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:05,989
nothing cause however have have ever

588
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:09,230
been blocked for my fingers so we sent

589
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:15,289
them we managed to send information for

590
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:17,659
two days so there were like some 30 4560

591
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:19,339
law schools so we just stopped that

592
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,829
because we was just a proof of concept

593
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:24,589
and we just didn't want to bother anyone

594
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:27,259
and we don't know how operator telecom

595
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:29,929
operator manages that so the objective

596
00:34:27,259 --> 00:34:32,000
our objective is to make it stable in an

597
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:35,710
hour and we prove that

598
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,719
so therefore the research well and

599
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,579
hypotheses have been verified and what

600
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,768
have we done ever since well we've been

601
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,240
working on amplification techniques that

602
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:46,668
is to say to send out more information

603
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,699
over a shorter period of time I may not

604
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:55,339
be wanting to use to be there for an

605
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:57,819
hour and I just don't want to use SIM

606
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:59,750
card for such a long time so

607
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:01,430
amplification techniques we've been

608
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,980
doing some research we are doing some

609
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,558
other research right now as well

610
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,589
so we've been working on 2g we just

611
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:13,880
don't need to work on the Internet

612
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:17,328
2g is enough we'll show you a demo we

613
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,940
are using virtual numbers to make the

614
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:21,599
system

615
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:26,130
Chiba and then we have some time so we

616
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,950
will make a demo mixing 2g and Internet

617
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,890
so that you can take it home with you

618
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:38,250
and try it over there so let us move on

619
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:39,990
to virtual numbers now so in a cover

620
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,270
channel in covered channel we are

621
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:45,569
interested in capability once we have

622
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:48,420
developed these base methods then we

623
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:52,529
moved on to finding out how to amplify

624
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:55,170
that so for that the first thing that

625
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:57,299
comes to mind is well if you have an

626
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:59,730
antenna the SIM card sending out

627
00:35:57,299 --> 00:36:01,349
information why not using ten of them

628
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:05,819
therefore you will be sending

629
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:08,880
information ten times okay if nothing

630
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:11,279
prevents you from doing that so well we

631
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,460
continue researching and then we found

632
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,309
virtual numbers and at the time I didn't

633
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:25,039
know what virtual numbers were virtual

634
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:28,920
numbers well in this case we used

635
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:32,130
telecom companies that in a free manner

636
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,470
and potentially anonymous give you this

637
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:38,369
type of numbers how does a virtual

638
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:40,200
number work well at least they make the

639
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:42,109
user you make a cell phone when you call

640
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,419
that virtual number and that number

641
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:48,288
redirect the calls forwards they go to a

642
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:53,010
another number but every tool for that

643
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:57,390
so in our case we took 16 virtual

644
00:36:53,010 --> 00:37:02,990
numbers each number represents a binary

645
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:05,788
value of 4 bits so since from the mirror

646
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:08,759
we make a call to one of those virtual

647
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:12,779
numbers the virtual number will send the

648
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:15,930
call to the receiver so we are

649
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:18,539
amplifying by for the number of

650
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,669
information that we are sending out one

651
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:21,630
of very interesting characteristic of

652
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,930
these

653
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:28,589
is that if we are using virtual numbers

654
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:31,379
therefore anonymous we will be detaching

655
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:31,920
the coupling the receiver from the

656
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,049
mirror

657
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,259
so therefore the receiver wouldn't know

658
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:40,470
about who is the actual emitter which is

659
00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:42,809
very important for anonymity and the

660
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,959
other way around we could also do this

661
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:48,059
anonymity between the receiver and the

662
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,250
mirror which could be very interesting

663
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:55,380
in some scenarios so in this case

664
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,809
transmission is 28 beats per minute

665
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:03,059
taking its account seven holes per

666
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:07,859
minute which is much better okay so now

667
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:09,900
we move on to a live demo so December is

668
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:11,460
the following because we are very hand

669
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,190
tight we just want to spend lots of

670
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,500
money in antennas so we they use virtual

671
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:20,099
numbers which are free numbers there are

672
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,500
many companies suffering - or do you pay

673
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:25,680
for them and each virtual number was

674
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,089
like 2 or 3 euros okay well if you pay 4

675
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,558
times you have to give your credit card

676
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:34,440
number but does as much as you have to

677
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:37,799
provide ok so we have a video probably

678
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:42,480
will fail ok therefore let us try to do

679
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:44,130
a live demo it is more complex and

680
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,829
that's why we wanted to show it to you

681
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:49,910
the previous demo voice mode was simpler

682
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:53,069
but this one we will just see the

683
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:57,029
virtual numbers so we have problems with

684
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:59,990
these cheap electronics these cables

685
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:03,240
which are also no quality also the

686
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:06,779
telecom operator in between will give us

687
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,879
some delay and problems of coverage as

688
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:11,880
well but anyway I tells you what we will

689
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,589
do we will be using Arduino we will send

690
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,420
out the protocol so we have the two

691
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:17,578
antennas for the receiver and from the

692
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,619
emitter and then if everything goes

693
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:19,819
right

694
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:22,539
I don't know whether everything will

695
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:29,240
come right or not it takes three minutes

696
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:33,079
we will just use a very shocking music

697
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:37,788
okay so does you well so that it is

698
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,329
friendlier to follow please okay if it

699
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:41,630
works

700
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:43,099
give us a big round of applause because

701
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,730
we are not sure whether we'll break or

702
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:45,730
nuts okay

703
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,750
okay

704
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:18,709
so by the time we've seen that at least

705
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:20,930
two blocks have been sent out okay we

706
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:22,190
will title music not before that which

707
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:26,270
doesn't want to go into coitus

708
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:28,520
interruptus so it takes some time to

709
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:30,829
launch the information it takes like 20

710
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,849
seconds to connect to the network okay

711
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:37,760
worst-case scenario taking 20 seconds to

712
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:43,030
connect okay shall play the music in

713
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:46,030
general we wait we wait oh I'm

714
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,030
frightened

715
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,110
okay I risk it

716
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,220
okay if it works we'll be over the moon

717
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:20,330
all right we have sent out the first

718
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:20,330
four bits okay the first ck

719
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:29,848
okay if we send someone does not receive

720
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:32,630
a CK you cannot launch anything

721
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:32,630
oh no it's working

722
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:50,460
well basically I am anticipating that we

723
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:54,569
will be sending 32-bits

724
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:57,180
with only 8 law school law schools to go

725
00:41:54,569 --> 00:42:00,020
to that with your ordinary SIM cards we

726
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:05,098
are using the technique of amplifying

727
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:07,440
virtual numbers okay so D on the right

728
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:13,380
we have the receiver on the left we have

729
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:16,260
the ammeter we will tell you why it

730
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,440
takes longer than the video we showed

731
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,440
before

732
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:39,170
well here we depend on very many factors

733
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:41,809
well it is the most complex the most

734
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:44,630
complicated but we just wanted to show

735
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:46,249
it to you okay the one over was works

736
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,670
and it was not very exciting just

737
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:48,669
because of that

738
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:57,340
so we tested it this morning six or

739
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:01,960
seven times and then went to be honest

740
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:04,750
it only works half of the times how

741
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:09,100
we're doing with time Drummond but to

742
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:14,220
try it again if it doesn't work okay

743
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:18,520
video while some coverage has been lost

744
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:20,109
okay disconnected from the network okay

745
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,570
this the module the module has

746
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:27,510
disconnected has been disconnected but

747
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:27,510
we just wanted you to see the flow okay

748
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:27,340
but basically what you do well virtual

749
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,580
numbers are amplified by four and you

750
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:32,020
receive the same protocol that we

751
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:34,569
mentioned before if you don't have any

752
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:38,800
network connection connectivity issues

753
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:42,700
then this is what happens and then let

754
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,100
us move on to the end seventies demo

755
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:48,339
will have sent out 32 bits by making

756
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:50,790
aides nos course we could have coded

757
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:55,600
anything but we decided to code

758
00:44:50,790 --> 00:45:00,370
shortener which is routed 2018 yeah

759
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:04,270
British 18 so basically this takes us to

760
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:05,770
a tor hidden service with mechanisms

761
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:08,290
such as this one or such as the previous

762
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,940
one if we are ready to wait for longer

763
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,950
we will not be depending on a third

764
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,420
party and we could send out whatever we

765
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:18,189
want to send out it's just a question of

766
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:21,160
time waiting so well we just had these

767
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,960
Brenda Hakka thing that this is

768
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,480
information that we sent out so the

769
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,690
concept is clear which is the purpose of

770
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,520
this presentation and now to what we are

771
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:33,340
about to finish we move on to another

772
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,040
demo we also want to share with you

773
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,810
other amplification techniques into G's

774
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,270
do you need to find a way to do it

775
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:43,299
through virtual numbers to Center has

776
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:45,700
much more information per minute okay to

777
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,770
run the risk that the more parties of

778
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:50,379
things you have in between well the more

779
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:52,810
likely you are to fail but if you just

780
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:55,660
don't mind to use the Internet well you

781
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:58,810
could just do so do other type of

782
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:00,940
systems well I'm sure that you are aware

783
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:04,000
of some services and devices on the

784
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:07,060
internet that can help you make holes so

785
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,730
if you use shuttin you can find lots of

786
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:12,190
services free services and free calls

787
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:14,860
that is relatively said you can do

788
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:18,120
coding systems

789
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:21,580
the next demo we have focused on

790
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,830
something that any of you could do that

791
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:27,580
is to say well using this proofing of

792
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:31,029
the color ID so we will be using the

793
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,870
capacity to modify to change the name of

794
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,630
the color

795
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:37,600
well I'm sure that many of you are aware

796
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,190
of these this is possible many internet

797
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,759
services allows you to do that we will

798
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:45,400
be using that capability not only to use

799
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:49,090
the color ID that we want but also to

800
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:51,720
have a covert channel covered channel so

801
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:55,390
if you make this quick calculation

802
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:58,029
notice if you could just modify the

803
00:46:55,390 --> 00:47:01,120
color ID which is often made up of nine

804
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:03,520
digits in an ideal world where all the

805
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,700
numbers will be valid we would be able

806
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,740
to hide nine bits so that means that one

807
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,950
loss code will be enough to send out

808
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:15,490
twenty nine bits of information so for

809
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:18,759
instance an IP address so it is quite

810
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:22,600
interesting and to finish off okay we

811
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:28,680
move on to a demo to see how we can use

812
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:31,680
this hybrid system to G doing caller ID

813
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,680
spoofing

814
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,440
we'll be coding a URL with the lost code

815
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:45,119
and this is what I will be sending out

816
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:51,690
that URL will come with some hidden

817
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:54,390
information what URL want to use well

818
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:57,180
there are many of them out there we will

819
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:59,700
be using any URL that allows us to

820
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,348
introduce a parameter to fill that

821
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,509
parameter with whatever we want to fill

822
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:06,480
it with and by the time the server will

823
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:08,790
be drawn nothing will go wrong it will

824
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,420
take it as valid well there are many

825
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:16,380
websites many places where you can do

826
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:19,530
this not to harm anyone we have just

827
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,690
used Google okay you just take the

828
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:24,150
parameter you introduce it to Google and

829
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:30,770
then we have added some encrypted

830
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:35,579
information here I'm going to generate

831
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:39,150
small shortener okay I hope I will get

832
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:42,450
it right I hope it is not taken I hope

833
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:47,970
I'm lucky enough and it is free oh yeah

834
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:51,750
this one is free so what we just did we

835
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:58,290
just developed this program that shifts

836
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:58,950
URL into phone number so 2zs okay see if

837
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:03,869
it works

838
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:06,629
so shortener is to the s and i did some

839
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:08,849
magic and i turned those bits into a

840
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:11,700
cell phone number so i have that number

841
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:14,160
that will be the caller number calling

842
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,319
number and then I need something that

843
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,328
allows me to do the caller ID is poofing

844
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,839
and for that we will be using quite a

845
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:23,970
turbot system which is loss goals

846
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:26,578
comm there are very many of them on the

847
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:29,339
internet we are showing this one just in

848
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:33,140
case you just want to take a look at it

849
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:36,410
is a turbot place so

850
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:42,170
place okay so this is the color number

851
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:44,509
and the well imagine that this is my

852
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:47,030
telephone this is not my telephone

853
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:49,400
number okay because you're hackers okay

854
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:52,610
so this is a virtual number pointing at

855
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,960
my actual number this is the karcher you

856
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,930
know that this culture can be easily

857
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,540
broken so this thing that can be

858
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:02,149
automated but anyway we wanted to show

859
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:04,100
it to you manually so that you'll see

860
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:05,990
that it's no difficult so the difficult

861
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:12,560
thing here is just to introduce the

862
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:14,660
right capture you see wrong code okay we

863
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:22,120
just copy the virtual number okay this

864
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:22,120
is very quick q double are ij6

865
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:33,930
oh that was not the number oh okay

866
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:38,790
if it once it would make a call oh can

867
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:43,910
you see it do you kind of see it not

868
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:43,910
releasing it can you see the number Oh

869
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:54,150
ha

870
00:50:54,270 --> 00:51:01,610
do you like this one well if you like

871
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,610
that one I can see that one

872
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:12,220
okay I'm friend yet your disposal okay

873
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,220
I'm free here for you

874
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:20,480
okay I will make another cold do you

875
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:22,810
know that this is expensive okay pull

876
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,810
again

877
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:32,190
let's call

878
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,770
imagine that I don't get a cool

879
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:48,790
can you see it okay that's the number

880
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:02,600
wonderful so now the idea is once we

881
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:05,450
have that number

882
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:08,330
well it is trusted this is that very

883
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:12,680
same number so we just needed to recover

884
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:15,640
information from that number URL then we

885
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,640
introduced the number

886
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:26,480
mobile number this is the number on top

887
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,480
okay this is the fake okay

888
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,149
and this is follow me so it has

889
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,760
recovered information that we sent out

890
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:41,640
no mystery there so these techniques

891
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,460
will have a sense out roused up to

892
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,490
twenty nine bits per law school well

893
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,490
just to mix it to use it together with

894
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:51,990
the internet we have sent out these

895
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:54,330
shortener so this connects through

896
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:56,310
Google and then we've recovered that

897
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:58,980
parameter and the parameter that we'll

898
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:03,390
have to use for this demo I hope the

899
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:07,290
cable works okay so what we have

900
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:12,379
introduced in that parameter is an ID oh

901
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:15,890
IP address hidden service from tor

902
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:19,050
latitude a telephone number a big-enough

903
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:21,150
message someone by making combination

904
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:23,460
and through a lost code you can just

905
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:27,360
send out whatever you want to send out

906
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:32,520
so it is very easy to do very very say

907
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:36,270
all right so we are nearly finishing so

908
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:40,650
summary of all this sub it like to say

909
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:43,380
thanks to the lower prices of hardening

910
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,850
is possible or hardware it is possible

911
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,770
to make this type of research

912
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:50,400
well the demo that we showed you is very

913
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:53,220
stable but it's a bit slow if you don't

914
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,020
have time issues you can send out quite

915
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,600
a lot of information over an hour or

916
00:53:55,020 --> 00:54:00,960
over a day and to send out the specific

917
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:03,089
things well this is wonderful if you

918
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,880
want to complicate your life well you

919
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:08,400
will you can try amplification

920
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,960
techniques and if you are not that much

921
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,420
interested you just want to achieve your

922
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,700
objective to judge use internet services

923
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,890
and then use the mobile phone as an

924
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,390
alternative channel to make it a bit

925
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:20,400
more complicated well the full

926
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:23,220
investment the whole investments for all

927
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,680
this is around 60 euros so I guess that

928
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:28,500
anyone can afford it so this is a from

929
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:32,549
Alice so I hope you find it at least

930
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:34,630
interesting any questions that you may

931
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,789
have we are just

932
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:38,970
and those addresses okay thank you very

933
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:38,970
much

934
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:51,420
well I think Rahman was to make a draw

935
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:54,000
suffered like to highlight a decided

936
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:59,099
components this is a casing we made a

937
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:02,910
casing with 3d printers so it is a bit

938
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:05,339
long but we just decided to make it long

939
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,859
if you don't like it well you can't just

940
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:09,779
open it and reuse the components the

941
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:14,190
different parts so the greatest

942
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:18,170
challenge here is that we didn't find

943
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:18,170
many projects on the Internet

944
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,049
well they actually the Triax are

945
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:29,089
profound on the internet to create your

946
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:31,519
own mobile phone we just tried them we

947
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:35,779
just didn't but they are not working but

948
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:40,419
it was most time-consuming can you see

949
00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:40,420
it now oh it's upside down

950
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,920
someone wanted salutes healthy is that

951
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:55,030
out of all the projects on the Internet

952
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:57,220
the main problem was battery so the

953
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:59,560
battery issue was not resolved okay we

954
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:01,959
just wanted to have a autonomous a

955
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:06,009
standalone battery and now we want to

956
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:08,320
move on to fix Oh to have like better

957
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:14,110
microphone and better speakers okay we

958
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:19,780
are using low-cost speakers okay as well

959
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:22,150
we will continue to improve it so there

960
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:25,060
is only one trick so there are three

961
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:29,380
boxes here one is operational and the

962
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:31,290
other two are just to be set up okay so

963
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:35,850
well let us see

964
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:35,850
okay so only one of them is set up

965
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,080
otay

966
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:52,519
so we have opened a random.org which is

967
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:55,098
the most democratic and that is

968
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:56,450
redirected to the local house so that I

969
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:59,240
become the winner

970
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:03,319
Nana so when the number of people that

971
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,500
have confirmed this a 1825 we are

972
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:08,450
extremely happy with the number of

973
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:17,660
participants this year

974
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:21,399
this is oh oh I lost it I am just so

975
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,399
stupid give me a minute

976
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:29,029
well for instance I don't know we can

977
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:31,990
pick like unusual family numbers such as

978
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,990
for solace

979
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:54,410
but I'm also not gonna weigh after an

980
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:57,040
online mortgage okay give me a second to

981
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:57,040
that online

982
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:29,450
disculpe sk para llegar a la lista ellos

983
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:31,750
Cody Vaz tengo que apologies to the list

984
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:34,910
of coats I have to connect to another

985
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:47,630
and that were kind of well authenticated

986
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:49,190
there so give me a sec bear with me si

987
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:50,809
por favor Salinas saying that Assad on

988
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:52,910
el poeta a telephone or mobile is

989
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:54,650
somebody citrusy in these mobile phone

990
00:59:52,910 --> 01:00:00,348
projects we just want to build a

991
00:59:54,650 --> 01:00:03,349
community and we want to publish as soon

992
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:05,059
as possible or soon the steps to follow

993
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:07,160
for that okay we are ready

994
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:08,930
okay let us in the red random to see

995
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,240
who's the winner because we have the

996
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:16,190
three rooms perhaps a person is the

997
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:21,348
physically present at this room okay we

998
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:25,509
will generate the number okay so we'll

999
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:35,980
click on the generate and generate so

1000
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:35,980
1804 1-800 for Brahman no no no is of me

1001
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:47,650
so who's going to see unique ID

1002
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:56,500
okay you may come down if you so wish Oh

1003
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:06,990
you have cut off our demo just for these

1004
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:09,710
Oh answer to me not come back I will not

1005

okay okay tomorrow tomorrow we will be

1020
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:40,260
giving away the other two months okay

1021
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:42,030
these ones are amounted all right so

1022
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,880
thank you very much for your attention

1023
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:47,010
oh sorry we didn't open the

1024
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:53,430
question-and-answer session

1025
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:56,870
okay who's got a question oh yeah I

1026
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:56,870
forgot about questions as well

1027
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:05,640
just a quick question do you think that

1028
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:08,670
that work orgy future evolution of this

1029
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:12,720
work will have an impact legally in

1030
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:15,240
terms well in terms of regulation 4G SMS

1031
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,160
and telecom operators no I don't think

1032
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:20,240
so because we are not doing we are

1033
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,680
respecting we're buying buys norms of

1034
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,779
regulations and well the most basic

1035
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:28,259
mechanism that reduces and lost goal if

1036
01:03:24,779 --> 01:03:29,759
you make it hostile well operators will

1037
01:03:28,259 --> 01:03:31,920
just see whether you are moving away

1038
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:33,690
from the regulation or not and I would

1039
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,480
lock your sim but as I showed you in the

1040
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:38,549
last demo you only need eight law

1041
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,519
schools to sends out information well I

1042
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:42,690
have people who are all the time

1043
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:46,140
terminating or hanging up their calls

1044
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:49,890
okay for me to call them back so well if

1045
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:51,450
you want to send out and IP address

1046
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:53,549
that's not a problem if you are a

1047
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:56,220
hostile well the telecom operator could

1048
01:03:53,549 --> 01:03:58,410
just block your SIM cards you are just

1049
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:01,049
not taking advantage of any failure of

1050
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:02,480
any vulnerability so that's because you

1051
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:07,410
are just taking advantage of

1052
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:10,769
connectivity or the way NABARD work all

1053
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:15,899
right so two more questions in the room

1054
01:04:10,769 --> 01:04:18,959
okay good morning very well done what a

1055
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:24,299
curious piece of work I guess it can be

1056
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:27,089
striking for operators large number of

1057
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:30,200
missed calls hiding not hiding the

1058
01:04:27,089 --> 01:04:33,420
number if the operator pays attention

1059
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:35,399
they might focus on this and in the

1060
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,170
first case it would be quite easy to get

1061
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:40,700
hold of the information that is sent

1062
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,700
unless you are encrypting it

1063
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:48,420
well you know this is like any other

1064
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,460
covered channel basically if the

1065
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:52,560
operator sees there is something odd

1066
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:56,220
happening in the network they might look

1067
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:57,950
into it would that be a way to encrypt

1068
01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:00,720
the information

1069
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:02,848
well we're focusing on the cover channel

1070
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,919
encryption is taking for granted that

1071
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:06,900
doesn't make any difference you encrypt

1072
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:13,290
the information but that doesn't add any

1073
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:16,339
complexity the interesting part here is

1074
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:18,660
that the sim we were expecting to have

1075
01:05:16,339 --> 01:05:25,950
we expected you would love this state

1076
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:28,160
and that's why we used SIM cards many of

1077
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:31,368
the tests were conducted using my own

1078
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:35,000
SIM card with my name related to it

1079
01:05:31,369 --> 01:05:35,000
thank you so much
