1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
but Victor and Jose come from telefónica

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:11,190
I met Victor a long time ago when

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:14,099
working in different projects I'll be

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,550
controlling your time from there Thank

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:22,320
You Rahman hello everyone my name is

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:26,609
Victor Monty yo I'm product I'm a

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,260
product manager at 11 paths for those of

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,590
you who don't know too much about their

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,350
ISM from the product side although I am

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,450
in charge of taking to the market ideas

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,940
and methodologies that we use in our

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:44,430
lives and those methodologies that are

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,039
used by our engineering teams he's my

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,940
colleague Jose progress

15
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,530
he works for one of our labs in Malaga

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,829
I'm an innovation analyst at the

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,170
Innovation Lab in Malaga I'm in fact I'm

18
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,739
coordinating several technology projects

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,690
that are still in place the main purpose

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,690
of this presentation is to tell you

21
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,650
about the things with you in eleven

22
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,740
months we'll be using some practical

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,600
examples it's the first presentation of

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,990
the lunch so we'll try to keep you awake

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,990
anyway

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,080
there's no surprise if I say that mobile

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,850
phones have changed everything in our

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,530
environment they've changed the way we

29
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,530
communicate they've changed people

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,520
there's more than 2 billion mobile

31
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:41,089
phones in the world today where more

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:46,100
than 190 billion applications downloaded

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:50,600
every year it's quite a lot in terms of

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:54,440
retail market revenues so attackers

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,669
obviously focus on those areas of

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,670
business which are profitable

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,250
at the end of the day we're talking

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,990
about more than 5 million new

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:13,560
obligations every year 9 thousand of

40
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,920
those uploaded daily most of them are

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,070
legitimate but a lot of them have

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,339
vulnerable versions some can circumvent

43
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,070
the security methods Google and Apple

44
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,730
have in place to inject Trojans adware

45
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,730
and ransomware

46
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,460
so attackers needs to make an effort I

47
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:46,980
know to minimize the amount of work they

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:53,490
need to carry out they have their own

49
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:57,290
industrial processes in place these

50
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,290
applications are developing so fast

51
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:05,060
they've also fast at obviously all of

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,060
them have bugs and flaws in their design

53
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,810
many of these applications the ones that

54
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,269
are legitimate also contain bugs and

55
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,050
vulnerabilities we need to be able to

56
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,050
protect them

57
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:27,890
we need to ensure that these

58
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,890
applications are free of owner abilities

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,890
in order to avoid other stakeholders

60
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,450
from attacking them and attacking the

61
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,548
end users through those applications

62
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,119
these are some examples of recent

63
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:46,200
incidents where bugs were found for

64
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:50,610
example in Instagram data was leaked for

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,048
certain celebrities this is something

66
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,000
that could have been combined with a

67
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:58,290
social engineering attack in order to

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,049
get hold of credentials in a massive way

69
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:10,048
this affected a singer Selena Gomez who

70
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:11,819
is now with Justin Bieber and that may

71
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,299
have had an impact a serious impact on

72
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,298
her privacy

73
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:25,160
we as eleven powers are devoted to

74
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:25,160
creating tools on creating processes

75
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,669
which make it as light which make life

76
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:41,900
as difficult as possible for attackers

77
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:43,580
to do the job we analyze networks we

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,520
analyze connections we analyze

79
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,039
advertisers we had a lie we analyzed all

80
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,750
sorts of things and as I said at the

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:57,139
beginning we'll show you some examples

82
00:04:50,750 --> 00:05:02,630
of the work we do I'll show you some

83
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:06,190
videos I meant to do this online but I'm

84
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,190
afraid I'll have to use these videos

85
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,229
this is a tacit platform this is what we

86
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:18,089
have downloaded 10 million applications

87
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:20,998
so far I'll show you the analysis that

88
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:23,639
we have carried out first of all we have

89
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:26,999
created a platform let me explain what

90
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:30,119
this is all about that allows us to do

91
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:32,399
searches on applications based on

92
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:36,569
certain criteria in this case we've

93
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:40,020
search by title but you can use other

94
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,729
criteria for the search now you can

95
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,930
search the email address for the

96
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:48,029
developer the name the description the

97
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:53,490
number of classes use the name of those

98
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:55,370
classes and that allows us to detect all

99
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,399
those applications are pretend to be

100
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,999
legitimate and created by us to start

101
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,589
with we also developed an analyzing tool

102
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:07,589
for static vulnerabilities I think the

103
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:11,279
video was moving to alright so as I say

104
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:14,779
in analyzer to detect static

105
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,779
vulnerabilities in this example

106
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,069
we're trying to detect a malpractice

107
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,110
which is quite common which is hugg

108
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:25,330
hard-coding certain elements within the

109
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,849
application itself we have developed a

110
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:32,469
grammar and allows us to do a search

111
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:37,688
based on these parameters as you see on

112
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:39,189
the screen search for something that

113
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,849
meets all of these requirements this is

114
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:46,629
what we do

115
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:48,569
and that gives us a list here we have

116
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:53,710
detected that there is an application

117
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:57,340
which has its own IP I'm not sure you

118
00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:03,359
can read it from the back sorry about

119
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,359
this I'm not a Mac user myself

120
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:30,230
so these IPS internal

121
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,870
but the administrator for the website

122
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:42,010
itself we can do other types of searches

123
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,010
I'm the video

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,070
this is an internal IP address

125
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,790
this could be an internal administration

126
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:23,380
IP address and this so this information

127
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:28,060
shouldn't be visible through the

128
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:30,190
application this analyzer allows us to

129
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,990
detect applications which have not been

130
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,789
programmed properly which may be

131
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,120
displaying sensible sensitive

132
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:39,939
information through HTTP here we see

133
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:49,030
that the user ID and the passwords are

134
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:51,070
hard-coded on our sent unencoded here we

135
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:56,560
see that the application has its own

136
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:58,450
internal IP addresses but it is sending

137
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,109
those connections the user ID and the

138
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,270
password using HTTP in the open these

139
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:08,500
are poor practices for security

140
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:10,600
practices that should be avoided at all

141
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,330
costs and this is precisely what we aim

142
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:19,120
at detecting you know we need to ensure

143
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:22,800
that these bugs are not present the it

144
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,800
is not just about information leakage

145
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:30,550
we could see a certificate leak

146
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,569
replication did

147
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,569
this is the place where the credentials

148
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:45,800
are stored this is a VPN client and this

149
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,880
is probably where you stored all the

150
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,880
credentials to connect

151
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,849
take it easy don't worry

152
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:16,150
in this case we have a detected another

153
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:18,910
one well you have a dot key file it has

154
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:22,500
been encoded but it is the private key

155
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,500
for a certificate

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,490
they said necessary to have that

157
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,360
information within the application well

158
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,360
we don't think so

159
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:52,320
we've also set up a vulnerability search

160
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:55,060
engine that allows us to detect serious

161
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,540
vulnerabilities or or slight other

162
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,540
abilities

163
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,520
and we have analyzed 10,000,000

164
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,520
applications

165
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,860
after the static analysis we have

166
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:21,829
detected vulnerabilities in 80 million

167
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:25,309
obligations in some cases these are

168
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,748
quite severe vulnerabilities any

169
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,639
potential attackers to extract

170
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:30,559
information or details that could

171
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:36,620
compromise the company the application

172
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:43,459
of the uses just to give you some facts

173
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:47,589
and figures around 15% of all

174
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,589
applications are in a critical State

175
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,589
this is a breakdown of all those

176
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,888
applications that are in a critical

177
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,749
condition condition there are some

178
00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:01,029
industries like the finance industry and

179
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:04,550
healthcare industry which are specially

180
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:08,139
affected by this type of applications

181
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,139
with critical vulnerabilities

182
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,820
some more facts and figures on the type

183
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,519
of vulnerabilities that we have

184
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:26,339
identified in some cases they have to do

185
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,440
with the what we call the quality of the

186
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:33,980
code this is poor practices when coding

187
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,990
things are exported 200 components

188
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:40,680
permissions are requested whether they

189
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,209
are not necessary so information which

190
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:49,829
is not really necessary which is

191
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:51,899
requested that could have an impact and

192
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:53,459
in fact some of these applications are

193
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,760
so poorly coded that they might be

194
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,680
detected as malware amongst some of the

195
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:04,319
most remarkable vulnerabilities that we

196
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:06,359
have been able to detect we have

197
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,630
critical items that have to do with data

198
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:14,610
storage and privacy we've also seen that

199
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:18,230
there are many non non secured

200
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,230
communication channels between

201
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,519
applications and the backend

202
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:29,240
but above all there's a lot of

203
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,180
self-signed certificates the problem

204
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,850
with self-signed certificates is that if

205
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,010
you lose that private key for that

206
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:39,200
application you lose control altogether

207
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,839
you will not be able to generate updates

208
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:47,470
or anything like that another thing

209
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:52,209
we've seen quite often has to do with

210
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,209
XSS vulnerabilities

211
00:13:55,569 --> 00:14:02,149
applications can be installed using

212
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:04,160
older versions so you might be adhering

213
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:06,709
to best practices but since you're able

214
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,120
to install all the versions of certain

215
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,119
applications you will be in danger

216
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:17,930
another thing is dynamic code loading

217
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:20,209
your application has to rely on external

218
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:25,060
code that comes from other external

219
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:27,920
applications this is what droppers use

220
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:33,018
this is an application that is tools

221
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:35,479
legitimately but then it does establish

222
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:38,329
a connection to a dodgy website it is

223
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,649
toss a payload and the malware is

224
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:46,519
installed using that method you really

225
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:50,139
need to be sure about the need to have

226
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,139
dynamic code loading

227
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,309
and then we have inappropriate use of

228
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:00,309
platforms

229
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:07,969
sometimes the user may enable the backup

230
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:10,160
mode for their applications and bleed to

231
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:16,419
a potential extraction of a financial

232
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:21,079
information credentials certificates and

233
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:24,410
we would allow the malware to export

234
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:29,029
components any data that the application

235
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:32,449
uses in your phone could be accessed by

236
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:35,019
other applications installed in the same

237
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:35,019
handset

238
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:43,089
so if you're connecting to the internet

239
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:46,269
using your own data that data could be

240
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,499
uploaded to a server through another

241
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:49,959
application in your phone

242
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:53,799
another video on how to find suspicious

243
00:15:49,959 --> 00:16:00,099
applications going back into our search

244
00:15:53,799 --> 00:16:08,499
engine the first thing we do is a basic

245
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:10,769
search for applications there are

246
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:13,059
certain applications that are called

247
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,889
flashlights and they don't have a

248
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:16,118
permission to use the flashlight from

249
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:18,910
the from the smartphone so that

250
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:21,129
obviously is suspicious if you cannot

251
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,839
use it as a light as a flash light

252
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:28,359
obviously that application is not

253
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:30,009
legitimate let me go back here I see

254
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:32,980
that it can access the Internet it

255
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,790
connects us the camera but it doesn't

256
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,549
really make any sense

257
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:40,269
it cannot access the flash the LED

258
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:44,139
flashing light things I get more

259
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:45,089
sophisticated this is the clerk and

260
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:50,230
attacker

261
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:52,649
type of incident applying to Android

262
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,649
versions

263
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:01,899
here we have an application layer and

264
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,860
any anything you click on on the screen

265
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:08,260
is collected by the application is

266
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:15,119
captured by the information these are

267
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:15,119
some examples about this type of attack

268
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:22,630
so here we see that the attacker

269
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:25,980
overlays a grid on your screen an

270
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:33,010
invisible grid of course capturing

271
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:35,559
whatever you pointed on the screen in

272
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:39,370
order to detect this we can we can

273
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:41,620
launch a query to see what result is

274
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,678
returned to nayaki no permit an affair

275
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:48,070
esto don't a pareo a most eponymous esta

276
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:54,250
consulta a lock one so we run a query

277
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:56,470
here and we tell the system that we are

278
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,500
looking for applications that have

279
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:02,800
permission to do this system and that

280
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:07,090
window in this case we've refined the

281
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,760
search down with narrow down to the day

282
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:13,870
on the search to applications that have

283
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:20,110
permissions to send text messages if you

284
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:23,649
have an application that can get tokens

285
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:28,300
using text messages and the application

286
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:32,200
is buggy you could be attacked this is

287
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,879
the icon for a trusted cloud that means

288
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,160
that these applications have been

289
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,640
withdrawn from the market

290
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,580
they've been detected as suspicious or

291
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,260
unsafe and they're no longer available

292
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,600
but obviously we have copies of those

293
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,800
applications in order to simulate

294
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,800
attacks on them

295
00:18:52,540 --> 00:19:00,830
here we see we have lots of emissions

296
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:04,370
the application can access the system

297
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:07,370
alert windows captured text messages

298
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,689
receive text messages and send a lot of

299
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:13,179
emissions that don't really make any

300
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,180
sense for an application of this sort

301
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,380
the results of our analysis by the way

302
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:24,260
are published in our blog at 11 paths

303
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:29,510
and that takes me to the next section in

304
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:31,490
my presentation this is another category

305
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,000
of analysis that we also included in our

306
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,000
services

307
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:46,300
we have answers that can cost up to a

308
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,300
thousand euros or you know

309
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:57,229
people are paying a thousand euros for

310
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,179
their handset and yet they want to to

311
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,950
use dodgy applications in order to avoid

312
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:06,850
paying five euros for the legitimate

313
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:15,530
ones so they keep using Google to find

314
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:17,299
the apk binary obviously if you buy the

315
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,520
legitimate application through Google

316
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,650
Market you will have the security layer

317
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:27,080
implemented if you go for the fake ones

318
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:30,370
you won't in most cases in this example

319
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:37,549
we were looking for this obligation

320
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:39,500
Android apq apk world this is one of the

321
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:41,770
main sources for malware in mobile

322
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,770
phones

323
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,799
so here we have the website

324
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,930
that allows you to download an illegal

325
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:58,240
copy of that application Sudduth we do

326
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:01,000
that we download the application and we

327
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,860
analyze it the main purpose of this

328
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,680
application is not to give you a free

329
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,270
version of the legitimate game far from

330
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,210
it

331
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:14,530
this application has its own purpose

332
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:17,290
which is monetizing the effort the

333
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,090
developers have made getting money

334
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:22,840
through the vulnerabilities in your

335
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:28,060
telephone in this case once we have to

336
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:31,030
unload it the application but you know

337
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,460
that Android applications have this

338
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:39,810
format this is the application itself

339
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:42,910
and an Android manifest dot XML which is

340
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,500
the part establishing the permissions

341
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,770
that are needed for the application to

342
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,560
be executed I must go home so if we take

343
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:53,650
a look at the app enter the permissions

344
00:21:50,560 --> 00:22:02,050
of that app we will do that through it

345
00:21:53,650 --> 00:22:05,820
to XML a PK and here we see that this

346
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:09,370
app because of these permissions looks

347
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:12,970
complicated because the permissions are

348
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:16,000
quite elevated says receives boots

349
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:20,800
complete and power on it means that once

350
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:25,020
it is on the mobile and also one see but

351
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:30,129
the mobile phone is blocked and then

352
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:32,110
will do now a process that we often do

353
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:38,110
automatically but we will do that

354
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:40,810
manually now we will look at what the

355
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:45,070
first class which is being x1 which is

356
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:49,230
mine activity and then we will be using

357
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:52,720
text to hard utility that will help us

358
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,930
transform that class

359
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:00,930
into this other format so that we can

360
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:04,600
make a more detailed analysis about the

361
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:09,280
intention or the target of this app we

362
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:13,709
use these tools okay we generate these

363
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,710
jar file takes some time

364
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,580
and once we have the dockyard file

365
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:31,580
we open the j-d Java compiler and then

366
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:34,210
we browse through the different classes

367
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:39,918
of the package so if we open this file

368
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:45,169
we see a number of classes we go to W P

369
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:49,990
legal Marvel and that is where we will

370
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:49,990
be running to see the type of browsing

371
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:58,400
so we'll have this class here well this

372
00:23:53,630 --> 00:24:03,140
is very poorly seen if so the name is

373
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:07,250
site name acitivity okay that is a typo

374
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:12,919
derisive mistake made by the Android

375
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:16,520
developer so instead of set site main

376
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:20,840
activity says main effectivity so it

377
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:24,850
means that we could look up the error to

378
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:29,240
find the apps that have that class name

379
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:36,320
so therefore we would be able to make

380
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:38,360
contributions coming from well we will

381
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,250
make attribution to other apps coming

382
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:45,178
from the same source if we analyze the

383
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:49,760
up

384
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:51,169
we that very number

385
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,160
[Music]

386
00:24:51,169 --> 00:25:02,780
classes kind of a great

387
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:05,390
my nature the coins a currency when you

388
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,310
register they give you a name peak hey

389
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,850
and you can insert as a kind of

390
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:14,629
advertising in your apps so therefore if

391
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:17,169
you in fact browsers or mobile apps in

392
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:21,830
this case what you do all these apps

393
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:26,570
will do the mining for you and they will

394
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:29,290
get currency and whatever it sizing is

395
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:32,179
generating less and less revenue whereas

396
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:34,940
cryptocurrencies are generating higher

397
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:37,880
revenues so attackers use this type of

398
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,160
things to carry out their attacks so if

399
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:44,170
we take a look at service now let us

400
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,870
take a look at the a peak in which is

401
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:51,700
being used in this case by the attacker

402
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:57,100
to monetize his attack so this is the

403
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:58,930
apk which is being used for this mining

404
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:04,570
activity

405
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:04,570
alright so now

406
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:17,700
okay we will run that in Android

407
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:22,070
emulator and once we start the app that

408
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:26,880
we don't know the people because he does

409
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:30,360
CPU lease at 13% now the moment we

410
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:34,200
started mining starts and then we will

411
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:39,000
also have like pop-up messages with

412
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,760
advertising to download the premium

413
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,040
product so it is mining and you can say

414
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,250
well no problem what is this up to in

415
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:51,960
what they are doing absolutely nothing

416
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:56,940
but we see how the CPU is significantly

417
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:58,559
going up so in this case you come and

418
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,010
say what this application is not running

419
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,530
is not working it is doing nothing at

420
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:10,710
all for me but actually this has started

421
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:14,340
a service behind it and this service

422
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:19,140
will be doing mining in the background

423
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:24,860
even if the app is not status so does

424
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,860
the way the attacker is persistent

425
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,990
so that would be fair enough

426
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:42,160
so we've done that manually but in these

427
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:42,160
markers turns will have hundreds of apps

428
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:47,200
downloading them all could be tedious

429
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:57,908
and even if it will do that we think

430
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:01,809
cool or with any other crawling program

431
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:05,379
many of these apps come with JavaScript

432
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:07,450
which is interpreted through Q or W get

433
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:10,840
if you do that you will not be getting

434
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:13,239
the hyperlinks we may use tassets that's

435
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:17,109
what we do SATs 11 paths but you could

436
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:20,409
do two things one to click on each of

437
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:22,978
the hyperlinks which is quite tedious I

438
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:28,450
don't recommend you do that

439
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:31,299
or you could also do like a humma bird

440
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,639
that is to say someone tooling click on

441
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:35,879
your behalf would clean that clip for

442
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:40,238
you and then loading the apps for you

443
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:44,259
how am I going to do this humma to use

444
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:46,239
this homer bird when we have an DePalma

445
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:51,460
for apps and then we do that through

446
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:53,889
selling new tool and through XPath so

447
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:58,950
they all have a label of expats if we

448
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:58,949
open up Chrome and we click on this we

449
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:07,619
can see we know that this link is this

450
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:12,369
call to action as this is class of

451
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:17,519
JavaScript oh sorry this is Travie me

452
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:17,519
crazy okay this makes driving me crazy

453
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:35,340
as I was saying XPath to get the link to

454
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:38,189
click on it and then you make a script

455
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:41,370
in Python to open up the chrome with the

456
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,260
selenium controller we will look for the

457
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:47,158
call to action and I will say click

458
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:48,059
click click and then in a kind of a

459
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,059
handcraft

460
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:56,340
manner or if the site is complicated

461
00:29:51,059 --> 00:30:00,870
meaning that it has terrible script this

462
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:07,529
is what facilitates the download so we

463
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:11,870
do well if we want to see it live wait

464
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:11,870
and see how simple it is

465
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:24,390
okay this is such a website and

466
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:27,810
automatically it locks on and fan losses

467
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:33,810
as I say to control it like this in this

468
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:37,730
way or if you go to test it to go do it

469
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,730
in a more simpler manner

470
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,080
so we into previous up

471
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:49,799
we could come back to it and say give me

472
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:53,519
all the apps that are sent with the same

473
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:56,039
certificate or in this case we've also

474
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,799
seen a class which is said mine

475
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:01,499
acitivity we could come and say well

476
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:05,009
give me all the apps the belong to the

477
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:07,049
class side up acitivity and these would

478
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:09,149
allow us to identify the same mistake

479
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:10,408
changing the certificate is simple but

480
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:12,840
when it comes to changing the

481
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:18,149
application that would require changing

482
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:21,809
the full code so this is the way we used

483
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:24,589
to identify malware with Internet tools

484
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:24,589
available to us

485
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:35,060
and now I'd like to give her to my

486
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:38,030
colleague Jose this is one of the things

487
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,600
the analysis activities that we do at

488
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,790
11:00

489
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,209
paths and we do it not only to analyze

490
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:46,310
suspicious patterns malware and

491
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:48,650
vulnerabilities but we also would like

492
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:51,040
to share with you knowledge is carried

493
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:57,430
out by my colleague about ad networks

494
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,430
all right so thank you very much

495
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:05,889
that's a burlap same as when we

496
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:07,418
conceptualize toss it we just really

497
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:09,399
wanted to see what happened within the

498
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:11,919
market with mobile apps and we wanted to

499
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:14,408
have an overview of that and this

500
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,429
protein sample app we are trying to

501
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:21,340
analyze to see what is happening with

502
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:23,679
advertising in mobile apps but you all

503
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:27,399
know these that whenever developer was

504
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,320
small in size he's up he's got several

505
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:32,350
options available to him the first one

506
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,200
the most conventional one is advertising

507
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:38,738
but craft or mining is taking away quite

508
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,950
a lot of share nowadays then we also

509
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:44,700
have other means which are not that

510
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:47,109
legal which is the selling of data and

511
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,859
subscription of registration to premium

512
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:56,939
services so often when we want to

513
00:32:50,859 --> 00:33:01,720
monetize our up whether it is legit

514
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:04,389
alleged or a widget so with a legit we

515
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:09,359
mean spam or something aggressive for

516
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:12,129
the user in most cases we require to

517
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:15,759
resort to an ad network which is a

518
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:20,738
company that delivers on-demand

519
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:23,080
advertising then you give some space to

520
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:25,419
the agency and the agency delivers the

521
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,609
ads for you but to attackers to when

522
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:29,470
they want to monetize their apps when

523
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:33,369
they either produce or build their own

524
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:37,720
apps also just resort to the technique

525
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:42,029
of repackaging they take use an app

526
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:45,029
which is popular the three packages and

527
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:45,029
publishes

528
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:53,199
and set their own advertising as well

529
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,580
Victor mentioned before do you never

530
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,600
know what you are done noted when Jews

531
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:00,540
and I run up from the internet so these

532
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,330
type of apps that have been repackaged

533
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:08,110
by Atticus often come with highly

534
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:10,569
aggressive advertising who is well paid

535
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,850
very well paid they I'm not looking for

536
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:16,510
using experience they are looking for a

537
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:22,029
number of clicks and few minutes of

538
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:27,850
video streaming so we do sister million

539
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:32,140
apps we try and detect whether they came

540
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:36,549
with advertising or not we realize that

541
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:40,029
over 4.1 million apps have advertising

542
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:44,920
which is quite an high number and the

543
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:47,650
next question is how are they used they

544
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:51,880
have embedded advertising but what type

545
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:55,780
of advertising would weigh how much

546
00:34:51,880 --> 00:35:00,280
advertising very quickly I will describe

547
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:02,200
the research study that record a job

548
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:06,610
first of all we wanted a second look at

549
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:09,370
the ad networks out there so in the

550
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,830
beginning we selected some 14 ad

551
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:14,230
networks which is carry high number in

552
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:16,450
the second iteration we could see that

553
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:19,090
there was a good number of catalogs out

554
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:22,810
there however the market share was

555
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:27,010
taking up by the 12 top ones okay so

556
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:30,400
therefore we decided to selectors just

557
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:32,980
stop and then we carried out detailed

558
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,650
analysis of SDKs

559
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,780
which libraries provided to you by an

560
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,300
advertising manager so that you will

561
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,339
import them into your development and so

562
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,890
that you can insert advertising one

563
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:48,940
better resizing in a simple manner when

564
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:54,009
we studied SDKs by using tacit we could

565
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:56,770
see whether an app came with AdWords ad

566
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,839
networks or not and as I was saying we

567
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,780
were also interested in finding out

568
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:11,320
about the use that was being made of the

569
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:14,320
ad network last we wanted to see whether

570
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:21,400
we could translate that into an app

571
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:23,500
because Jesus wants to see the type of

572
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,220
advertising that came in with a specific

573
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,220
up

574
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,610
the verse the first thing that we did

575
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:46,970
was just to detect presence of ad

576
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:51,230
networks we will do static analysis Rudy

577
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:53,419
and jinda Victor share review before the

578
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,030
first thing that we did was to take into

579
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:01,430
account was to take a look at the

580
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:03,830
activity that was being used this

581
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:06,710
allowed us to cover for most of the

582
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:09,799
abner wealth and to find out about the

583
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:12,590
presence of it so having an ad network

584
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,680
does not mean that you will be launching

585
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:19,100
it so the second criterion that we used

586
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,000
was analysis of the code we took a look

587
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:26,868
D we analyzed the type of classes and

588
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:31,010
name of the classes so we could see that

589
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:35,900
called methods and then that it also and

590
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:39,830
very different as KZ classes it was very

591
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:42,800
tedious to go through all the SDKs

592
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:44,840
provided by each of the ad networks and

593
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,580
the different versions of them and then

594
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:51,050
last we double-checked the permissions

595
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:54,710
permission using a set of permissions

596
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:59,660
does not entail that you use a specific

597
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:01,850
st k but if the SDK requires a couple of

598
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,790
permissions if you don't have those

599
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:08,890
permissions the advertising will not be

600
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,890
nudged this is kind of a double check so

601
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,869
what is information that we got as a

602
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,300
result of this study well first of all I

603
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:23,690
wanted just to check which was the usual

604
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:26,090
or the standard number of SDKs so we

605
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:30,560
could see that that number the most

606
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:33,650
common number was two when some SDKs buy

607
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,920
you more for videos others buy you more

608
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:39,369
for banner so most people have a main

609
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,590
one and the

610
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:47,000
actually what we find suspicious are

611
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:52,190
those apps that have four or more than

612
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,890
four SDKs so when we studied these 10

613
00:38:52,190 --> 00:39:02,450
million apps we could see that over 500

614
00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:04,839
of them have 15 Puma SDKs so highly

615
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,839
suspicious

616
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:12,820
as a result of this study we developed a

617
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,820
tool

618
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:20,640
it's a

619
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:32,849
use the database of traffic enabling us

620
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:32,849
to make queries real-time

621
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:43,900
so once we huddle those apps and what

622
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:47,680
once we could see which app used SDK for

623
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,779
demo we produce a number of metrics to

624
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,739
find out about they use be made of an

625
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:57,430
SDK and also to assess the Sumner's

626
00:39:53,739 --> 00:40:00,299
of the apps so let me explain this graph

627
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:05,769
this is about the total number of apps

628
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:08,829
that use a network number mean downloads

629
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:13,959
of those apps the percent of those apps

630
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:17,289
there are dead there having killed by

631
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:21,549
Google and then the mean days alive

632
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:26,890
before that an average of 50 51 days

633
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:30,969
potentially malicious app will be with

634
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:34,118
person artist for an average of 50 days

635
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:38,589
so curious cases Facebook not just

636
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:41,890
market share so fiber it is the least

637
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:45,339
used I hope that there is no no one from

638
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:49,868
Fiverr here however Fiverr is topping

639
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:52,410
the list in terms of average standard so

640
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:57,700
these may take you to think that people

641
00:40:52,410 --> 00:41:02,190
upload apps Zanna read through a number

642
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:07,808
of mechanisms and then when we analyze

643
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:11,469
fever in detail we could also see that

644
00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:16,140
it was also the lowest in terms of up

645
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:20,440
Steph that also the mean number of Av

646
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:24,578
it's also quite low in the rank in terms

647
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,619
of averaging writing this is the best

648
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:30,900
values I'm not going to make any

649
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:33,900
advertising but in principle fiber looks

650
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,900
sound

651
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,299
so this also tells us about the

652
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:46,390
healthiness of sdk also tells us about

653
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:51,220
the level of security of it we also

654
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:59,670
wanted to find out how invasive the data

655
00:41:51,220 --> 00:42:03,160
SDK was for that we have this option

656
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:07,570
giving us in this type of information so

657
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:11,339
we don't know the advertising and we can

658
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:17,440
see the average consumption in megabytes

659
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:20,410
mean consumption in megabytes and the

660
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,320
rec impact on your wallet for each of

661
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:25,720
the apps detected for a network which

662
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:31,030
are still an automatic listing or

663
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:35,430
catalog in five levels so number one at

664
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:38,080
most invasive up stay open up browsers

665
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:44,730
open up videos that you cannot eliminate

666
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:44,730
and based on that we made ranking

667
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,480
so this one has a lot from group 1 group

668
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:57,680
2 this is all the non negative

669
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:59,360
assessments negative result fever comes

670
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,399
out

671
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:06,140
better because it uses type for

672
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:13,400
advertising which is banner type

673
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:15,440
advertising and as I was said before we

674
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,130
just really want to see what happens

675
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:25,700
with an app when dudes and loaded I will

676
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:28,600
turn down a couple of apps I would be

677
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,600
using them as examples

678
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,450
so this a bit slow

679
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:44,420
so we also added additional information

680
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,870
that may be relevant from the user and

681
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,550
discuss the size and permissions so I

682
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:53,450
don't know what this app does for you

683
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:55,910
but it has permissions to access Wi-Fi

684
00:43:53,450 --> 00:44:01,640
network to network doesn't look

685
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:07,520
suspicious however it uses one of the

686
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:12,230
most invasive SDKs it uses this startup

687
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:15,200
it consumes quite a lot of data and here

688
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:18,200
we see the type of attacks that have

689
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,379
been detected and I have another example

690
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,379
here

691
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:29,640
this this is enough food

692
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:37,500
advice for pet care or tips for pet care

693
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,670
I just would like to mention that

694
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:50,600
advertising is taken into account in the

695
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:58,460
world of Avis because some SDKs such as

696
00:44:50,600 --> 00:45:04,040
a push if you scan and up with SDK most

697
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:08,180
Avis detected has well so here we see

698
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:15,140
the signs we see the permissions so this

699
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:19,580
app has full SDKs that is to say ad from

700
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:23,290
four different networks a rating has

701
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,290
been given to each of them

702
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:33,810
and

703
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:35,790
from their rating is produced so this is

704
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:37,040
an interesting huh because when I ask

705
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:41,730
for permission

706
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:47,190
this is what I found so it uses this

707
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:51,590
boot complete permission this helps it

708
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:55,500
detects that the system has been started

709
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:59,970
it also has a permission for weight lock

710
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:04,050
it will keep the CPU alive in case the

711
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:09,779
device gets blocked and then we'll have

712
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:14,640
duplicated we can still do this this and

713
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:18,300
now the device to send in push

714
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,900
notifications to the mobile phone after

715
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,900
seeing that

716
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:30,940
so considering the map of permission of

717
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:34,089
the Sun we could think that it does

718
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:37,530
Krypton mining as well as advertises so

719
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:41,920
nowadays there is kind of a war between

720
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:45,069
advertising and adblocks so sometimes

721
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:49,119
they resort to most difficult technique

722
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:52,029
so but techniques for instance facts

723
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,910
truth through DNS ins they change the

724
00:46:52,030 --> 00:47:02,260
name of the domains so that advertising

725
00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:06,040
is not detected and to finish off we

726
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:10,030
also made an automated ranking that

727
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:14,790
allows us to trace the soundness or the

728
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:19,270
health of each of the markets over time

729
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:21,099
so that we can see the tendency of users

730
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,740
when it comes to using this type of

731
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:26,170
market so we can see that some of them

732
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:29,669
follow a positive trend for instance as

733
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,670
in the case of fever

734
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:40,260
so this allows us to trace the workings

735
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:44,890
of them all right so this presentation

736
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:47,380
is intended as showing that applications

737
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:50,650
should not be looked at from a single

738
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:53,470
vector that is to say I will leave an

739
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:56,020
LBD video whether it is mobile or not

740
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,669
whether it is suspicious or not and in

741
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:01,000
this case whether you are taking

742
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:04,480
advantage of advertising or not so we

743
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,710
just want to take a look at it from an

744
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:11,380
overall view point and we add 11 paths

745
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:14,910
through a single source we can produce a

746
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:17,380
we can make different types of analysis

747
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:23,009
so and I hope that you like this

748
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:28,480
presentation we are always looking for

749
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:32,140
talent at 11 path especially through

750
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:37,800
these participants and as I say we would

751
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:37,799
like you to belong to our small family I

752
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:44,920
hope that you like this presentation

753
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:46,900
have rights because because we are a bit

754
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,320
pressed for time and I am to blame for

755
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,400
that

756
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:53,940
not the speakers we will take a question

757
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,940
one question

758
00:48:54,799 --> 00:49:01,339
well if there are no questions we move

759
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:01,339
on thank you
