6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,120
very much they've been working and

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,730
helping us since the beginning as -

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,980
orange so the people sitting on the

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,730
first round

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:43,648
sponsors responses of the three rooms

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:48,059
Telefonica checkpoints may be only

12
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:52,620
interested in the security room but they

13
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:55,820
have increased the funding they also

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:01,140
sponsor the other two from CNN is

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:04,110
platinum sponsor that means his sponsor

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,030
of both events the manager and acumen

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,590
this very difficult would be very

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:13,520
difficult to have developers events have

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:17,310
preferred them and the other sponsors

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,880
called a sponsors office Pacific from

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,780
the festival those specialty security

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,020
rooms and the other one city sponsored

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,900
see box D bubbles do you know that it is

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,530
very important room for us because we

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:39,659
just want to have the full cycle so we

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:42,750
just want that rule to be there on time

27
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,000
Capgemini studies capacity pressure

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:50,530
would tell words and security sentinel

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,509
and by security sylva sponsors

30
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:57,350
only one day you sponsor the White

31
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:59,810
Rabbit fruit so congratulations again to

32
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:05,210
the white review to people anja massa

33
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:07,759
you know that and we have a very kind of

34
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,679
a familiar relationship with them we are

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,050
good friends

36
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:15,770
turbulent haven't you to talk to them

37
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,540
for boundaries exploits etc so Jose

38
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,970
thank you very much for being here your

39
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,079
presentations are always wonderful so

40
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,080
please introduce yourself

41
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:38,709
so today we are here with you my name is

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,860
Jose Sylvie I am a principal penetration

43
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:44,380
tester security researcher well probably

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,130
some of you have met me before have

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,720
attended some of my workshops or

46
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,990
presentations I was about to say well

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,290
that I have or have had a block because

48
00:02:52,990 --> 00:03:00,100
I don't feel it very often but still the

49
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:03,850
name of it is been tested yes so it

50
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:07,060
doesn't want to waste any more time on

51
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:11,170
that and I'm going to take a step

52
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:14,200
forward and kind of has spoiled the last

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:17,130
part of my presentation so what I will

54
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,130
be telling you

55
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,869
well what about Smee discovering a

56
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,370
number of things that has sent it out to

57
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:33,390
a couple of back mountains and well they

58
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:36,330
fixed it both on Facebook and Dropbox I

59
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:39,329
sold it out to other parties but I

60
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,640
decided not to fix it so at the end of

61
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,540
my presentation by the time we will have

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,609
seen everything

63
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,390
do you have seen the link between the

64
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,370
different pieces you will see why I sent

65
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,798
the results of my research and the

66
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:57,180
experience that I had with it it was my

67
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:02,130
first experience with bamboo but because

68
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:05,190
before that I was doing pen testing so

69
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,530
what I say I'm new into the field of

70
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,380
mountains and I haven't sent out many

71
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,760
things there alright so how does his

72
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,918
story start ok the story starts

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,079
traveling to a remote country I was

74
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:23,280
going there with a colleague we were

75
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,440
there to carry out an audit so a remote

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:31,919
country where everyone drives faster

77
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:35,010
than myself so we visited a client we

78
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:40,880
were that odious number of apps and

79
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:44,639
devices and some of the application was

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,419
admin console and I found something

81
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,410
similar to this ok what this is

82
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,409
fictional ok

83
00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:04,310
so the admin panel had kind of a search

84
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:07,490
box for will you could look up users I

85
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,650
guess that they were company users and

86
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,470
like I said it was linked to a directory

87
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,210
but caught my attention was that the

88
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,260
language that you could use for your

89
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,719
search was tremendously rich you could

90
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,050
look up a name of a person but you could

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,390
also specify and say ok find all the

92
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,060
names starting with a or including

93
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,280
letter T ok so the kind of search that

94
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:39,140
you could do was a very complex one

95
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:41,000
so therefore when ice when crime came

96
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,640
out so how many of you are aware of

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,630
crime well few people how many of you

98
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:51,289
have exploded crime well less people

99
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:57,400
then as I say crime came to mind and now

100
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:57,400
it's happening why crime is an attack

101
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,140
which is about the instructive

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,420
informations for a side side channel but

103
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:10,130
it's a side channel side channel well

104
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,650
when people talk about and try to

105
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,540
explain such channel they use the

106
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,280
example of the Pentagon and the number

107
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:22,730
of pizzas that were ordered by night I

108
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,119
have an alternative example to explain

109
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,760
it

110
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,870
imagine the politician having a car and

111
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:35,180
a home okay so the next day he's got her

112
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:38,690
car and home and the next day he's got a

113
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:42,110
home and her house sports car holiday

114
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:45,590
home a castle and the private jet well

115
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,990
what happened there well we haven't seen

116
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,349
the envelope with the caching it but

117
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,390
obviously there's been some hash around

118
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,850
some okay the China channel in this case

119
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,490
would be the property of this politician

120
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:01,190
okay this is what the side channel is

121
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,900
about so meaning that you don't know

122
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,040
what has happened you haven't seen what

123
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,229
has happened but something in the

124
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,830
environment tells you that something has

125
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:14,570
happened and that gives you know how us

126
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:17,060
to or helps you understand kind of what

127
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,219
has happened so if we extrapolate that

128
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,680
to remember Brown so for instance when

129
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:25,070
you click on the browser to ask a

130
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,640
browser to visit this website first of

131
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:31,909
all it connects to see what is the IP

132
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:34,510
then it locks on to that IP and then it

133
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,310
brings with it an HTML code which is

134
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:41,469
randomized in your computer to put it

135
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:45,680
simply simple fund and your computer

136
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:49,130
again finds the resources needed

137
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:56,780
Brenda and to show you scripts images

138
00:07:49,130 --> 00:08:01,880
yes sis to name it if you open up a

139
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:03,590
sniffer and you take a look at that from

140
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,449
the network you will see something like

141
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:09,258
that on the screen

142
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:11,150
well these data are encrypted I said

143
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:14,330
well we cannot really see anything on

144
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:16,460
those TLS well this is not entirely true

145
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,099
you cannot release it data but you can

146
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:23,900
see other things and that has been used

147
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:25,850
to come to or structure channels such as

148
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,659
this one for instance you can see the

149
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:32,260
name the DNS okay you can also see the

150
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:37,159
IPS you can also see the certificates

151
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:40,400
and when you see a package which is kind

152
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:43,130
of application data package is a package

153
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,589
containing encrypted data so for

154
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,589
instance if you see packages that go

155
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:52,850
from a high or too low port that would

156
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:57,140
be a HTTP requests and if from low to

157
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,850
high of this is a response package and

158
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,670
you can also see the size of it

159
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,160
science is important because size is

160
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,930
what has been used in crime as well as

161
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,930
another type of side channels

162
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,189
therefore which is our attack scenario

163
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,560
so in a couple of minutes I will tell

164
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,910
you what crime did and the attack is

165
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,768
scenario that I will describe later

166
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:30,990
robbery is not crime but it is very

167
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:34,320
similar so scenarios as follows victim

168
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,060
locks onto the website and then we are

169
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,820
in the situation where we can see the

170
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:43,349
traffic we can see the traffic can take

171
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:48,209
action over the traffic second action

172
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:50,579
over the traffic well I have promised

173
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,410
before when I said I am in the middle so

174
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:55,709
all the back panting think that you the

175
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,810
burp retard you did a certificate and to

176
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:00,599
prompt the TLS but I say in the middle

177
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:03,540
but you cannot really touched and TLS

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,190
well if the user accepts that the game

179
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,649
is over there is nothing else you can do

180
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,800
so we are saying that the user does not

181
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,139
accept it does not get any warning

182
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,709
there's nothing you are in the middle

183
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:20,490
even if you cannot really touch anything

184
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:25,018
which is layers above TLS you can also

185
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:29,790
you can touch whatever it's below the

186
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:32,100
layers below TLS so if you haven't used

187
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:37,430
crime before you haven't read about it

188
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,430
you can't do this because this is simple

189
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:47,750
but they used to compile or compress the

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,100
addresses and then to encrypt them so if

191
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,170
you are a real information

192
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:58,420
controlled by the attack you could start

193
00:10:51,170 --> 00:11:02,990
and play with this type of CP so if you

194
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:06,640
zip something the information existed

195
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,640
that with something size will be smaller

196
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:21,320
so do you see this is what I did until

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,320
the Kirtland gzip this is a simple

198
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:29,240
example w-c-c helps you count the number

199
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:33,390
of characters 310 bucks

200
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:36,780
and then when you start trying okay to

201
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:39,810
try a and that increases by 1 because

202
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,060
stream that I'm adding does not exist

203
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,989
anywhere the same goes with B when I

204
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,030
inserted C then it becomes a smaller

205
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,210
well such well what I'm writing which is

206
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:55,230
controlled by the attack attacker is

207
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:58,380
similar to the session cookie every time

208
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,390
I tested I get to see whether the

209
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,189
packages is modern and bigger so

210
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,949
therefore the attacker can see whether

211
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:08,000
he is getting it right with the cookie

212
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:12,390
data okay and then he just takes over

213
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,230
and that was crying that was not me okay

214
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:19,560
but still I couldn't help thinking about

215
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:22,170
crime when I was making the audit so

216
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,829
crime is used to that with the requests

217
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,229
and then the person data breach okay

218
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:32,480
that did exactly same things with the

219
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:38,340
response okay if not use the cookie but

220
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:42,030
uses RSS so I thought about crime

221
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:45,880
because I do something similar but with

222
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:48,730
the response package

223
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:55,600
so that came to mind can you remember

224
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:57,430
that form from Mike usage so it means

225
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,320
that if you look for something well if

226
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,449
you look for something that does not

227
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,490
exist okay so the answer will have a

228
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:07,240
number of parts but when you look for

229
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:10,150
something that does exist the response

230
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:14,170
will have a high number of bytes because

231
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:17,740
well results take up some space and then

232
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,719
when we so that when countries and I

233
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,660
said well I think that could be

234
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,870
expressed in the same manner the crime

235
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:31,780
and breach and I said okay I'm going to

236
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:37,870
test it I said okay if I try letter and

237
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:43,600
then I get 100 case back then I try G

238
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:46,600
get a hundred but back and then I try H

239
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,230
and I get two hundred canes back which

240
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,060
is the right letter this one it's an S

241
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,740
to come to that but monitoring the

242
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,089
traffic monitoring the size of the

243
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,090
packages coming and going

244
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:07,310
and as I said I was working on project

245
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,739
for one planet and you know that

246
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,869
pentesters when we have an art project

247
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:17,180
we are always short for time we are

248
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:20,450
always pressed for time so we are all

249
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,069
very much ashamed of the code that we

250
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,839
use when we are expertly something for

251
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,940
the first time but in this case as I am

252
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,470
going to discuss it I'm going to show it

253
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:34,010
I know that it is like in very paradigm

254
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:37,300
PHP access it is and then you had sleep

255
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,620
and I used to notice they came in with

256
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,279
images the first image to the sleep of

257
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,770
one second the second image did sleep of

258
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,110
two seconds and each of sleep tried a

259
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:51,910
different character and then the most

260
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:55,820
sniffer to identify whether the fifth

261
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:59,660
connection was the biggest therefore

262
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,700
that told me that that was the number 5

263
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:06,400
was the red lever while we showed that

264
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,400
to the client and the client accepted it

265
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:17,240
well then the project crossover came out

266
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:24,020
some fantastic before I've reported it

267
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:25,640
but I kind of I froze it so when I visit

268
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,980
a client when I working with the clients

269
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:31,580
and I find something which is special I

270
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:37,660
just kind of freeze it for a year or so

271
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,660
because I don't think it is fair to

272
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:44,870
publish it the next day okay something

273
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:48,109
if you don't publish his name as I say I

274
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,700
put it aside I feel bad for some time

275
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,670
and I said okay we'll come back to it

276
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,950
after some time okay and we'll talk

277
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:00,949
about it and then something happens

278
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:03,020
which was the following okay yeah later

279
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,510
this presentation was giving out the

280
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:09,280
black hats in the US and when I read it

281
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,280
I said oh

282
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:21,199
that was my funding so these men did

283
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,330
what I did but he did it with finding

284
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,760
that on the network he referred to it as

285
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,460
timing attack so when the website from

286
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,980
when he forced the browser to make

287
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,900
conditions he measured the time the

288
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,490
loading time which should be more or

289
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,819
less equivalent to the size of the

290
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,820
package

291
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,100
anyhow I looked for the tool that he'd

292
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,420
used but he hadn't published the tool

293
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,519
that he had used and this is after where

294
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:57,120
do you find for inside channel sometimes

295
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,100
the code is not published but he did so

296
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,130
I couldn't really find any tool that

297
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,319
will help me try this again in a

298
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:12,559
different way and therefore I decided

299
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:15,918
myself to be able to do and these two

300
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,918
was named

301
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:26,708
as follows oh sorry

302
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,709
also want to take a picture so too late

303
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:38,390
so I just wanted it to call it fiestas

304
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:42,080
and then I just found the words okay to

305
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:49,130
put it fiesta so easy

306
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:51,439
github it is written - I am a bit angry

307
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,520
and I think that I want to start

308
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,130
programming in girl

309
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:59,540
so probably we change it to girl alright

310
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:01,640
so these two ones very similar to crime

311
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,970
that is to say there are two parts to it

312
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:09,740
one part is kind of a web server is a

313
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:13,490
JavaScript actually could be injected in

314
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,770
any HTTP page which is not encrypted

315
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,860
you could insert it inside the user

316
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:21,260
would not have to visit any link he'll

317
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:24,770
open up any link just by browsing it

318
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,410
they will be injected and then the Java

319
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:31,670
scripts okay connects to the vulnerable

320
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:36,040
sites and then takes a look at the size

321
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,040
then the modules talk to each other

322
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,740
and then you can see which is the just

323
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,130
wait until you find the right character

324
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,130
okay

325
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:56,390
one of the things that I did was just to

326
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,670
include the possibility of hatching or

327
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:02,300
changing lots of parameters in the

328
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:07,250
config module and I said well let us try

329
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:11,000
to do something more generic so this is

330
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:13,400
what config feel file looks like so you

331
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,330
choose what you want the connection to

332
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:24,170
make the relay where is the injection

333
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:29,600
point and what you want to look for so

334
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:32,930
turn is a fixed term the chart set is

335
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,959
what it looks after the term okay looks

336
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:43,780
for after the term so handsome will be 0

337
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:43,780
1 2 3 4 5 6 now I show you a demo

338
00:19:52,190 --> 00:20:00,950
okay so this is the website that I

339
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:04,100
mentioned before so this is the page

340
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,160
that will load the JavaScript but we

341
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,439
could inject it when the user is

342
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,490
browsing so that people didn't notice

343
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:19,730
anything he wouldn't get to see any odd

344
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:22,510
side okay I'll show it to you and I

345
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,510
explained it

346
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:40,540
so you would start loading hopefully

347
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,050
will start loading however for a few

348
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,050
seconds

349
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:50,940
okay you see loads once twice

350
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,520
some reasoning is the same that I told

351
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,730
you for the strip PHP it opens up many

352
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:05,220
images okay each of the images sense

353
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:12,820
outside requests to the other sites okay

354
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:17,710
so it structs so if you notice the chart

355
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:21,010
set chart says will be for email when I

356
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,950
said the victim is the @ sign and then

357
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,600
these will track the letters on the

358
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,930
rights and then when they finish setup

359
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,340
go to the letters on the left okay and

360
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:34,840
when they finish this I say okay this is

361
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:41,129
the email address that I found okay

362
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:44,439
pretty at time zombie and this should be

363
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:46,690
around here okay pretty zombie this is

364
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,960
encrypted and he has taking it out from

365
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,960
here

366
00:21:53,050 --> 00:22:00,580
and they will continue checking out

367
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,680
everything up until it finishes and

368
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,780
besides okay it is over do leave it

369
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:10,840
there for sometime okay continues to

370
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:12,520
take things out so this may sounds a bit

371
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,679
we are I was hopeful that I would have

372
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,210
failed because I would tell you about

373
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:22,690
the reason for failure so let us try to

374
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:26,970
screw it a bit so that we can see when

375
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,970
it fails why it fails

376
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:38,650
okay as faithful ready well notice that

377
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:41,090
I'm making these monitors

378
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:44,180
monitoring is I'm taking a look at the

379
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:46,429
traffic but it will have the traffic of

380
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,460
JavaScript and deleted traffic of the

381
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:51,440
size may be the case that I don't know

382
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:55,220
what is happening so it has a heuristics

383
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,460
there that forces see if I tried out say

384
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,420
ten and then finds out fifteen

385
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,060
connections and say oh something has

386
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,050
come round and the stops okay wait for 5

387
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:09,620
seconds clean buffa and tries again

388
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:14,120
however it may also be the case that it

389
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:18,620
gets a wrong letter from character so

390
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:23,959
may repeat it again to make it sure but

391
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:28,550
it will just take longer time okay so

392
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:34,840
another one Safi at sign very

393
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:34,840
hotmail.com okay so this is the tool

394
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:58,280
and therefore what are the problems that

395
00:23:53,030 --> 00:24:01,420
I encountered I found that many of these

396
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:06,559
sites do not know data when you load the

397
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:10,580
main website but do it later it ok later

398
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,830
on and that request sometimes go through

399
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:18,350
a token so therefore you cannot call it

400
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:20,300
direct so if you take a look at the

401
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:26,990
config file of the tool you will see

402
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:29,120
lots of possibilities I said ok you can

403
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:34,030
go and say ok instead of checking the

404
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,899
main website take a look at the third

405
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,360
connection ok there are a number of

406
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,760
fields you can play around with you

407
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,919
cannot do it by loading an image but you

408
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,870
have to do it by loading an iframe

409
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:49,490
because you have to facilitate rendering

410
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,350
but you can do that in practice another

411
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:58,790
problem that I found is that many

412
00:24:51,350 --> 00:25:01,490
websites nowadays use HTTP to someone

413
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:06,020
you want to get to the third connection

414
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:09,020
you are in trouble you know HTTP to

415
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,970
works in a synchronous manner so it is

416
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:15,830
very difficult to see the response that

417
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:17,780
is matched to each to the request ok so

418
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:22,939
it sends out all the responses together

419
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:26,030
so loads HTML and HTTP to sense all the

420
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,330
connections or the images everything and

421
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,160
then they come back through the

422
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,639
application data which is encrypted that

423
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,179
it is marked with an ID I'm going to get

424
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,360
them back

425
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:40,010
maybe disarranged because I have a

426
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,129
problem because I don't know which

427
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:46,440
requests matches which response ok and

428
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:51,050
then I said ok careful careful ok

429
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,050
it's level okay first

430
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:00,029
basically that's the following for you

431
00:25:57,209 --> 00:26:02,039
because it is synchronous means that I

432
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:04,649
can sense out that request okay one

433
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,899
request and it stops stop the other two

434
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:08,998
because they are not synchronous because

435
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,799
I am in the middle so I sent her the

436
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:13,019
first request I stopped the other two

437
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:16,019
requests and I went for that request to

438
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:20,639
be finished then I move on to the next

439
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:23,279
one waits to have the response to it so

440
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:26,869
thoughtful well I prefer to this option

441
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:30,809
has multiplex so this is an example

442
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:37,109
about how festive works on the Left we

443
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:40,469
have HTTP point one it's not in force or

444
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:44,009
56 because browsers use more than one

445
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:47,399
thread to make the loading so it is db2

446
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:53,519
we see these noting in chunks okay and

447
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:57,119
then below will have HTTP 2 and Festa it

448
00:26:53,519 --> 00:27:00,329
does it one by one that's the image then

449
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:04,619
I wait for you to give me a response so

450
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:07,198
this is a good option to in HTTP 2 to

451
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:09,049
target the third connection the false

452
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:11,909
connection you name it

453
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:14,729
okay so when I had these when I say

454
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:16,379
wonderful okay then I will give a

455
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:18,659
presentation about site and they say I'm

456
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:21,178
not going to give a presentation and to

457
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:26,940
use the examples of the clients that I

458
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:30,539
audited said ok I'm going to use take

459
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:34,440
Alex and I'm going to start try to find

460
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:37,049
who's got it similar from today's it

461
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,289
took me some time okay and it was one of

462
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:42,289
the most disappointed disappointing

463
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:44,819
experiences in my life

464
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:47,209
because at the end of the day many of

465
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:49,619
these sites have lots of JavaScript

466
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:55,669
generated dynamically that changes the

467
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:57,620
size of it and even the ssl packages are

468
00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:02,120
randomized

469
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:03,830
and it is much more difficult and I

470
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:09,320
don't like to lose

471
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:10,449
oh sorry sorry I'm not being accurate

472
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,610
okay

473
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:15,610
actually yes there was one which I found

474
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:22,970
that did that that was haka one induced

475
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,710
cold Jason Durden brings takes data from

476
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,409
the bounty that you have sent out about

477
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,330
they come with no token so you can send

478
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:34,510
that request as such with that Jayma

479
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:38,330
scripts and then you look for names of

480
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:41,090
companies of words you can also look it

481
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,520
up in dictionary of under abilities you

482
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,279
can see whether the person has reported

483
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:54,830
ties to what company has that was

484
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:58,279
reported so this is this is one of the

485
00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:01,418
ones how could one this is one of the

486
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:05,720
ones that I tried okay so and the

487
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:10,250
address was this one on the screen but

488
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:15,110
as I said I don't like to lose and I say

489
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:17,750
no no no no no surely I want to work

490
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:20,270
with some of these ok you surely will be

491
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,250
successful and I say well other in the

492
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:28,639
size and it's try to look for other

493
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:33,799
things and then I got a bright idea and

494
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:37,510
I say ok it loads an image per entry but

495
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,510
a wonderful I'm going to test it

496
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:48,899
right we'll make requests that does not

497
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:52,649
exist and then I take my image okay I

498
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:55,530
make a request okay and then it loaded

499
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:59,520
two pictures my picture and another one

500
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:03,600
and the connections to bring photos back

501
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,280
we could see them on net and I say

502
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:12,840
wonderful I have an idea

503
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:19,830
now I know what I can do now notice the

504
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:23,040
hole so it is connecting to here so

505
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:29,280
actually images were loaded from a C and

506
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:31,670
D no noise each connection brush an

507
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,670
image

508
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,900
so the problem that I had with images is

509
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:43,479
that they go to gosh and I say yes I do

510
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:46,180
the first test and we'll get the first

511
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,790
letter for how do I get the second

512
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:56,050
letter because images are cached

513
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:58,420
yes images are cached if they reach the

514
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,139
browser if I set a request and then I

515
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,350
drop it

516
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:05,290
and the response never gets to the

517
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:07,889
browser it will never be cached the next

518
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:11,678
time they tried to load the image well

519
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:13,090
they would try to load it again

520
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,690
so the other difference is that the

521
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:19,090
browser uses it or tries it again but it

522
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:23,230
uses it only tries it only three times

523
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:25,449
so I say okay image will be well there

524
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:28,600
will be three loading attempts okay so

525
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:31,570
if I can see three loading at times it

526
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,459
means that I got it right and then

527
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,050
another thing that happened I said well

528
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,030
the first time that I know really if the

529
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:39,159
user is using it may have the images

530
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,700
cached and then I also noticed that

531
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,130
these companies have CD ends around the

532
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:49,900
world and they deliver the image from

533
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:52,660
the D and s which is closest to you for

534
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,270
instance if you are in Europe images are

535
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:59,440
loaded from a server which is located in

536
00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:05,379
Madrid but if you change the DNS

537
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:07,750
resolution and you send it out to SATA

538
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,100
in the US images are no different

539
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,710
somewhere else and they are not cached

540
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:16,629
so if you play around with these two

541
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:21,980
things you can make the browser loading

542
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:24,380
the images without caching them you know

543
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,440
and in this fashion we can set up the

544
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,760
configuration file we can do it this way

545
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:33,080
before it was images

546
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:35,210
I now have changed to open control to

547
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,120
open that opens a window I'll explain

548
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:40,340
that in a minute

549
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,080
I'm saying that the Oracle is the

550
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,928
connections before I said it was the

551
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,449
size the number of connections and the

552
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:49,100
action is drop before it was relay it

553
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,139
would allow connections to go through

554
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:54,709
now I drop the connection so I just

555
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:58,699
count them and the rest is basically the

556
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:02,480
same info fellas where's Polly girl gone

557
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,760
Nestor so I was this idea I went back to

558
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,909
Alexa I'll tell you what came out of

559
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,908
this

560
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:17,430
Gmail was not vulnerable but inbox was

561
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:22,140
in box basically loads the emails for

562
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:24,210
Gmail since inbox loads an image with

563
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,980
the avatar coming from the person that

564
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:31,050
sent you the email you do a search and

565
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:36,180
you can see little things here and there

566
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:37,919
the the stronger the more powerful the

567
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,010
browser is them the more the things you

568
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,680
can find here you have to search word by

569
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,180
word for example you wouldn't be able to

570
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,520
extract a token like this because it's a

571
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,950
full word but you could search for the

572
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,300
email address for that guy and then find

573
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,310
the inner dictionary the fact that

574
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,669
someone is talking to someone else about

575
00:33:53,310 --> 00:34:01,110
these things if this is details for a

576
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:03,030
credit card which go in blocks four

577
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,850
digit blocks you could see that someone

578
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,200
has sent the credit card detail that

579
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:14,330
credit card he does to someone else by

580
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,330
email there you go images Google Drive

581
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:24,639
same thing what Google Drive does is to

582
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:27,349
load a preview of the file that preview

583
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,730
well the connection is established if

584
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:33,800
the search finds the file where Google

585
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:40,070
Drive is similar you need to search my

586
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:43,210
words as an inbox but now this indexes

587
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:46,280
the contents of their files even PDFs

588
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:47,810
you sent a PDF with a credit card it's

589
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,609
in Google Drive with this you can

590
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:54,619
extract the information or even a dog

591
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:59,119
document with a password it will extract

592
00:34:54,619 --> 00:35:01,160
all the contents within the file in

593
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,140
Dropbox this was interesting because

594
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,990
don't have a preview of each file in

595
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,240
Dropbox but it doesn't make any

596
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:11,390
difference because it shows you an image

597
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,930
when you finds nothing so it's the other

598
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:16,910
way around I sent a request if I get an

599
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:21,069
image it means that I failed if it

600
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:23,779
doesn't load anything I've done it right

601
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:26,869
welcome a la una goes que el are sealed

602
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,609
so same as in Gmail in the free version

603
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:31,400
it has an index the contents you you

604
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:33,078
would need the pro version as in Google

605
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,210
if you want to do the same as in Google

606
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:40,400
Drive extracting the contents from those

607
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:44,359
files what else we have Facebook in

608
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:48,230
messenger in facebook Messenger is the

609
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:51,500
same story you have a search engine that

610
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,450
loads the images for those people whose

611
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,640
conversation fits the search that you

612
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:58,609
have carried out so you can search for

613
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,470
words you can search for topics I don't

614
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:03,859
know politics or a certain political

615
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:06,649
party you do a word list you cannot

616
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:09,140
search for character by character say

617
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:12,369
and you find out that someone is talking

618
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,368
to someone else about these topics

619
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:20,900
and let me now show you the one for

620
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,900
Google contacts

621
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,299
let's play some music

622
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,529
so that Ramon fights with the people

623
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,530
over at YouTube

624
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:50,169
oh no no that's the one Gragas el

625
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:53,348
telefono Abajo sorry buddy I think you

626
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:57,179
can see the phone number down then so

627
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:57,179
wait and see if it catches that

628
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:30,530
well the ladies Mako free records you

629
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,530
see that can you confirm it's the same

630
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:41,540
[Applause]

631
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:46,320
boy I know

632
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:52,350
voice cont'd Esther you do a bit so I

633
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:54,920
see all of this and I try and find out

634
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,920
other things

635
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,310
I thought of sending this to the

636
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:02,110
companies so that I could get fixed if

637
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,410
they give me money fine

638
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:08,710
but that was not my goal I felt

639
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:10,660
encouraged to tell these companies so my

640
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,460
experience with bug bounties it was the

641
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:17,049
first time ever that I actually sent

642
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:18,670
things to bug bounties I don't this idea

643
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:24,040
in my mind that these things work this

644
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:25,720
way you send something and whatever you

645
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,440
send is rubbish for them most of the

646
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,750
time then you have to make an effort to

647
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,490
put together a compelling argument it's

648
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,550
complicated because these companies get

649
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,350
a lot of rubbish they have people at

650
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,330
level one who are not the biggest

651
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:43,240
experts in cybersecurity that you could

652
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:45,069
find and some things we notice which

653
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,759
which are not as straightforward as what

654
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:54,040
I've just shown are discarded right away

655
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:58,450
so it took me a while let me tell you

656
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:01,320
the story google hasn't fixed it since

657
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:05,580
you've seen what you've seen you can do

658
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,580
they said they wouldn't fix it

659
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:14,950
they said that was a problem with my

660
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:17,020
browser if anyone understands and I'd

661
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,598
love an explanation for that they just

662
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,910
sent a reply saying oh that's a problem

663
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,349
with your browser send it to the back

664
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:27,759
Bunty for Chrome I didn't send anything

665
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:29,740
because it wasn't I mean this wasn't

666
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,420
about sending things to different people

667
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:34,660
so and send anything to anyone and

668
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,609
hacker one that was a funny thing they

669
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:41,259
said this is a doubly a duplicate from

670
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:43,359
two years ago remember that the one from

671
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:47,799
hacker one had no images it was the

672
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:51,339
first attack that we saw before so they

673
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:53,440
gave me a link to the ticket where

674
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:55,058
someone had already mentioned that since

675
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,510
you don't have a token through the image

676
00:40:55,059 --> 00:41:01,000
and they had told him well this is

677
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:03,520
complicated for some reason import

678
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,829
bounties when there is but when you find

679
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,990
the voice man in the middle well you're

680
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:13,779
almost rubbish by default they don't

681
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:16,089
seem to see any relevance in these

682
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:19,089
things so these two companies will not

683
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:24,609
fix it if they do fix it tell me because

684
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:29,308
I'll reel claim my reward who fixed it

685
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:29,308
Facebook did Dropbox fixed it as well

686
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,730
the first time I said did they said well

687
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,730
man in the middle

688
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:47,330
when they said no first time around so I

689
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:51,339
called Louise and I said Louise I think

690
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:54,410
this should be fixed seriously

691
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:58,010
so he said wait for me to get into my

692
00:41:54,410 --> 00:42:00,710
shift I'll take a look at the ticket so

693
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:02,120
a couple of days later he wrote to me

694
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,580
and said I've had a look

695
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,730
he said I've rewritten half of it he

696
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,650
said what a load of rubbish now he gave

697
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,800
me a really good explanation he said

698
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:17,690
you've focused on the side channel and

699
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:20,770
he was a first serie the this is a CSRF

700
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:24,500
I should and I'm exploiting it this way

701
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:26,690
well so I told he's okay I understand

702
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,840
your approach but anyway I knew Louise

703
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,530
so he included a couple of comments it

704
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,440
went through

705
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:38,870
they got the green light and they fixed

706
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:41,710
it and in Dropbox these are the ones

707
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,710
that responded

708
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,230
most quickly they actually request an

709
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,589
information they wanted additional

710
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,410
details I explained it to them they told

711
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,580
me it would take some time

712
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,859
they asked me are you going to be

713
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,480
something about this tell me about the

714
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:01,310
dates because we will have a plan in

715
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:05,190
place to fix it and then they fixed it

716
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:08,610
so Facebook and Dropbox are not

717
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:12,180
vulnerable anymore Google and hacker one

718
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:16,490
well they are in theory they won't be

719
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,490
fixing it based on what they told me

720
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,630
I was expecting everyone to fix it using

721
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,730
a token but Facebook there's something

722
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,300
else which is also a good solution

723
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:32,210
when you search when you do the search

724
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:33,830
if you're not already in the page me I

725
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:36,710
mean you go into strain to the search

726
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:39,160
that you see a pop-up window are you

727
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:42,320
sure all you want to do a search

728
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,060
well if you link connections the user

729
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:48,310
will have to accept all of them so I

730
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,310
cannot do that requests the way I wanted

731
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,480
so far so good

732
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,440
I'm impressive also some security we

733
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,080
have a number of recruitment processes

734
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,230
in place if anyone is interested in

735
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:11,509
sending us their CV you can use this

736
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:14,560
email address and that was it for me

737
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,560
thank you so much

738
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:27,089
we're selling waka técnico me I'm going

739
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,269
to use technical jargon but no the hell

740
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:33,630
this is amazing man have you thought

741
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:35,819
about using attacks with known text for

742
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,920
example sending emails to someone with a

743
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:40,650
certain subject with a certain extension

744
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,900
and the same you did with Facebook

745
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:46,650
how about locating the whole thread that

746
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:51,269
would describe the button I'm just I'm

747
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:53,849
just doing some brainstorming well as it

748
00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:57,689
happens with Facebook you can see the

749
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:58,799
images I don't see their content I mean

750
00:44:57,689 --> 00:45:00,899
that text box

751
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:05,969
I'm not intercepting it I'm just seeing

752
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:10,729
the images questions from the floor oh

753
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:10,729
by the way talk to for me I did I did

754
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,099
questions you're all stunned

755
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,529
nothing what size do you need for your

756
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:31,459
own images is it an arbitrary size I

757
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:38,040
don't care I drop it something like a

758
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:39,990
Lewis dot something calm as long as you

759
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,589
control the domain where you are getting

760
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,589
the request

761
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:52,390
it can be the minimum size as long as

762
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:58,990
you can do your count yeah and don't

763
00:45:52,390 --> 00:46:02,259
rely early on the images I quoted

764
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:05,770
resource load Bayside channel something

765
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:10,150
like that got hold of an image but you

766
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:11,770
can do it in in different ways give me a

767
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,380
little script and get the data from

768
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:17,500
somewhere so this has to do with the

769
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:20,680
behavior of the website I'm going to ask

770
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:23,200
you something a bit tricky do you want

771
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,149
to talk about this in Def Con and black

772
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,960
hats and so on can they show you a video

773
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:31,120
today thank you so much this is killer

774
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:37,470
stuff killer stuff man

775
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:37,470
