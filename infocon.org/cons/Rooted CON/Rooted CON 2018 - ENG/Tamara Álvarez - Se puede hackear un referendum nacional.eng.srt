1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,450
sorry about the raffle because uh I

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,940
don't run these things I wasn't informed

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,190
there were secret things around but

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,590
anyway the raffle for the drone from

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,299
checkpoint will take place at 1 p.m. at

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,770
1 p.m. we'll have a connection between

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,060
the two rooms the three rooms sorry it

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,039
will be a connection between the three

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:30,240
rooms so that whoever wins the raffle

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,640
knows immediately and then after lunch

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,589
we will have the raffle for the to

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,690
mobile phones if you see that I forget

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,280
about it

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:43,860
give me a reminder from bruticon we

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,210
always make an effort to clarify if you

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,280
want to be good professionals in

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,190
cybersecurity not everything is about

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,140
exploiting reversing about seeing code

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,349
and using the best programming language

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,039
in the world not everything is about

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,340
techie or geeky things okay remember you

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,750
need to be aware about legal things you

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,360
need to know about the consequences of

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,240
whatever you do for your own lives what

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,960
happens if you go beyond the red lines

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,250
okay so tomorrow I will tell you what a

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,179
few things quite a few interesting

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,000
things we had a chat about very

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,100
sophisticated concepts so tomorrow you

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
have a flow thank you so much can you

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,059
hear me okay let me juice myself but

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,689
first of all I would like to apologize

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,979
if anyone feels offended by my

34
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:36,869
presentation this is not what I mean to

35
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:43,070
do of course I'll be talking about

36
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,070
constitutional law why why well this is

37
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,420
quite a situation I'm an intern of the

38
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,490
University of Leon in northwestern Spain

39
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,619
in the area of constitutional law and

40
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,500
I'm also a lecturer at one of the

41
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:01,880
master's degrees in cybersecurity at the

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,920
computer engineering faculty there so

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,670
when I tell my students they keep asking

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,590
me questions about this by the way I'm

45
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:15,019
not a lawyer I have a degree in public

46
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,110
administration and I think I've come

47
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:22,239
here today to tell you about stereotypes

48
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:25,910
about women participating in this world

49
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,829
and then the fact that the cliche that

50
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,989
we are supposed to be computer engineers

51
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:32,540
well I'm not a computer engineer I'm not

52
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,579
a lawyer I am a woman and I'll be

53
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,560
talking about constitutional law without

54
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:39,739
being a legal expert okay

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,150
I'm very daring personally speaking and

56
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:43,430
professionally speaking so I'm here to

57
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,379
tell you about a number of things first

58
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,870
of all I've changed the title for the

59
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:53,030
presentation can a national kind of

60
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,010
constitutional referendum be hacked does

61
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,530
the new title okay

62
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:01,489
I'm not using the word national and

63
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:05,150
that's why I have changed the title how

64
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:12,709
you hack can constitutional referendum

65
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:15,859
will be hard by using I cities is there

66
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:18,709
a chance to do that right after talking

67
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:21,829
to many of you well you answered yes of

68
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:25,639
course you can do so if you have a city

69
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:31,099
in place you that referendum could be

70
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:36,900
hacked all right okay let us try to go

71
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:41,200
deeper into it somebody steam

72
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,880
structure of my presentation so first of

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,190
all I would like to start wrestling

74
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,740
introduction to tell me more about the

75
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,680
topic through the concept which is well

76
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,510
known to us which is democracy and I

77
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,350
would like to refer to it or to

78
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,269
extrapolate it to digital democracy

79
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:01,269
later on I will move on to talk about

80
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,459
practical questions surely you can help

81
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,819
me out in there because I'm not have a

82
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:09,340
good command about that but still I try

83
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:12,070
it and let's say I'm daring enough and

84
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,790
then second practical questions and

85
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:18,969
number of techniques to be used I just

86
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:22,000
wanted to differentiate direct hacking

87
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,580
through hacking volleying sisters

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,720
critical infrastructures ooh interwork

89
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,359
hacking through information delivered or

90
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,150
made available to citizens then in a

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,270
third place I will move on to talk about

92
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,969
theoretical questions relating to the

93
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,950
legal framework I'd like to clarify a

94
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,630
number of things that are being said and

95
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:51,280
we should not believe another things

96
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:58,870
that we should be aware of and last what

97
00:04:51,280 --> 00:05:02,200
to do in case of referendum and what the

98
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,390
Blazer should be cited as okay so we

99
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,800
starting off with an introduction in the

100
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:10,080
21st century when we talk about

101
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:16,169
democracy we try to see in trouble Perce

102
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,169
participative direct democracy

103
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,139
so this type of democracy seems to be

104
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:28,690
questioned by the citizens it is also

105
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:35,960
being accused of corruption and then

106
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:39,500
added to that we have the democracy

107
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:44,630
being harassed by hyper-connectivity

108
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:47,660
and by globalization still we people

109
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,759
want to be a field that we are main

110
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,280
actors in our communities in the world

111
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,340
regions in our countries takes us to

112
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,960
think that whether this model of the

113
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:08,900
most representative democracy and the

114
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:11,719
shift to sharing democracy is in number

115
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:15,489
of changes here that is to say the

116
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:19,909
relationship between democracy and

117
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:24,560
citizens so those of us supporting this

118
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:27,440
notion try to advocate to for the need

119
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,430
of introducing that notion through the

120
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,620
concepts of quality democracy is not

121
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,210
about some dissipating only but it is

122
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,419
about quality participation in democracy

123
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:45,469
so obviously if we are talking about

124
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:46,729
constitutional referendum yeah or if we

125
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:52,370
are talking about general

126
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:56,719
lessons we would say that through demo

127
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:58,669
this will help us deliver or communicate

128
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:00,590
information to citizens if we are

129
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:05,240
talking about cost issues some research

130
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:12,008
says that economic and some costs could

131
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,009
be reduced because the results will be

132
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:22,710
it's we make be faster and we will also

133
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:25,800
be able to bring this closer to people

134
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,950
with disabilities so in the case of

135
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,900
Spain how does it fit with the

136
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,909
Constitution but the feeling with the

137
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,659
Constitution could be advocated for

138
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,880
through better compliance of the number

139
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,620
of articles in our Constitution

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:46,980
especially article 9

141
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:50,420
article 23 and article 29 these are the

142
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,420
articles that

143
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,570
establish citizen participation in

144
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,600
publications well it seems that in the

145
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:05,300
face of that Democratic crisis we'll

146
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:09,919
have half the solutions cyber democracy

147
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:14,389
a series 1e democracy and some of the

148
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:19,039
concepts that are linked to citizenship

149
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:29,060
and democracy through a series and will

150
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:33,830
be opposing analogic democracy and well

151
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:36,169
if we have the solution when we using it

152
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:40,789
on a regular basis because we are not as

153
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:43,640
that bad a series but we know that this

154
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,760
type of technologies are being used in

155
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,640
other countries for instance in the u.s.

156
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,850
in several states there and as well as

157
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,520
another European Union countries but

158
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:59,839
this is not taking hold in Spain and me

159
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,630
as person oriented through the

160
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,640
Constitution's either to ask you do you

161
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,459
think that there is any article in the

162
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,449
Constitution that refers at a given

163
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:15,500
point in time to IT science reducing the

164
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:19,339
word IT science is included in the

165
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,130
Constitution is that mentioned in the

166
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:25,029
Constitution again I'm not this is not

167
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,029
an example

168
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,470
over there they say that Constitution

169
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:42,870
does not include the word IT science

170
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,360
well I have to answer that yes it

171
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:50,220
includes that word it talks about the

172
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,990
limitation of the use of IT science so

173
00:09:50,220 --> 00:10:00,899
it is article 18 point four that led to

174
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:04,170
the passing or enacting of further law

175
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,769
so to me that limit in terms of the use

176
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,920
of IT science and in terms of current

177
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:15,029
eing fundamental rights and general

178
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:18,000
interest but that were that that doesn't

179
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:19,439
seem to say much is saying and not it is

180
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,439
not something about regulating data

181
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:24,779
science but it is talking about

182
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:26,969
limitation of it well this could give us

183
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:33,449
food for thought it is true to say that

184
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:36,660
in Spain for minor questions these well

185
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:38,120
ITC's have been used for this but minor

186
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,620
questions such as for instance

187
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,870
participation in local communities

188
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:48,839
through web 3.0 facilitating

189
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:51,060
communication and information with the

190
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,019
citizens and we see public

191
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,599
administrations

192
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,029
we are also aware of some projects I'm

193
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,829
sure that some of you participated in

194
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:01,500
research of these kinds of research

195
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:05,630
about this topic and this type of AI

196
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:09,470
cities are being tested for this type of

197
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,470
participating processes

198
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,670
so some of the pioneers in this type of

199
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:21,229
regulation are passed country Catalonian

200
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:24,229
gallaecia Valencian community so

201
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,230
policymakers

202
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:31,410
so from the constitutional viewpoints so

203
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,939
if we look at the autonomous communities

204
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:41,488
that are supporting our cities this also

205
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:43,868
give us a clue hints about the

206
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:47,549
policymakers in those autonomous

207
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:53,259
communities so we as these type of

208
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:57,549
things are being tested in some bridges

209
00:11:53,259 --> 00:12:02,859
in Spain and primarily a local level

210
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:05,350
however implementation of a series for

211
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:07,029
more serious processes for major

212
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,749
processes such as constitutional

213
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:13,540
referendum or even general election

214
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:18,489
seems that they are not just a

215
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:20,079
possibility and not yet feasible and I'm

216
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:21,879
sure you will have questions about that

217
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,099
when I talk about a constitutional

218
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:26,739
referendum I'm talking about those

219
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,449
referendums arising from article 23

220
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:34,660
point 1 of the Constitution and

221
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:39,279
primarily from 92 167 and 168 in the

222
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:43,719
third section and article 152 of the

223
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:47,319
articles of the bylaws of the autonomous

224
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,480
communities would like to say that we

225
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:54,419
are seeing an increasing interest in

226
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,419
country not because of the actual

227
00:12:54,449 --> 00:13:01,290
process but because of the polling

228
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:01,290
stations

229
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:12,510
so hunter in this question and the

230
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:16,260
reason why I cities are not being used

231
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:20,270
for this type of mod for constitutional

232
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,270
referendum is explained as follows

233
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:32,339
well security of cyber security is

234
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:36,199
referred to as the main reason for not

235
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:38,760
using I CDs in constitutional referendum

236
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,820
in this case when we are talking about

237
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,819
security and we end up talking about

238
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,310
cyber security we could look at it from

239
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,750
two different viewpoints on the one hand

240
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:53,750
practical viewpoints and since then

241
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,029
theoretical viewpoint both of them

242
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:05,490
converging in a single interest that is

243
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:07,850
to say ensuring the known and decided

244
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:13,050
participation or interference in a

245
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:19,079
constitutional process so using

246
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:22,170
electronic means and the level of trust

247
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,969
that the citizens should have in them to

248
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,870
my viewpoints should answer two

249
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:30,029
questions

250
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:35,940
good lectures who have referendum end up

251
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:39,390
being hacked could you influence these

252
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,760
processes through AI CDs we are not

253
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,350
talking about hacking only I don't know

254
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,360
whether this is the right terminology

255
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:51,600
anyway and to answer those questions I

256
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:55,680
looked looked it up in the literature

257
00:14:51,600 --> 00:15:00,329
and I focused on now I'd like to focus

258
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,388
on Gilbert frisk voting six ways of

259
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:05,269
hacking elections

260
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:08,529
he's referring to US elections and then

261
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:12,739
there is a paper written by d-rose

262
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:19,910
promise title is detoxing or the new

263
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:21,799
danger threatening democracy so we can

264
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:25,368
discuss this further at the question and

265
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:28,069
answer session and the question is which

266
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:30,910
one could be applied to the Spanish case

267
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:33,920
in case there will be an ICT referendum

268
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,319
one of the possibilities that come to

269
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,019
mind when it comes to template the

270
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,479
results of an election is related to the

271
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:45,499
information which is made available to

272
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:49,579
citizens yesterday we had a very

273
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:50,779
productive afternoon on this point so

274
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:55,638
the information that is made available

275
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:59,360
to citizens is intended as gaining or

276
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:03,410
achieving votes because public opinion

277
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,739
is being built up so building up on that

278
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:12,429
public opinion is linked to some high

279
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:17,679
city practices so for instance mailing

280
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:21,169
websites were hacking of social networks

281
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,579
Goods of hacking but broadly if you

282
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:25,749
watch ask me technical questions about

283
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:28,719
that I would not be able to answer and

284
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:31,759
some offerors also analyze the

285
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:37,589
possibility of creating groups of cyber

286
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:41,040
voluntaries whose aim is to build

287
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,040
public opinion

288
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,850
and then together we'll start

289
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:56,269
also

290
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:59,689
number of techniques also leading public

291
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:05,779
opinion and on this point social

292
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:07,970
networks as became became one of the

293
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:13,509
best tools to make information available

294
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:16,909
to citizens as well as fake information

295
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:19,579
fake news and fake information has also

296
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:21,339
been a topic of discussion discomforts

297
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:24,559
what happens here

298
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:28,128
well the world where I come from is

299
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:33,039
trying to put its hands on it and we

300
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:33,039
have to be well aware of face fake news

301
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:43,429
being debated widely in the legal field

302
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:46,549
or by legal experts and at the ends of

303
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:49,879
the day they are trying to confront some

304
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:52,759
constitutional principles some of which

305
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:57,039
are freedom of expression try to

306
00:17:52,759 --> 00:18:01,690
information established under Article 20

307
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:05,600
under the excuse of security of

308
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,279
delivering security so these that I'm

309
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,199
mentioning is not far away from as a

310
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:14,809
role well if some years time effect news

311
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,360
will be regulated and actually the

312
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:22,450
government's of Mac home in France is

313
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:25,820
proposing a draft though to regulate

314
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:28,490
thickness so I'm not going to go into

315
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:33,320
technicalities but anyway this sounds

316
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,659
threatening or frightening to me if this

317
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,769
is brought to Spain if that is to happen

318
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:41,600
in Spain we should be very careful at

319
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:44,809
this type of things because we are

320
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,250
giving very powerful tools to people who

321
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:50,059
may

322
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:53,960
use them and make those tools have a

323
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:57,320
significant impact on us so building of

324
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,990
public opinion media are the fourth

325
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,259
power they continue to be the fourth

326
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,259
power

327
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:10,490
take create public opinion and they also

328
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:12,860
created scandals so we had that

329
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:18,429
yesterday at a given point in time well

330
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:22,189
we always have legal and ethical

331
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:29,389
journalists however there is some type

332
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:34,029
of journalism that supports economic

333
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:36,168
interest is driven by economic interests

334
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:39,169
we had that yesterday

335
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:41,600
well we should also not forget about

336
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:45,190
taxing and other ways of gathering

337
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,529
information getting information about

338
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:51,200
the political candidates

339
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:54,250
those taking part in political campaigns

340
00:19:51,200 --> 00:20:01,159
those taking part in political rallies

341
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:06,340
etc this point the usual practice will

342
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:06,340
be as following putting that information

343
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:16,350
or making it available to the public at

344
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:19,230
the time we're most but at the time

345
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:21,750
close to the election date and that's

346
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,790
when this type of information about the

347
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:27,240
political candidate has the highest

348
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:30,720
impact we should not forget either about

349
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,150
the security of the people taking part

350
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,210
in these political campaigns because

351
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:40,500
sometimes not even the minimum standards

352
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,940
of cyber security are applied some for

353
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,810
instance that would be my case I'm a

354
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:50,820
very easy to hard to hug person and then

355
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:52,530
and what about well personal details are

356
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,149
important but sometimes we are talking

357
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:59,310
about institutional details

358
00:20:54,150 --> 00:21:01,290
institutional intelligence etc we will

359
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:04,070
look at that in the second part of my

360
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,070
presentation

361
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:16,459
through the second group of factions in

362
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:20,990
this case I'm not going to discover new

363
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:25,880
feel new here will be the idea would be

364
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:29,060
to dis enable the websites of the

365
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:32,720
opposing parties also getting

366
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:35,780
information about the electorate or the

367
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,500
members of specific political parties

368
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:42,250
were also to get information about the

369
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:49,210
funding of those political campaigns

370
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:49,210
also websites or service

371
00:21:53,660 --> 00:22:02,420
playing an important role in the

372
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:05,720
elections would be could be highly

373
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,330
damaged could be highly impacted let us

374
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,110
think about the situational websites and

375
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,110
also

376
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,830
printing places

377
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,879
so as I say I'm daring and talking about

378
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:28,659
constitutional issues in these

379
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:32,650
cybersecurity of IT security firm so I

380
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:36,760
asked you to apologize me before hands

381
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:40,450
so hacking could be listed or releases

382
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:44,220
they said hacking is hacking that law

383
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,220
enforcement agencies make

384
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,380
and a clear example of that is the badly

385
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:02,150
coined

386
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:05,390
Catalonian referendum so the court

387
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:08,660
number thirteen of catalonia that dis

388
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:10,520
enabled the websites encouraging

389
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,990
participation in the first of october

390
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:18,560
referendum by fulfilling judgments of

391
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:23,150
the constitutional court there according

392
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:27,500
to the judgments 114 2017 declared this

393
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:31,280
consultation illegal so the idea

394
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:36,290
the underlying idea behind this

395
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:38,840
reflection is the following action could

396
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:42,139
be taken in this case

397
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,139
[Music]

398
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:52,490
regarding servers and others as long as

399
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:57,870
the general interest of the nation is

400
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:03,509
being impacted or where serious damage

401
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:08,850
is being made on fundamental rights and

402
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:13,019
always always we intervention of law

403
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:18,320
enforcement and security agencies so

404
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:21,659
this idea is not unconstitutional

405
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,019
actually it is very much in line with

406
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:27,119
the Constitution and law the number of

407
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:31,129
technologies the wide range of

408
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:36,949
technologies available to us make us

409
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:36,949
allow us to talk about ICT referenda

410
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:45,320
and his skills that is often used from

411
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:50,710
notes implementing this type of rise Tec

412
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:54,770
referendum are just lack of security

413
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:58,250
well surely some of those high CDs will

414
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,990
be more likely to be hacked because they

415
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,880
are connected to the network but you may

416
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,370
concept that other side cities may not

417
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:11,179
be connected to the network well in that

418
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:13,549
case then those could claim that those I

419
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:17,110
CDs could be hacked the moment they are

420
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:17,110
installed or set up

421
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:27,110
where are the time office scrutiny an

422
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,570
example the threat of anonymous to the

423
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:33,679
Catalonian elections on the 21st of

424
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,980
december so we are being threatened for

425
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,980
sure

426
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:42,250
as enough threatens us but we are being

427
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,250
threatened

428
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:54,549
what I'm going to say is debatable so I

429
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:58,969
is strong defender of this type of ICD

430
00:25:54,549 --> 00:26:05,710
referenda however my premises has

431
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:09,470
following so after the election auditing

432
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:12,770
should be carried out so therefore I'm

433
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:15,710
talking about paper traceability paper

434
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:19,690
tracking that is to change that is to

435
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:23,539
say check who evidence of the vote that

436
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:27,049
she'll follow the election process that

437
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:33,879
will help either confirm the results of

438
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:33,879
the referendum or the election or to

439
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,340
change it are corrected in case of any

440
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:45,440
failure this is known as mercury process

441
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:53,870
this is nothing new in the case of

442
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:59,270
Germany in 2009 led to declare that one

443
00:26:53,870 --> 00:27:01,610
of the electoral processes was declared

444
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:05,929
unconstitutional because the rights of

445
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:09,799
advertising had not been respected if

446
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:11,390
one of the ultra cited for you if one if

447
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:15,730
the result has been change has been

448
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:19,490
modified therefore we the clarity with

449
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:22,159
said that we say that it went against

450
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,450
the principle of advertising but if you

451
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,460
come and say what if it is an

452
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:30,740
open-source software then the court says

453
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,809
but we are not an expert on that well

454
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,850
but then some of you talked about

455
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:37,399
blockchain technology I don't know what

456
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,770
blockchain is but that is showing

457
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:41,959
everywhere blockchain for everyone what

458
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,929
happens with blockchain technology I

459
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,970
asked my students to tell me more about

460
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:50,390
it

461
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:53,600
lock change could help us check the

462
00:27:50,390 --> 00:28:01,400
votes that we cast conduction will help

463
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:03,469
us to check that real time however there

464
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,270
are those who say that blockchain could

465
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:10,010
not be used because it goes against

466
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:11,570
Allah electoral regulations there

467
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:15,679
another practical question would be

468
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:20,139
about hacking or possible hacking of a

469
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,140
critical infrastructure of the country

470
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,440
we know that this is difficult but we

471
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:29,270
also know that it happens we just cannot

472
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,159
look to the other side we have to be

473
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:37,429
well aware of the dangers of the threat

474
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:41,169
and what they entail here I would like

475
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:45,350
to refer to the ubiquitous theory from

476
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:49,130
article 23 point 1 that says that if the

477
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:55,760
threat comes from any country we have

478
00:28:49,130 --> 00:29:02,320
the we are we are allowed to prosecute

479
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,320
this person under our Criminal Code

480
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:13,130
on this point

481
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:16,610
I'd like to put forward another question

482
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,380
let us not leave anything up to the

483
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,189
interpretation of the course

484
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:25,340
let us clearly established that

485
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:26,480
electoral processes are critical

486
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:35,209
infrastructure

487
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:40,750
let us regulator under No 2008 - 11 but

488
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:43,610
that should be clearly regulated

489
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,180
established in the law

490
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,179
so therefore

491
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,030
your reticle questions you have but now

492
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:59,040
let us move on to talk about theoretical

493
00:29:54,030 --> 00:30:00,990
questions complexity if a parent tells

494
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,030
you well if you are going to do this

495
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,910
this will be your criminal

496
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:08,129
accountability do not believe it okay

497
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,500
change lawyers find a different lawyer

498
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:12,780
because this is impossible

499
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,700
before I prepare this presentation and

500
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:18,060
because I'm interested in this topic I

501
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,600
met with criminal experts and it's all

502
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:23,070
they wealth

503
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,780
give me a structure find it make a table

504
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:27,179
for me and I said no no no this is just

505
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:30,629
impossible if someone tells you you can

506
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:36,300
go up to here you can make it up to here

507
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:40,560
no no no so there may be changes in the

508
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:45,570
criminal code then you will end up in

509
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:49,050
prison careful with what you do when to

510
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:54,389
stop ok I like challenges still and

511
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:57,440
often when you talk to people in the

512
00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:01,650
field of cybersecurity tells you about

513
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:06,330
criminal or IT crimes those related to

514
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:10,010
article 198 now actually the article

515
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:15,210
that is applied in this case is article

516
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:19,980
264 on section 2 4 and it talks about a

517
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:24,030
type of crime as long as it is proven

518
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:26,820
that the security of the nation has been

519
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:31,399
threatened has been jeopardized you may

520
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,399
be held accountable for it

521
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,719
and

522
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,439
if you

523
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:57,379
if you drop on this type of systems you

524
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:59,470
will be sentenced to prison so when we

525
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:06,740
are talking about intellect hacking

526
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:09,650
article 197 is applied which is lighter

527
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:13,160
than the previous one and before I move

528
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:17,179
on to electron crimes another question

529
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:21,830
comes up that is to say they need to

530
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:24,049
associate an action to the perpetrator

531
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,870
of an action the practice may be

532
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:30,230
included in the criminal code however if

533
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:32,418
it is not proven cannot be proven the

534
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:35,470
perpetrator of deduction we are not

535
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:35,470
talking about accountability

536
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,309
another debates

537
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:55,560
open today's it's the following if you

538
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,720
are soaking electricity referendum which

539
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,120
does not exist but let us assume that it

540
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,770
exists

541
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:06,510
could it be applied to electoral crimes

542
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:11,220
so here says this is not applied to

543
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:16,710
electric trams because to cannot apply

544
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:19,920
it because these electoral crimes are

545
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:24,680
included under the general can ignore

546
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:27,030
this says no this cannot be applied okay

547
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:31,290
so this is not applicable

548
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:33,270
beware of the interpretation I would say

549
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:35,550
that this can be applicable in fact they

550
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:39,270
should be applied to this type of

551
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:45,540
electoral crimes we can have general

552
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:48,300
elections so we can have referendums the

553
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:52,440
special law takes us to this regulation

554
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:56,520
in fact I'm very critical of these

555
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,240
things this is another regulation that

556
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:02,790
should be amended because it is not

557
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:05,180
responding suitably to the reality

558
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:09,000
around us I mean this was drafted in

559
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,650
1985 a long time ago and things have

560
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,340
changed quite a lot let us assume that

561
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:16,260
we are facing now general elections to

562
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:20,810
give you an example took a look at

563
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,810
article 140 4.1

564
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,760
this is the penalty that would be

565
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:32,270
imposed to anyone carrying out

566
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,300
propaganda actions once the deadline has

567
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,889
been met for the electoral campaign let

568
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:43,310
me give you examples Mariano Rajoy

569
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:46,460
publishes a tweet and says vote for me

570
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:52,299
because my party is the best would that

571
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:56,990
be part of what article 1 44.1

572
00:34:52,300 --> 00:35:00,410
establishes it would now if this is

573
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:03,290
retweeted wouldn't it be part of one

574
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:13,700
44.1 well that would be that would have

575
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:17,390
to be interpreted one four six talks

576
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:21,649
about obstacles to electoral campaign so

577
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:25,490
two elections if an electronic balloting

578
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:30,380
system is hijacked or hacked could that

579
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:33,140
be considered a crime there is there can

580
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:36,970
be added to the previous one in order to

581
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:41,240
calculate the total punishment from that

582
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,950
wall Eve he certainly could and then

583
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,700
video conferences if the video

584
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:49,730
conference itself is hacked with this

585
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,410
article be applicable but there's

586
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:56,560
there's lots of things I'm left with a

587
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:56,560
minutes more or less one more question

588
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,899
if we are considering in a remote

589
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,120
electronic balloting system we should

590
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,820
pay attention to special law number two

591
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:12,140
of nineteen eighty approved on the 18th

592
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:17,190
of January a law that regulates the

593
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:20,430
different types of referendum that could

594
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:25,200
be organised in Spain article 16 point 1

595
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:27,690
refers to the voting process through

596
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,470
special ballot papers and envelopes that

597
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:34,290
should be subject to a certain size and

598
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:38,580
that would be printed including the text

599
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:41,700
for the referendum article 11 is subject

600
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:44,930
to the terms and conditions established

601
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:53,100
by the special law number 5 approved in

602
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:55,169
1985 for the general electro regime so

603
00:36:53,100 --> 00:37:00,110
two questions the difficulties we are

604
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:00,110
facing when amending

605
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:08,849
regulations we need to join efforts does

606
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:12,299
the only way forward in my opinion

607
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:17,819
that's the only way to use technology in

608
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:22,890
an appropriate manner so going back to

609
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:25,710
the title can we hack elections of

610
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:33,529
course can we hang collections that is

611
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:33,529
the main motive why in Spain

612
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:43,589
why in Spain not enough projects have

613
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:47,999
been carried out about these these

614
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:49,470
matters that's why I say that in certain

615
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:52,759
member states of the European Union

616
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:55,529
they're in fact taking a step backwards

617
00:37:52,759 --> 00:38:02,279
when talking about vulnerabilities I've

618
00:37:55,529 --> 00:38:05,339
seen cases in Holland although the

619
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:09,390
European Parliament is pushing for newer

620
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:12,328
initiative or new initiatives and now

621
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,920
some food for thought there is a real

622
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:16,109
possibility that people could have a

623
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,369
referendum so we need to have

624
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:19,369
appropriate responses in place

625
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:28,490
before anything happens with prevention

626
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,680
during the incident with defense and

627
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:34,339
with responsibility after the event has

628
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,319
taken the incidents has taken place that

629
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:41,420
could be my final conclusion otherwise

630
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:44,359
Rahman will kill me very very grateful

631
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:47,900
for your presence thank you so much for

632
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:49,819
attending my presentation I'll be more

633
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:55,190
than happy to answer any questions you

634
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:57,320
may have thank you so much Moochie

635
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:01,010
simulcast America say Pascal thank you

636
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:04,099
so much tomorrow they're seeing you from

637
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:07,310
all rooms at the same time okay one

638
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:12,520
question only one question please we're

639
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:17,390
not doing well with time I'm sorry I

640
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,890
have a very quick question myself and

641
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,868
I'd love you to answer that question

642
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,720
thinking about the audience as quickly

643
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:25,580
as possible please otherwise we will

644
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:31,339
have an excuse to invite you to come

645
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:35,450
nasha where do you think we should draw

646
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:38,180
the red line for for current states are

647
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:40,368
we in a world where states should no

648
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,990
longer exist as they were conceived in

649
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:43,040
the past

650
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:47,649
that's quite a philosophical question

651
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,650
I'm very pessimistic I have to say

652
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:58,700
the offline state the analog state as we

653
00:39:51,710 --> 00:40:01,730
knew it is following a track towards

654
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,740
personal vanity if you like because

655
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,950
sovereignty is getting diluted into many

656
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:11,379
perspectives but then in their world in

657
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:14,868
the cyber world we are doing our best to

658
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:18,790
formulate the modern state in the worst

659
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:22,010
possible direction control coercion

660
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:23,660
limitation of public freedom and I think

661
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,530
in that sense we really need to think

662
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,500
carefully

663
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:29,839
we need citizens to be proactive with

664
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,690
citizens to tell the authorities their

665
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,210
institutions their states the

666
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:38,440
international institutions their states

667
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:41,720
belong to citizens must stand up and say

668
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,280
this is not only about restriction we

669
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,980
