1
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:44,010
Yury Luzhkov is me please

2
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,820
bueno en vivo esta Charla soloist Oh yo

3
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,809
a kiss noise infinera una persona

4
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:56,190
yeah vosotros junto actresses de como

5
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,989
hacer so you know it's a una reflections

6
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,649
to sobre como estamos haciendo el

7
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,078
software

8
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:10,170
como esta tarde el sitio nvidia software

9
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:23,360
y que tiene primero en pasar por lo que

10
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:26,340
mas me proposed resulta conformity a day

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:32,280
he doshas algunos problemas de saguni

12
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:38,070
ecology dos mac fixes me parece natori

13
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:40,829
Oh porque estamos en dia Horan's over

14
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,750
where Thomas nothing near Mucha Logica

15
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:48,779
case my idea de da de las discrimination

16
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,860
is convicted a Neftali - estuvieron

17
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,860
Solomon Torre and others

18
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,919
conversions before we are different

19
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:06,399
versions we have six point zero six one

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,520
three five point two but right now we

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,690
have a trending programs it softer to

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,620
have a major or a minor revision

23
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,829
different versions and lots of

24
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:23,350
information and it seems that people are

25
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:25,480
just working without a real structure

26
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,480
another thing that we need to remember

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,480
is the security awareness racing is

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,160
growing a lot on the other hand we see

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,609
that a number of patches and updates is

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,100
also growing and this brought to mind a

31
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:43,750
series of questions this is really

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,940
positive people parching because they

33
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,450
found vulnerabilities and are they

34
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,720
applying the knowledge to detect them

35
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:59,399
quickly or is is because we're being

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,400
less careful in programming okay so

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,870
one of the things I thought would be

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,200
convenient was to look at the number of

39
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:10,170
vulnerabilities we have country so you

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,510
come to 2017 and you find an interesting

41
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,339
piece of information fourteen thousand

42
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,799
seven hundred and nine vulnerabilities

43
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,170
having different detective easier so far

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,510
what does that mean it means that in

45
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,950
2017

46
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,019
it's been the year where most vulnerable

47
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,500
T's has being have been detected in

48
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,920
comparison to the inverse of the years

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,650
it gobbles up the figure of 2016 and

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,099
this could be some interesting food for

51
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,549
thought

52
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:41,160
so you may think that techniques have

53
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,380
improved the people are beginning to

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,060
apply the doggy's when it comes to tech

55
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:51,599
things and that's where we find many

56
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,690
those techniques are showing some small

57
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,859
flaws realized about earlier and people

58
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,799
are working on that now the Visia if we

59
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,730
look at how we're out in 2018 we're

60
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,130
gonna follow the same trend in two

61
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:12,660
months in a sex part of a year we have

62
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:16,858
found 2605 vulnerabilities as more than

63
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,260
five fifteen hundred six fifteen

64
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:22,400
thousand sixteen six hundred all

65
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,400
together here and

66
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,970
I'm a certain type of category within

67
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,280
programming of the area realize that is

68
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,080
quite well distributed we'll have a

69
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,770
faithful applications while the fail

70
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,260
operation systems mobile devices are not

71
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,549
lagging behind and what is important bit

72
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,550
here we need to think that

73
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,800
would you have uh software than you

74
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,860
developing you're gonna use an operating

75
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,200
system set of libraries that you can

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,880
apply in your software and you and will

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,650
probably also have vulnerabilities and

78
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,760
this is this yet another stage in

79
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,900
development of the technical abilities

80
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:10,620
so did you get to look at a set of

81
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:13,080
programs are you using and maybe up

82
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,600
Gracie I have a problem or am getting

83
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,270
the numbers wrong and achieving the

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,950
wrong conclusions but when I go into

85
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,690
them the far B's kind of headlines I

86
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,180
start researching and you see that

87
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,770
people are alarmed by these figures and

88
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:32,190
I think that piece should be concerning

89
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:34,760
for all of us so with this idea this

90
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:39,230
concern in mind let's do some analysis

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,230
I'm gonna focus is analysis first

92
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:47,060
on how developers and companies are

93
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,570
looking at security first of all who

94
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,450
realizes our axis of confidence even

95
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,280
though there is lots of training and

96
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:59,510
we're trying to raise a word ask on

97
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:04,130
security of years people are silly

98
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:09,099
spicing and so to say and rejecting the

99
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,100
problem for the wrong software

100
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:16,099
so you go and say well these problems

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,170
affect me these are all software such as

102
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,510
Skype or Windows but whose and look at

103
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,540
my software so what does this break this

104
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:27,110
brings about a lack of training there

105
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,890
are companies are not aware and they do

106
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:34,220
not give the developers the needed

107
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,740
skills to develop secure software so

108
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,660
what happens with it is they develop

109
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:43,310
proven they read an article there to

110
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,480
applaud they go to a website for more

111
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,310
secure development and a lot of

112
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,100
imitation they find that they need to

113
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,640
work a lot and that is difficult to

114
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,470
carry out that work most people laze

115
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,919
around they don't look at these concepts

116
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:02,740
and vision rays that you may have no

117
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:05,660
abilities in logging in the Access

118
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,930
database access in input validations

119
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,930
alone

120
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,029
and these questions is something we

121
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:18,619
should think about have you ever heard

122
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:21,779
them aha very often and I may have

123
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:24,149
committed leasing of thinking of them

124
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:25,379
sometimes not just these questions and

125
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:28,020
these way of thinking but whenever you

126
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:31,499
find someone who does pen testing and

127
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,169
not it and who works on all of this you

128
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:36,059
find that well I got the software of a

129
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:38,549
friend that they're developing his

130
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:41,550
company and since I know they will have

131
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:47,490
abilities I won't shackled up and

132
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:49,949
they're amazed so if we take as a basis

133
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,689
that the software may have run abilities

134
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,769
and the people not corrupting them maybe

135
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:57,659
you delete something wrong another way

136
00:07:55,769 --> 00:08:02,129
you've seen this is on the actual

137
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:04,379
development so we have cycle when it

138
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:07,559
comes to develop a software we different

139
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,719
societies where security is extremely

140
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:12,979
important and you need to start

141
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,979
designing analysis

142
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,750
I do apologize I kind of lost my slide

143
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,120
okay

144
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,289
so as I was saying and I do apologize

145
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,630
for the interruption in each stage of

146
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:44,490
the development of the software you need

147
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,720
to apply a set of methodologies to use

148
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:51,300
secure and psychosocial you need to

149
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,300
apply these and we begin

150
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:12,110
and we cover you for implementation any

151
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,290
such analysis of the code and afterwards

152
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,570
in the tests the assess our product we

153
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,849
apply simple my nama Canales is

154
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,680
penetration testing used to look at how

155
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:26,570
that software is made and you actually

156
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,449
get a product so was a problem here the

157
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,190
problem is that these brings about the

158
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,290
highest real did costs when it comes to

159
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,430
general right in it in its invest a

160
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,279
bigger amount of resources that you

161
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:43,370
thought of and then you have for

162
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:46,579
development for the long time you cannot

163
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:50,329
tell a customer are you gonna integrate

164
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:52,040
it in a month or a week there need an

165
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:55,099
assessment tend to calibrate at those

166
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,519
times on the other hand what do we get

167
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,850
well we get a low error rate or low

168
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,970
frame rate a more simple code they're

169
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:09,250
reviewed and easy maintenance this will

170
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,250
be a model applied to security

171
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,850
so how do you companies receive it they

172
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,680
have the kickoff meeting they have the

173
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,550
product they want to offer at the end of

174
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,949
the project and everyone is happy and we

175
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:28,569
have eating a perfect soft recycle the

176
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,920
problem is our asset quality

177
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,570
contribution we're trying to reuse the

178
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,599
delivery time to the customer so they

179
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:59,480
have these good service and we make the

180
00:10:35,600 --> 00:11:03,160
right money and here's a question you

181
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,160
have sitting gap so you need to cover

182
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,880
and you need to do full testing and when

183
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,160
you have the product you have an

184
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:20,689
uncontrolled estate the million right

185
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:22,610
many mistakes afterwards the one hand is

186
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:28,160
moving good for the company less costs

187
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:33,140
last time I turn around all this giving

188
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,949
us I was writing a sable curve that is

189
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,949
not all tested

190
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,059
and the question here is does this

191
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,619
really bring true benefits for the

192
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:47,618
company is this what the company wants

193
00:11:50,940 --> 00:12:00,030
so the first come this benefit is how do

194
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,430
you happen suppose you have it you fix

195
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,350
him on the market to prefer to fix the

196
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,739
problem in maintenance eventually

197
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:11,760
generates a cost on the actual product

198
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:16,020
and the real benefit terms of product

199
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:20,670
you may see turns well if I program for

200
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:23,130
how they've months and I give a say

201
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:26,790
without to the product for a certain

202
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:30,060
period I'll run out of money so if I

203
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,670
exploited our paying for months if I

204
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,050
should conduct for months so we need to

205
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,640
look at whether that's beneficial

206
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,079
without in the civilization of the

207
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:43,010
actual product and the effort invested

208
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,010
in these terms

209
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,339
needs to be understood Eve actually the

210
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,339
main team is a stage

211
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,069
in that stage is harder to fix bones and

212
00:12:51,910 --> 00:13:12,579
the early stages of the software they

213
00:12:54,069 --> 00:13:14,319
see I did need to go back such as having

214
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:16,449
the resources invested in another

215
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:19,269
project and we need to move that again

216
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:21,819
and if that project s also loses trust

217
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:25,120
of the customer because if they fail

218
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:28,420
rate increases the Kozma would be

219
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,459
reluctant to use our product and let me

220
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,790
know now koala value and then the

221
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:41,670
pressure when you have a project and you

222
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:41,670
have other objectives project and right

223
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:53,930
so how can we approach these set of

224
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,529
things well we're not trying to explain

225
00:13:53,930 --> 00:14:02,199
that in three concepts we all need to

226
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:05,810
account first of all is integration into

227
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,880
development is essential and I think

228
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:10,729
that people should make an effort in

229
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,540
applying those methodologies such as

230
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:17,300
threat modeling I've mentioned earlier

231
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:21,140
applying the design of threats to your

232
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:27,969
product and assess the risks of those

233
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:30,170
words and the concept of TD security

234
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,820
which is a concept that is being

235
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,599
developed by wasp which is very

236
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,610
interesting

237
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:45,800
well you're not just worked in

238
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:47,180
development the testing of that is more

239
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,939
important for me at least in our

240
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,760
assessments this also has a positive

241
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,740
point but when you are developer and you

242
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,819
know your product and you know both the

243
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:02,209
drama's are in fact you're doing a test

244
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:04,600
in an analysis of the problem that you

245
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,599
may have

246
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,650
towards you have all you have programmed

247
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,060
however if you give it to an external

248
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,699
company someone who doesn't know you

249
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,290
probably they test it comprehensively

250
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:22,680
maybe with this you can get a soft

251
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:25,160
shoulder and what's the concern it's

252
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,890
important to understand the risks and

253
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,800
this is connected to what we are above

254
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:36,000
it's not just design but also keeping in

255
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,540
mind all the risks that may be brought

256
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,800
about by having certain software

257
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:45,360
assuming with the whole set of

258
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,430
developers and project managers so they

259
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,740
show different abilities or problems or

260
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:54,479
mechanize and you very sorry which users

261
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,470
have a system but also the ones are not

262
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,030
going to use it product I'm gonna spoil

263
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,260
it to get a profit out of it

264
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,260
so you need to keep in mind

265
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,070
get a short of time you need to respect

266
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:12,580
the process and in the way of doing the

267
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,580
software developers

268
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:23,290
and we usually despise the work well we

269
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:27,040
should be applying much better the

270
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:31,120
awareness of how much our work is worth

271
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:35,650
and how some people keep in mind

272
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:39,190
and some people spice it usually in top

273
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:42,189
levels and last training it's important

274
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:45,700
that companies can give their employees

275
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:50,580
security training that's one more than

276
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,580
most important elements to comply with

277
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:05,990
everyone does a bit for secure software

278
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,510
development

279
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:13,909
and after all of this the conclusions

280
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:15,770
are I personally I'm very concerned with

281
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:18,610
a number of vulnerabilities and problems

282
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,609
are being found

283
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:32,690
the software in production constantly

284
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:37,760
and I'm not sure that's positive for our

285
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:39,470
software however we do have a massive

286
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:46,610
amount of resources that we can apply to

287
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:50,210
our software software that is not

288
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:52,750
suffering attacks from people who trying

289
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,750
to spoil it

290
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,660
so will we need to give these talk again

291
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,660
thank you very much

292
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:21,310
hello thank you for your talk

293
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,409
so I have a question on the usage of

294
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,010
semantic version do you think that most

295
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,450
development teams know about it about

296
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,520
semantic version do you think the

297
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:38,860
development teams know about it and

298
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:44,500
secondly they is your strategy feasible

299
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:49,110
in agile strong project sorts of

300
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:51,910
projects sort of methodology fits

301
00:18:49,110 --> 00:19:00,129
brainstorming is one of the parts of our

302
00:18:51,910 --> 00:19:03,250
j'l do you talk as a whole but he's just

303
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:06,130
not focused for what we're trying to

304
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:09,900
approach here you supply it and to make

305
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,900
people aware what the father Enterprise

306
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:20,760
about sometimes to think on the promises

307
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:22,960
of from my house not just for the

308
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:28,230
percentages of the product to bring get

309
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,230
ahead without in the first question

310
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,760
I see that Mouse Avella purrs I mean

311
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:40,440
other ones who come to these conferences

312
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:45,450
are not able to apply certain techniques

313
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:48,520
and I don't think I'm selling one of the

314
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,380
Flies I don't think we were able to give

315
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,430
the right value the software and the

316
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,790
final quality to apply that kind of

317
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,790
technique

318
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,340
any other questions

319
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:18,730
thank you for your speech regarding the

320
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:24,600
internals tool development which quality

321
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:28,780
would you suggest security techniques

322
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:31,120
well tools for testing all the wrong

323
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,610
tools that you wanna use afterwards well

324
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,709
tools developed in the company maybe for

325
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:41,490
people maybe that generate files you

326
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,490
know do things

327
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:49,980
these are usually small tools they have

328
00:20:48,700 --> 00:21:01,030
their own requirements

329
00:20:49,980 --> 00:21:03,400
well in fact responsibilities and

330
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,570
there's even a big buildup because our

331
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:10,660
problem is gonna be launched my public

332
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:13,480
is gonna be an internal tool so devoting

333
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:17,620
sources from the company to bring get

334
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,550
out there and do it may be very costly

335
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:23,560
and very beneficial maybe one person

336
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:27,030
will benefit from that if they know that

337
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,030
they have various in program

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,760
to manage to have access and resources

339
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,580
in the company what you not securitize

340
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,620
say communications channel because empty

341
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,780
may happen and so on me how hacking

342
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,000
techniques and yelling to that child

343
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,350
listen to your conversations because

344
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,230
eventually the company has not given

345
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:52,750
value to that to be honest I haven't

346
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,210
thought about it from the internal to

347
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,180
perspective might need to are to assess

348
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,760
whether at all comes in process is

349
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,520
necessary to account because in the

350
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:09,629
lifecycle of an application you use that

351
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:12,160
too may be done too it's giving you a

352
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,700
way of doing things so we might need to

353
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,700
look about

354
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:27,249
show different opinions these kinds of

355
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:29,309
these kind of ideas will be very

356
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:31,539
interesting thank you

357
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:36,220
okay we do have time for yet another

358
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:38,020
question hi

359
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,710
congratulations for your speeches be

360
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,710
very interesting

361
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,960
and I'll talk about some problem I see

362
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:47,580
very often people who work on

363
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,729
development are not usually interested

364
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,109
in security and people who do security

365
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:56,429
are not usually very interesting

366
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:58,949
development in fact occurs hardly know

367
00:22:56,429 --> 00:23:03,299
how to velop in Java and other big

368
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:05,159
applications so I wanted to mention it's

369
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,918
do you think that we should go to the

370
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,200
model well we'll be there in two

371
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,359
thousand teams people who know how to

372
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,979
develop about security instead of

373
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,839
developing edges review they call

374
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:19,169
security

375
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:20,309
well losing the secures vermin process

376
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:24,499
and by the way thank you for the

377
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:29,460
question you need to have a team in

378
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:31,289
charge of security in that project that

379
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,580
is application is not just development

380
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:37,940
we want to develop it securely in my

381
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,939
face

382
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:45,560
jobs are worked as a developer and where

383
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:48,550
he transferred security to end a person

384
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:52,280
evaluated rather than we've been testing

385
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:54,290
the product now and I also have a

386
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:58,879
certain controversy controversy with

387
00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:00,620
that problem because those two extremes

388
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,420
are kind of a so isolated from each

389
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,919
other some people might share it but

390
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:11,650
someone wants to do hacking is not

391
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:16,220
giving value-oriented unique team of

392
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:19,180
infrastructure get out so I think that

393
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,470
is necessary for companies to include

394
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:25,510
there are some people with security

395
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:28,610
knowledge also that developers don't

396
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:30,560
just have someone specialized but also

397
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:34,699
that they're given that training but

398
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,649
they're given sort of their mind yes you

399
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,440
are threshold

400
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:42,640
well then maybe I would to balance out

401
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:46,570
the two versions of how they're working

402
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,570
thank you very much for your question

403
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,130
thank you much everyone thank you I hope

404
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,130
you enjoyed it thank you
