00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
thank you phil and thank you all so much

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,800
for being here we are so uh excited to

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,880
finally get back together again for

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
security onion conference so who was

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,840
here two years ago

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,240
a good number of folks so do you

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,480
remember this funny little incident that

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
happened like we started off here and

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,840
then at some point i grabbed the

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
microphone i said what's the first rule

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,560
of incident response don't panic and we

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,880
all got up and went down the hall

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
does anybody remember why what happened

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
like what the deal was brandt knows

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,480
the floor was moving so we had some

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,160
folks like on the top road that were

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,559
like uh we just heard a popping sound

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
and the floor moved

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,160
right and so we out of an over abundance

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,960
of caution we decided to take the right

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
approach and very carefully and

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
cautiously proceed down the hallway to

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,960
another room but there was never any

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,879
danger because apparently this whole

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,120
floor is totally solid concrete so it

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,879
wasn't going to come crashing down after

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,920
all

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
so all that to say if you hear a loud

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,799
popping sound this year

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,799
it's probably okay

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,920
we're probably not gonna die probably

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,640
so

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,200
anyway uh we are glad to have you we're

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,920
