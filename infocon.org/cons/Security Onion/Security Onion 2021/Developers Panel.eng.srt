first got interested in computers back

11
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,280
in the mid 80s when we had a commodore

12

all right we've got a lot of really good

50
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,240
questions if you haven't

51
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,040
yet

52
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,919
do so by doing on this panel up here uh

53
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,759
are using the instructions up here on

54
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,560
the screens you can upload questions so

55
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
you can try to move them to the top

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
i'm going to start at the bottom i'm

57
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
sure you're probably going to think

58
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,479
every single one of these questions

59
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,080
because there's one question here that i

60
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,960
really want to make sure you

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
um

62
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,560
okay so

63
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
all right next question

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,479
um there's a question here that's got a

65
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,840
lot of other votes about uh

66
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,960
can you give us more information on the

67
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
changes to security and licensing

68
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,680
in this future

69
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
kind of feels like two questions but i

70
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,479
feel like it's more centered around

71
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
licensing so

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,410
who wants to feel that

73
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,459
[Music]

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,960
all right so

75
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
you know licensing is a great topic um

76
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,039
you know i've been involved in freedom

77
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,680
or software since 1997

78
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,600
i first learned of this concept of free

79
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,360
open source software and kind of blew my

80
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,240
mind

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,319
uh so involving a lot of different open

82
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,720
source communities for many years by

83
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,759
2008 it was time for me to start my own

84
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,479
open project and so

85
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,720
uh very much committed to

86
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
being a free and open project for the

87
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,560
long term

88
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,639
you know we are providing

89
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,560
commercial features and commercial

90
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
products around that core

91
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
free and open product but

92
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,360
you know no change to really no plans to

93
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,400
change that anytime soon um you know we

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,759
hear from time to time different

95
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,240
components changing their licensing uh

96
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
one that was hinted at earlier is the

97
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,600
hive they basically made a change in

98
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
their licensing

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,080
uh we had already had plans to kind of

100
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,560
change that we're doing case management

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
in the future and so when they made

102
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
their announcement they were changing

103
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,639
their license

104
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,880
the decision that we had already made

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,680
so

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
you know we're committed you know even

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
though other projects may change their

108
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,479
licensing from time to time we're

109
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,840
committed to

110
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,479
continuing to go forward with a freedom

111
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,479
platform

112
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,039
besides

113
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,360
[Music]

114
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
regarding centos and operating system

115
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,639
going forward

116
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,840
so i think there's a little bit of

117
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,120
misunderstanding that probably needs to

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,080
be clarified about cenos and the end of

119
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,319
life on maybe one particular version by

120
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
the version we use there's a lot of

121
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,560
confusion specifically in one of our

122
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,080
customer articles that has that

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,599
misunderstanding a lot definitely would

124
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,599
love to kind of hear what your thoughts

125
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,639
our minds on future operating systems of

126
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,840
security

127
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,240
yeah so our plans are to keep supporting

128
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,879
but the main platform is what you

129
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,400
probably should on that probably it's

130
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,120
going to shift to rocky mountains

131
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,720
there's a huge brush

132
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
has a few more years of support so

133
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,720
the goal right now is

134
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,960
switch

135
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,679
um

136
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,760
all right so next

137
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,880
um this

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
but this is uh let's give you something

139
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
mr john brauer um can you give us any

140
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,480
advice about using security onion tools

141
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,070
for detecting lateral movements

142
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,480
[Music]

143
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,040
sure so

144
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,240
onion has the um

145
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,760
to uh obviously adjust both network data

146
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,680
as well as endpoint data

147
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
logs from other applications and so from

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
a lateral movement perspective we can

149
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
detect that either from the network side

150
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,000
of things or endpoint side of things

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
specifically endpoints we have playbook

152
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
the component that's a little bit

153
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,000
earlier

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
which has sigma rules built in and

155
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
there's quite a number of signal rules

156
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,959
that target

157
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,959
different

158
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,720
different log sources like built-in

159
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
windows event logs as well as system

160
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,000
logs

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
and so

162
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,560
you know being able to bring those

163
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
that log source into security onion and

164
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,480
then enable those plays in playbook will

165
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,839
definitely get you at least from an

166
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
alerting perspective will get you the

167
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
ability to generate alerts off of that

168
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
you can always go over to hunt and use

169
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
some manually hunting or

170
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,200
manual hunting um looking for lab

171
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
improvement so you can look at it both

172
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
from the automated alerting from signal

173
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,319
rules and things like that as well as um

176
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,839
so

177
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:34,880
so

178
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
rather than as a builder an

179
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,839
authentication platform into security

180
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,440
we all need to use another open source

181
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,760
project

182
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,920
and that's provided by a organization

183
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,880
called

184
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
ori

185
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,240
it's a germany-based

186
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,880
organization but lots of resource

187
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,760
controls throughout the world

188
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,519
so we're really

189
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
relying on them to provide these

190
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
capabilities and

191
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
when it comes to student scion they do

192
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,959
offer

193
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,800
additional

194
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,519
projects in that ecosystem

195
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,200
to support that

196
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,399
so

197
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,760
we have the doors open for us to do more

198
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,920
um one of the things that we have to be

199
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,720
mindful of is the licensing restrictions

200
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
that we're faced with the third

201
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,640
marketing projects that we integrate and

202
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,000
security

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,160
and so if those third projects have

204
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,800
license restrictions on free version

205
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,839
then it limits what we can do and

206
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,480
our limit as far as we can go with the

207
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,839
single sign

208
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,959
so we are looking at it we're constantly

209
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,800
trying to find ways to make the whole

210
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
experience

211
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,800
um

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
uh

213
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,200

[Music]

216
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,880
for the most part i think they are

217
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,839
fairly

218
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,000
is another as far as

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,639
capability from an analyst perspective

220
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
or from collecting data and being able

221
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,760
to see the same types of data i think

222
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
from my perspective it's pretty pretty

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
close but

224
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
yeah the main difference is the

225
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,120
filtering so we did uh certified at

226
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,240
filtering

227
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,360
um you can get a little bit of a

228
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,279
granular position but i mean it's really

229
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,560
filtering it

230
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
does file the structure does everything

231
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,000
that is

232
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
is that

233
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,719
act on the same perspective

234
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,480
specifically

235
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,000
um like jason said uh we are using

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,680
a third product in there and like you

237
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,839
said there are licensing prescriptions

238
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,760
some products to enable that type of

239
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
authentication you have to

240
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,600
pay for your license

241
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,839
so

242
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,079
this doesn't happen

243
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,890
[Music]

244
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,639
um let's talk about encrypted data uh

245
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,399
here's one question here is it kind of

246
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,800
specific about you know screening

247
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,639
doesn't have a way to recognize

248
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,800
encrypted data not through i'm not

249
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,160
talking about partially compared to data

250
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,240
but to filter out data that's not

251
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
encrypted

252
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,880
and there's several people go to this

253
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,320
question so

254
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,160
the question is why does the security

255
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
element detect encrypted data and allow

256
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,240
us to filter it out

257
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,240
completely

258
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
so

259
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,120
there are things you can do

260
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,880
to

261
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,240
try and filter out the data a lot of

262
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
times we do on the cap side

263
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,440
it's just it's a challenge but it's

264
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,120
really limited to the tools that we use

265
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,079
so we don't

266
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,320
do anything special to the tools to

267
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,079
enable them to do anything special

268
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
you know our focus

269
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,839
is

270
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,720
really

271
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,959
on bringing in that negative as

272
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959

north cell traffic

privacy perspective but not separate

from a security monitoring perspective

between that as well as

280
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,000
work from home challenges we've covered

281
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
the last year and a half and just many

282
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,799
people work

283
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,240
from home and the

284
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,559
lack of

285
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,919
visibility into network data for our

organizations

287
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,320
we want to continue to augment that with

288
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,480
any other types of data that's available

289
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,039
whether that's data generated by

290
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
applications or from the endpoint

291
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,880
perspective so i'll just put another

292
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
plug-in here for the

293
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,360
the point that inside security we have

294
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,720
the ability to do

295
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,240
things like pose query or quasi or wind

296
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,559
lobbies or beats or

297
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,360
velociraptor from wess's integration so

298
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
being able to pull in that data as much

299
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,919
as possible i always think the about

300
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,160
looking at a puzzle and how as an

301
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
analyst you see an alert that's one

302
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
piece of the puzzle that you pivot from

303
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,799
there going over to z clause that's

304
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,039
another piece of the puzzle then you

305
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
pivot over to cismod data from the

306
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
community id and that's another piece of

307
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,679
the puzzle pretty soon you're now able

308
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,320
to put this puzzle together and see

309
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
the whole view of what's going on in

310
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,000
your network being able to bring in

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
those different data types so definitely

312
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
encrypted data we don't you know we can

313
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
glean value from that in a variety of

314
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
different ways but we definitely want to

315
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,360
make sure we're augmenting that so just

316

another plug to continue to look at

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
funding to work with

349
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,240
the combined elastic agents

350
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,159
yeah so the last thing is partner of

351
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,799
a lot of work with them specifically to

352
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,200
integrate more closely with them

353
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,919
and that includes their existing lineup

354
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,120
of agents and their kind of super agents

355
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
to come so we're working very closely

356
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,200
with them to make sure that we're trying

357
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,960
to keep in lockstep with everything that

358
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,360
they're doing uh which as you may have

359
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,240
noticed

360
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,280
elastic is very very agile they are

361
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,799
moving very very quickly and uh it's

362
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,559
it's a challenge to keep pace they're

363
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,799
moving so really quickly but we are

364
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,720
doing what i feel is a pretty good job

365
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
of keeping pace with their innovation

366
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,880
and keeping in lockstep with them so

367
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,480
definitely expect to see some more

368
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,960
things around their elastic agent

369
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,280
we're looking at all kinds of different

370
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,120
client tools

371
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,200
to bring in so again we

372
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,799
identify as a huge need due to

373
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,320
the encouraging stuff that's going on so

374
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,080
just kind of

375
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,710
hit that

376
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,240
[Music]

377
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,360
the drive so it's not just

378
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,290
all the goodness

379
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,490
[Music]

380
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,039
are there any

381
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
excuse me so you are just using a normal

382
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,039
forward node right so if you have that

383
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,320
deployed in a cloud environment like aws

384
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,480
maybe convert it over

385
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,039
other than making sure like triple

386
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,799
checking is not accessible from your

387
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,840
public internet um

388
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,799
[Music]

389
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,480
why is the entire code structure

390
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,559
security in a mix

391
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,440
of different things like bash

392
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,039
you know we use asterisks to do some

393
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,200
things all kinds of things

394
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,559
uh docker to do some things

395
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,280
it's been expounding the question here

396
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
why not just consolidate into a main

397
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,720
language

398
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,679
um

399
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,640
and it goes into

400
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,799
so why not why not just consolidate one

401
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,640
big giant

402
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,279

[Music]

404
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,039
i think

405
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,840
you know

406
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,520
[Music]

407
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,520
is

408
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,309
[Music]

409
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,440
uh

410
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,720
so that's

411
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,400
doesn't have

412
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,840
anything on it

413
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,559
correct

414
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
i would say

415
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,880
you're gonna try one

416
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,679
on what we're trying to do

417
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,799
you know so

418
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,400
we can spend our time

419
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,320
building out things like an alert

420
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,360
interface

421
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,880
or we can spend our time trying to

422
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
rebuild salt in

423
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,480
go or some other common language

424
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,319
[Music]

425
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,080
all right so let's see here again if you

426
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,320
have any other questions

427
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:33,460
[Music]

428
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,559
there's an automation serious question

429
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,960
here which

430
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:48,930
[Music]

431
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,640
documentation

432
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,200
combination

433
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,679
i'm guessing they're talking about the

434
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,520
set of flash combinations where traders

435
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,960
contain the

436
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
uh they're basically

437
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,080
uh

438
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,919
variables for

439
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,400
testing automating our testing of

440
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,720
security and creative release

441
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,600
and

442
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,440
we have them right where we want them as

443
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,600
far as how they suit us

444
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,320
because that's what they were intended

445
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,159
testing so that we don't have to do

446
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,320
everything manually every time you do a

447
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
release and if you're you're watching

448
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,799
along in the forums or the blogs or

449
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,320
twitter

450
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
group releasing quite often it's not a

451
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,520
full release there's

452
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
um all right so these other ones are

453
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,720
about the other integrations and maybe

454
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,600
less

455
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,679
there's a question about uh

456
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,919
potential and this could be a market

457
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,360
question as well the potential for

458
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,320
integrated velociraptor natively any

459
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
thought or consideration

460
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,559
to that might be best for you

461
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,799
we don't have any

462
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,520
um

463
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,739
[Music]

464
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,819
[Music]

465
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,520
i've got one more question for every

466
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,420
[Music]

467
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,880
well it's

468
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,360
not that i'm proud of it but i'm happy

469
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,799
with how it turned out and that's the

470
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,919
modularity of the building portion of

471
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:34,960
the sock

472
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,480
and

473
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,840
what i mean by that is from the

474
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,640
beginning um

475
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
all of the integration to external

476
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,080
products like crate case i mentioned

477
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,720
earlier or even elastic search

478
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,320
all of those are

479
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
funded by an interface that allows us to

480
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,799
plug in a different module if we need to

481
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,399
so thinking back to

482
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,120
what's this longer 50 sensors

483
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,799
you'd have to go and click on each

484
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,720
dashboard and kind of see what was going

485
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,600
on

486
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,399
in your environment

487
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,370
um

488
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,570
[Music]

489
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,690
um

490
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,789
[Music]

491
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,279
um

492
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
quick and simple way to

493
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,360
spit up new detections

494
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,960
and um

495
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,799
long term and kind of have some

496
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,240
animation in the background and so

497
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
that's where kind of the playbook

498
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,840
concept started and then eventually

499
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,639
brought that into

500
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,799
of the more recent ones and it's really

501
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,880
a team effort

502
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,159
but

503
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,440
getting the

504
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,840
volume module functionality built in to

505
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,559
your security to be able to flip on

506
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,840
uh really quickly so many different

507
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,279
sources of telemetry and logs and

508
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,120
different types of data

509
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
really helps to scale the power of

510
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
security to

511
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,960
enterprise security monitoring which is

512
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,919
what we try to advocate for

513
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,679
so really really happy about that and

514
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,360
then also jason

515
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,159
with

516
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,799
the aws file image and just but trying

517
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,919
to

518
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,600
be involved with that and getting more

519
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,760
of the cloud stuff and

520
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,039
data telemetry just

521
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,720
mine's not really a future or anything

522
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,799
um mine is more of a

523
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,760
it's a higher level thing and that is uh

524
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,159
four years ago i was sitting basement

525
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,440
and

526
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,279
we both had some visions and we worked

527
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,399
on combining that vision

528
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,919
[Music]

529
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,039
it starts to make

530
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,750
[Music]

531
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:08,960
and

532
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,679
it was just a hobby project and was able

533
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,120
to kind of maintain it throughout the

534
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,640
years make it a little bit better over

535
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,840
the years and

536
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
add things here and

537
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,679
streamline things there

538
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,519
but ultimately mike and the rest of the

539
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,360
team have really kind of taken that to

540
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,679
the whole a whole other level of

541
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,840
security on youtube it's more powerful

542
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,760
it's more scalable it's more

543
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,840
configurable it's got more bells and

544
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,360
whistles

545
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,840
and so it's an amazing

546
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,600
amount of

547
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,399
just elevation of a platform that i'm

548
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,000
very very proud of

549
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,320
then i could also say things like

550
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,480
you know the hunt interface i built the

551
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,559
prototype for that

552
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,399
and it was okay

553
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,200
but jason took it to a whole other level

554
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,000
because he's 100 000 billion times the

555
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,679
developer that i could ever dream of

556
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,559
being

557
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,880
and there's many times where i might

558
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,760
submit a github pull request

559
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,000
and as much as i think that i've double

560
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
checked it and triple tricked it and

561
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,599
quadruple checked it

562
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,359
jason will always find something to

563
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,199
improve on it so

564
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,839
um these guys have done an amazing job

565
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,359
so i think what i would say that i'm

566
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,319
most proud of

567
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,110
[Music]

568
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,719
and passionate about those ideas but we

569
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,399
come up with great ideas

570
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,879
and we execute on those great ideas and

571
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,719
make great products so

572
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,480
i'm proud of you guys part of the team

573
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,159
we've built thank you for all that you

574
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,320
do

575
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,040
and we

576
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,639
all right

577
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,720
all right

578
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,240
[Applause]

579
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
[Music]

580
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,000
all right so we reached afternoon break

581
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
time
