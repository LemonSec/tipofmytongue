00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,440
she's done for this conference

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,719
so let's give him another round of

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,719
applause

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,320
i stand on the shoulders of giants and

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,399
that's that crowd over there like these

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,719
folks do all the work

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,079
so that

19
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,000
i can do what i do right i couldn't do

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,520
without them and i literally mean the

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,079
shoulders of giants so chris and matt

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,760
these guys are like six foot five

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
they're giants

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,880
and i was telling somebody just a few

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,360
minutes ago it's so funny because

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,159
the many of these folks work remote you

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,520
know and especially over the past couple

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,759
of years we've had to hire folks

29
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,880
remotely

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,400
over webex

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
never meeting in person until just the

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
other night

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,600
right so you can imagine having met a

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,080
person over webex you kind of envision

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,520
kind of what you think they look like

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,640
and then they show up in person you're

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
like that's chris's face but it's on the

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,240
six foot five frame and i wasn't

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,640
expecting that it's kind of weird

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
anyway so

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040

for writing thank you notes and then

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360

90
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280

100
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,400
i kind of feel like that's been this

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,239
week like i've been kind of busy like

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,319
all the preparations that went into

103
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,400
today like i haven't had a whole lot of

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
time

105
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,159
to do the things that i need to do

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,360
so one of those things is the

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,400
daily

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
quick malware analysis blog post have

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,319
you seen these things we've been putting

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,839
them out for the last few weeks

111
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
i wasn't asking for applause but i'll

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,680
take it i'll take it

113
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,040
no

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,960
so this is a fun thing that we started

115
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
doing a few weeks ago if you haven't

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,040
seen it where we go out and we take like

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
a pcapp sample

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,759
and

119
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,919
run that into security onion and then

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,720
take a few screenshots of some alerts

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
some zeke logs some interesting sessions

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
from the full packet capture and

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,840
just put that out there on the blog and

124
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
on social media so that folks kind of

125
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,479
see what modern day attacks actually

126
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,919
look like some of the things that you

127
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,840
might want to be looking for

128
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,440
in your environment so we're doing that

129
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,080
every single day and have had a really

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,919
great response to it like folks really

131
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
seem to dig it a good bit well i did i

132
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,400
think on monday and tuesday and

133
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,680
wednesday of this week but like

134
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
yesterday i just didn't even have the

135
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
time so

136
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,639
with apologies to jimmy fallon

137
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,120
i haven't had time to do it so i thought

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,440
if you don't mind we do a little quick

139
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,280
malware analysis is that okay with you

140
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,280
so

141
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
you know it's at this point that i would

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
ask james you know for some

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
quick malware analysis music

144
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,919
james is not impressed with my

145
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,240
shenanigans you know he normally giggles

146
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
with jimmy but he's not giggling for me

147
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,800
so

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,160
i guess i don't get any quick malware

149
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,600
analysis music

150
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
womp womp so let's do some quick malware

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,639
analysis

152
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,039
all right so we've got the latest

153
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,960
version of security onion here

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,240
so what i've done is i've taken a pcap

155
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,880
and i've imported it into security onion

156
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
using a tool that we have called so

157
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,319
import pcap and if you haven't used this

158
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,479
it's really a great way

159
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,639
to get your feet wet with security on

160
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
you reason being is that you can do this

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,639
in a minimal virtual machine only one

162
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,960
network interface only four gigabytes of

163
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,039
ram you don't have to have a big

164
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
whopping machine

165
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,319
and you can do this really quickly and

166
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,919
easily it's a great way to get some

167
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,479
experience not only with security onion

168
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
but with malware analysis and threat

169
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
hunting and all that great fun stuff

170
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,199
that we do

171
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
so i've taken this pcapp i've imported

172
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,319
it so at this point the the pcap the

173
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,199
traffic in that pcapp was run through

174
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,280
surreycotta to generate alerts it was

175
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,840
run through zeek to generate logs

176
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,000
and it was stored where we could then

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
pull the full packet capture if we want

178
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,639
to pivot to that kind of stuff

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,919
so

180
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,280
here we go let's take a look at alerts

181
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,319
so

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,319
looking here at our alerts page we do

183
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,360
have one alert what do you know

184
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
this is in the emerging threats rule set

185
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,919
it's in the policy category

186
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,360
and it's for a curl user agent outbound

187
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,599
now this could be totally legitimate

188
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,000
traffic you might have you know plenty

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,759
of legitimate uses of curl in your

190
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,599
environment but in other environments

191
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,080
that are more locked down you might have

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
no legitimate uses for curl and so this

193
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,280
might be

194
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,199
interesting

195
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,280
so let's drill into this particular

196
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,520
alert

197
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,720
and you know we could go and

198
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,400
kind of open this alert up and we could

199
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,720
take a look at some of the data within

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,639
the alert itself

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,240
but you know me i'm kind of a full

202
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
packet capture kind of a guy i like to

203
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,919
see the packets so

204
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,000
let's click on here and let's go down to

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
actions

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,440
and then go to pcapp

207
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,840
all right so here's what we see

208
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
up at the very top we see an http get

209
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
request for a file called file.dat it's

210
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,759
coming from a web server at 192.168.1.83

211
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,360
and there we see on the third line the

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,280
user agent string of curl version

213
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,520
755.1 and that user agent string is why

214
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,440
the alert fired in the first place we

215
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
could take a look at the rule that

216
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,560
generated that alert we can confirm all

217
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,240
of that stuff but here we do in fact

218
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,120
see

219
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
that this is a true positive that the

220
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,279
alert fired on traffic coming from a

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,080
user agent of curl okay that's cool

222
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,240
but the plot thickens because then we

223
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,120
see the web server's response http 200

224
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,399
okay

225
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,320
we see an interesting server name this

226
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,680
is simple http that's not like

227
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,839
a normal web server you would see out on

228
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,720
the internet like apache or iis or some

229
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
other

230
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
kind of production web server

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,680
and then we see content type application

232
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,640
octet stream so this file was called

233
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,000
file.dat which doesn't really tell us a

234
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
whole lot right that could mean a few

235
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
different things and application octet

236
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
stream doesn't really tell us you know

237
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,360
it's we don't know if it's a word

238
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,920
document or an exe or pdf or whatever

239
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
the case might be

240
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
so then we have this stuff down here

241
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,720
what does this appear to be

242
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,959
ah okay we see a whole bunch of zeros

243
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,439
and ones

244
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,399
so

245
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
what we could do

246
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
is

247
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
this resolution is

248
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,240
getting to me we could

249
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,720
take this pcap

250
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
and use one of our recent

251
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
upgrades which is being able to pivot

252
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,480
directly from this pcap over to cyber

253
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,200
chef any cyber chef fans here

254
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,279
love me some cyber chef right it's this

255
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,519
great tool allows you to do all kinds of

256
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,000
decoding and analysis type stuff so we

257
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
click this one button and it's going to

258
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,959
take our

259
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,360
session it's going to send it over to

260
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
cyber chef

261
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
in hex dump format

262
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,800
and it's going to automatically tell

263
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,760
cyber chef to apply the from hex dump

264
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
recipe you see that in the middle column

265
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
there

266
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
and then in the output pane

267
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
you get to see that session in a more

268
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
readable format than the hex dump that's

269
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
up here all right very cool so we're

270
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
kind of back to where we were before at

271
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,640
this

272
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,480
at this output box

273
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,160
but we have all the power of cyber chef

274
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,839
at our disposal

275
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,200
so

276
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,120
now that we have all that power

277
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
how might we go about kind of digging in

278
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,399
to those zeros and ones that were at the

279
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,440
bottom of this pcap

280
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,120
i thought we had some cyber chef fans

281
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,279
all right well how about this how about

282
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,240
we start with like a habit that i'm in

283
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
is if i'm looking at http traffic the

284
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,079
first thing i might want to do is kind

285
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,800
of strip those headers off right so i

286
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,320
could go up here and search for strip

287
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
http headers and if i just double click

288
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,079
that that brings the recipe over here

289
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,640
and it applies it to the output and so

290
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,600
now we see that that first set of http

291
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,480
headers that had the http get request

292
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,320
that's been stripped off

293
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
now we're left with the http headers

294
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,640
from the web server

295
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,079
so we could manually apply strip http

296
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,920
headers again but

297
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,720
if you'll notice cyber chef has this

298
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
nice little magic wand here and if i

299
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,320
hover over the magic wand it tells me

300
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
that if you apply strip http headers it

301
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
will produce this other output

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,240
so it's like cyber chef read my mind or

303
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,399
something right so i click the magic

304
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,920
wand

305
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,399
it applies the strip http headers

306
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
now we're down to just the raw zeros and

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,639
ones which is really where we want to be

308
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,000
all right so at this point

309
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,800
what do we want to do

310
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,480
so if we apply the from binary recipe

311
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
all right it's going to kind of peel

312
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
back one layer of this little puzzle

313
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,839
that we have in front of us what are we

314
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,360
left with now in the output pane

315
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,079
i think i heard something from over here

316
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,600
all right i heard hex so what if we

317
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,880
apply from hex

318
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,279
aha

319
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,440
the plot thickens we've peeled back one

320
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,519
more layer

321
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,639
notice we have another magic wand here

322
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,720
so this magic wand when i hover over it

323
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,839
says

324
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,079
you can apply from base64 so it's

325
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,000
identified that what's in that output

326
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,160
pane is base64 encoded okay cool

327
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,959
and then after applying the from base64

328
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,560
recipe

329
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
it will then

330
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
automatically render

331
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,279
what it's seeing as an image

332
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,120
interesting

333
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,000
should we click the magic wand

334
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
yes we should

335
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,480
yes yes

336
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
all right

337
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,160
unfortunately the resolution kind of

338
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,399
kind of messes with us here how can i

339
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,399
resize this to get it where i want it to

340
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
be

341
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,199
where is he

342
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,360
where's paul

343
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,959
there he is

344
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,920
that's for you buddy

345
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,560
yo dog we heard you liking coding

346
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,199
yep all right

347
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,480
so

348
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,800
that's kind of cool and all right

349
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,000
so now you can very easily take and go

350
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,279
from an alert

351
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,160
to pcapp to cyber chef you can use cyber

352
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,320
chef to peel back the layers and you can

353
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
find exhibit in your network traffic

354
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,240
right

355
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,959
that's a fun time but wait

356
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,959
there's more

357
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,720
so if i go back to alerts

358
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,519
and i go back to my alert and i click

359
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,600
and get my action menu go down to

360
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
actions

361
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,160
before we clicked pcap we have this

362
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,639
other great option that we added called

363
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,480
correlate this is one of my favorite

364
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,040
things to do because what correlate does

365
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,000
is it uses community id

366
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
to say okay for this particular piece of

367
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
traffic with this source ip this source

368
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,160
port destination ip destination port we

369
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,199
create essentially a hash that uniquely

370
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,360
identifies that connection

371
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,160
now

372
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
let's look for that hash in any other

373
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
log that we might have anywhere

374
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,040
from suricata from zeek from other data

375
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,360
types as well so if you look at this

376
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
output you'll see that i have a cericada

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,040
alert that's what we started with okay

378
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,959
above that we have two

379
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,199
zeek logs so we have the connection log

380
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,519
in the http log we've already looked at

381
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,360
the the full packet capture so looking

382
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
at those z clocks it's not really going

383
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,519
to give us any more information than we

384
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,000
already had but what's the fourth log

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,399
down there

386
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,000
hey now that's kind of neat

387
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,920
what if i click on that and then click

388
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,759
include just to kind of filter down to

389
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,639
that

390
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,600
so now i've got a sysmon log now wait a

391
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,800
minute

392
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
sysmon

393
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,560
let's back up a minute right because

394
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,480
zeke and surikata

395
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,880
both can natively generate community id

396
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,160
but does cis mon do that

397
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,360
no sysmon doesn't how did we get that

398
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,399
well when that log comes in we tell

399
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,720
elasticsearch to automatically

400
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,040
dynamically generate that community id

401
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,240
value on the fly so that means then that

402
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,880
we can correlate from our network data

403
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,000
to our host data and vice versa very

404
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,839
cool

405
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,639
so

406
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,399
where is all this going well what that

407
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,360
means is i can actually see the process

408
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,519
on windows box that generated that data

409
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,600
right i can actually go into this

410
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
again my resolution is a little bit

411
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,320
sub-optimal but we can see all of the

412
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,360
fields here and if we drill into

413
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,320
uh the particular field it's going to

414
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,720
show us the actual curl binary that

415
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,000
generated

416
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,120
that traffic in the first place right

417
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,639
so i can also do things like

418
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,599
see if i can find it

419
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,160
the resolution is messing with me here

420
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,760
let's see if i can

421
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,240
hunt for this

422
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,799
here we go

423
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,319
so let's see we were looking at the

424
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,679
sysmond network connection log and

425
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,440
we then took

426
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
kind of a piece of that log and we

427
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
hunted on that so that we could then

428
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,840
find this other sysmon log for process

429
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,039
creation

430
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,960
right so you kind of see this journey of

431
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,360
being able to tie all of these different

432
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,960
logs together

433
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,480
and that's really one thing that we've

434
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,520
worked very hard in trying to build this

435
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
interface that makes it

436
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,480
so cohesive to bring all of these logs

437
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,320
together and to pivot from one data type

438
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,039
to another both network and host and

439
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,400
vice versa

440
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,520
so

441
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,679
that's our our quick little

442
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,039
let me show this if i can

443
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,960
if the

444
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,720
resolution won't mess with me too bad

445
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,520
so what we can do is we could do

446
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,000
something like

447
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,559
group by the parent command line

448
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,960
yeah this resolution makes it a little

449
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,799
bit difficult

450
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,720
and maybe

451
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,240
the process command line as well

452
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,240
so

453
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,799
those little clicks in the interface

454
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,799
right those are what really kind of make

455
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,440
you efficient as a threat hunter being

456
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,880
able to

457
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
drill all the way down into the

458
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,000
nitty-gritty details and then group by a

459
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,280
particular field and then show that data

460
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360
and stacked this is just a very small

461
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,280
example of course but if you think about

462
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
you know kind of stacking this kind of

463
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
data across your enterprise looking at

464
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
all the processes that were created

465
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,840
looking at parent command line process

466
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,480
command line that then becomes something

467
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,679
very very powerful right

468
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,200
all right so just a very basic example

469
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,360
and and really it's all about paul

470
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
nelson in the end so

471
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,720
thank you paul for inspiring all of us

472
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,039
as always

473
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,640
all right

474
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,260
did you like that little exercise

475
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,120
[Applause]

476
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,840
james still didn't like the exercise

477
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,840
james is hating on me oh well sorry

478
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,240
james so here's the question thinking

479
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,919
about that exercise i said in the

480
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,080
beginning that i did so import pcap to

481
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,640
import the pcap file but how did i get

482
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,960
the host data that came from this brand

483
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,400
new utility called so import

484
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,559
evtx thank you josh brauer

485
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,760
that allows you to take an evtx file

486
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,039
from a windows system and import it into

487
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,600
security onion so now this

488
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,520
thing that we've had traditionally of so

489
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,919
import pcapp it now has this nice twin

490
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,000
brother that can do the same thing from

491
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,159
the host side so now you can have an

492
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,559
import virtual machine very minimal

493
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,320
resources and you can very quickly and

494
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,440
easily import network data and host data

495
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
and you can correlate the two together

496
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,159
in one little vm and you can have that

497
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,200
very quickly and easily

498
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,080
so that's pretty cool stuff but

499
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,640
wait where did so import evtx come from

500
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,120
because it wasn't in version 2.3.70

501
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,679
well

502
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,480
2380 drops today

503
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,960
so version 2380 is out this afternoon it

504
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,600
includes so import evtx

505
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,919
and some other fun stuff too

506
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,280
do you want to hear about the other fun

507
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,600
stuff

508
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,400
okay okay you talked me into it so how

509
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,880
many folks work in security teams of

510
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
more than one person

511
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,760
all right so you're gonna love this

512
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,440
role based access control

513
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
thank you jason ertl

514
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,600
right jason has spent the last couple of

515
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,720
months

516
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
working tirelessly

517
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,159
to bring

518
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,520
solid comprehensive role-based access

519
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,400
control to security onion this includes

520
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,760
not just elasticsearch and cabana

521
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,559
but it's across security onion console

522
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,919
to include

523
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,799
alerts and our hunt interface and pcap

524
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,840
jobs

525
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,799
and

526
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,640
all of the great stuff that you do in

527
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,360
security onion it's now got a standard

528
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,080
and consistent model for role-based

529
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,960
access control so you can define your

530
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,679
super users you can define your analysts

531
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,919
you can fine-tune

532
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,600
down to all of those privileges that you

533
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
see in that chart there

534
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,360
so jason's done a tremendous job with

535
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,200
this so again thank you jason for all

536
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,280
the hard work that went into it

537
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
you can read about this it's already in

538
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,720
our documentation you just go to the

539
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,760
rbac page and it includes this chart and

540
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,400
a whole bunch of information about how

541
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,919
you can access role-based access control

542
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
all right what else well if you're in a

543
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,080
security team chances are you have a

544
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,320
distributed deployment meaning you have

545
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,400
a manager you have multiple search nodes

546
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
you have multiple forward nodes

547
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,880
so when you build your search nodes

548
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,720
traditionally

549
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,000
you would

550
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
have each of those search nodes as

551
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,480
independent elastic

552
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
clusters

553
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,080
they would be managed by the manager and

554
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
the manager would query all of them via

555
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,400
cross cluster search

556
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
something that we've had many requests

557
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,640
for is to do an actual elastic cluster

558
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,880
where those search nodes join to form

559
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,360
one cluster they act as one cohesive

560
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,400
unit

561
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,120
we've actually had this support in place

562
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,039
for a couple of releases although we

563
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,960
haven't really publicized it that much

564
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,280
because it was still kind of taking

565
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,320
shape

566
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
but we're now ready to officially

567
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,200
announce it

568
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,080
so

569
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,919
as you're running setup on a new

570
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,240
installation you choose the advanced

571
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,559
option because this is for advanced

572
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,280
users with advanced use cases

573
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,360
and you can choose that elastic

574
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
clustering you can build search nodes

575
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,000
that join into one cluster

576
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,840
again all this has been documented it's

577
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,000
already in the documentation today so if

578
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,799
you just go to our elasticsearch page

579
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,280
all of that information is out there

580
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,240
right back at you buddy

581
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
all right so as i mentioned it's been in

582
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,039
a few releases we first introduced it in

583
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,520
2321 we've been steadily working on it

584
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,039
but i want to make sure i mention a

585
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,360
couple of warnings and disclaimers we

586
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,919
still recommend for most folks that you

587
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,240
go with our traditional method of of

588
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,559
cross cluster search

589
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,360
because it's easier it's

590
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,679
requires less know-how of elastic

591
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,840
internals it requires less maintenance

592
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,679
and configuration

593
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,200
but if you need if you absolutely need

594
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,520
those advanced features in an elastic

595
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,400
cluster things like replicas and hot and

596
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
warm nodes and things like that you can

597
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,600
absolutely turn this on

598
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,480
but keep in mind that we do not support

599
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,520
in place migration of your existing

600
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,559
cross cluster search deployment this is

601
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,760
only for new installations that supports

602
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,879
elastic clustering

603
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
all right so this is what it looks like

604
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,320
when you're performing a new

605
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,760
installation

606
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,679
you're running through setup

607
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,679
you're building the manager you choose

608
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,840
the advanced option it's going to ask if

609
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,919
you want a traditional elastic search

610
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,120
cluster

611
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,880
and that's specifically for things like

612
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,679
replicas and hot warm indices

613
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,720
and

614
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,880
you fill out the prompts and it will

615
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,240
build a true elastic cluster for you

616
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,960
pretty cool stuff

617
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,799
next up

618
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,640
any cloud users here i think we had a

619
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,600
question about cloud before today

620
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,360
so in addition to our amazon aws image

621
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,760
which has been out for a while now

622
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,559
we now have an azure marketplace image

623
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,840
this is another thing that jason has

624
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,679
been working tirelessly on so thank you

625
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,760
jason for all the blood sweat and tears

626
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,039
that went into that

627
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,840
so

628
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
whether you're in amazon or you're in

629
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
azure we've got an image for both of

630
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,600
those so you can go to securityonion.net

631
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,919
azure it will take you to this page on

632
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,760
the azure marketplace

633
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,360
and you'll be good to go

634
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,880
we've also got documentation that goes

635
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,360
along with that and you can find that in

636
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,279
our standard security.net slash docs

637
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,279
site

638
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
all right so all of our documentation

639
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,720
has been updated for version 2 380.

640
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,600
that's available now

641
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,480
and

642
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
especially for those of you who might be

643
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,200
in air gapped environments or maybe you

644
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,679
just want a portable copy of the

645
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,440
documentation to carry with you that

646
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,120
doesn't require batteries

647
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,799
you can buy the book from amazon today

648
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,840
and that's been updated for 2380 as well

649
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,159
and we're officially over 300 pages in

650
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,799
that documentation keep in mind that the

651
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,640
what's different from the printed

652
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
version to the online version is the

653
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,520
printed version includes uh a very nice

654
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,480
forward by sir richard baitlich

655
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,159
one of my great heroes and role models

656
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,880
of of all time so he wrote the forward

657
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,760
it's also got a discount code for our

658
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,919
online training as well so if you

659
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,600
purchase the book you get a discount

660
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,840
code which easily pays for the price of

661
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,200
the book you can find that at

662
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,039
securityonion.net

663
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,000
book

664
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,279
and the proceeds go to rural technology

665
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,440
fund we heard earlier today from mr

666
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,520
chris sanders and he's one of the

667
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,600
founders of rtf they're doing great work

668
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,520
and so we are

669
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,559
uh

670
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,159
as of today

671
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,600
sending a check to rural tech foundation

672
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,919
for all of the proceeds for the book for

673
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,360
the previous year

674
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,840
and we're also doing a company donation

675
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,159
above and beyond that of

676
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,200
six thousand dollars

677
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,360
so

678
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,240
rural technology fund is a great project

679
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,320
they're doing great work so we're very

680
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
happy to support that um and i highly

681
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,039
recommend to each and every one of you

682
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,600
if you're looking for a worthy project

683
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,480
to support with your funds they do a

684
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,039
great job of getting technology into

685
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,120
schools that so desperately need it

686
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,720
and this is you know something that

687
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,480
really kind of hits home with me because

688
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,880
growing up i grew up on a dirt road my

689
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,399
address was literally

690
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
rural route 2

691
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,720
and so this is something that appeals to

692
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,000
me this is something that i want to

693
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
support and

694
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,600
would love it if others would support it

695
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,080
as well

696
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,559
all right

697
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,880
next up lots of folks have asked for

698
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,960
certification

699
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
you got it all right so if you're ready

700
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,279

701
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,159
the world we've got a new security onion

702
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,640

securityonionsolutions.com

716
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,720
all right so that's certification

717
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,399
another announcement we got a new case

718
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,399
studies course right this is something

719
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,399
we've been talking about for a while

720
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,120
and it's coming really really really

721
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,440
really really really soon all right

722
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,520
we're really excited about it uh josh

723
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,799
brauer and the rest of the folks have

724
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,279
done a lot of work on that so look for

725
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,840
an announcement in the next few weeks

726
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,840
all right so we kind of hinted at this

727
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,720
earlier in the developer panel

728
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,279
in terms of road map and what's coming

729
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,559
next so we're dropping to 380 today

730
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,240
next release will be two three ninety

731
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,399
what's coming then well

732
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,919
support for ubuntu 2004

733
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,679
all right lots of folks have asked for

734
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,399
that

735
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,640
so we're going to be releasing that into

736
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,880
390. mike reeves has already done most

737
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,080
of the work for that so thank you mike

738
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,799
and so when that comes out in 2390 that

739
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,399
might come out as

740
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,960
fresh installs only

741
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,360
supporting ubuntu 2004 because the

742
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,679
process of doing an in-place upgrade

743
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,960
from 18 to 20 might take some additional

744
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
time but we are

745
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,600
pledging to have at least fresh install

746
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,520
support in two three ninety

747
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,159
all right what comes after 2390 the road

748
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,440
ahead

749
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,279
so we started thinking about what are we

750
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,000
going to try to start working on

751
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,480
over the next year

752
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,799
mind you there's no eta on this stuff

753
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,240
this is just stuff that we're going to

754
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,159
start working on one of the things we

755
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,760
mentioned earlier

756
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,600
was case management so currently today

757
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
we're using the hive for our case

758
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,679
management

759
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,520
and i think i mentioned earlier

760
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,360
we had already kind of made a decision

761
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,240
to

762
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,320
kind of go in a different direction for

763
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,919
case management

764
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,679
and then the hive came out a couple of

765
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,440
weeks ago and they announced a licensing

766
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,279
change and that just kind of confirmed

767
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,519
our decision to change our case

768
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,120
management solution

769
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,399
so that's one of the things that we're

770
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,919
going to start working on over the next

771
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,519
year

772
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,679
the next thing and i think mike may have

773
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,519
mentioned this earlier as well

774
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,640
is that we're going to start the

775
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,640
migration from docker to podman right so

776
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
we're still going to be supporting both

777
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
ceno s and

778
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,760
red hat type clones

779
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,640
and also ubuntu and podman will do both

780
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,480
of those all right so

781
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,080
it's going to be really kind of the same

782
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,240
container images it's just going to be

783
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,399
the actual binary that runs that

784
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,080
instantiates those images is going to

785
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,559
change from docker to podman

786
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,200
mike mentioned earlier that in terms of

787
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,279
you know we had a question about cenos 8

788
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,600
and the fact that cinos 8 kind of

789
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,080
had this big surprise uh in terms of

790
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,360
going away

791
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,960
so in terms of us moving from cines7 to

792
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,919
cenos 8 that will actually be to rocky

793
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,279
lennox version 8. so rocky linux is out

794
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,519
now it's stable it's reliable so we're

795
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,159
going to start working on that support

796
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,279
for rocky linux 8.

797
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,000
and then finally you know

798
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,679
there's a lot of things that we want to

799
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,960
do inside of security onion console

800
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,039
there's a lot of web management stuff

801
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,760
that we want to enable you to do

802
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,840
so you can do more pointy clicky stuff

803
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,480
rather than typey typey stuff all right

804
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,880
so we're going to start working on more

805
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,480
web management for the grid

806
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,880
all right

807
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,440
question so far

808
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,039
i'm building anticipation because you

809
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,279
all want to know what the one last thing

810
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,960
is

811
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
don't you

812
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,720
yes you

813
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,200
do hmm

814
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,640
maybe i'll just take a sip of water

815
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,080
so a little bit of backstory

816
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,440
a couple of years ago you may remember

817
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,519
we announced official

818
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,039
security onion solutions appliances

819
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,799
these are standard 1u and 2u rackmount

820
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,320
boxes

821
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,039
and we partnered with dell dell's been a

822
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,840
great partner in providing really great

823
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
hardware and we've got some some nice

824
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,919
kind of custom hardware uh and some of

825
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,279
those models

826
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,600
and so this has been really a great

827
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,000
partnership that's enabled folks to have

828
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,960
a really turnkey operation so that we

829
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,559
can drop ship them a box and it's

830
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,519
already got our software installed it's

831
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,360
a whole lot easier more streamlined

832
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,840
process than having to go through their

833
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,240
standard procurement cycles get some box

834
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,760
off the shelf and then go and install

835
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,480
our software and hope that all the

836
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,640
hardware works as intended and getting

837
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,799
its specs just right so this has been a

838
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,559
really great thing

839
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,399
and lots of our customers have really

840
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,240
enjoyed it

841
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,839
but we have had one request over and

842
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,719
over

843
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,159
and over again

844
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,918
so lots and lots of our

845
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,879
men and women in uniform in the military

846
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,520
you know they do this kind of emergency

847
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,320
incident response where they have to get

848
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,918
on a plane and they have to fly to the

849
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,560
other side of the globe and they have to

850
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,639
hook up to a network start monitoring

851
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,639
traffic and do some emergency incident

852
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,560
response

853
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
it's not the easiest thing in the world

854
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,760
to take a 1u or 2u box and try to cram

855
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,239
it into an overhead compartment can we

856
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,520
agree on that

857
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,520
it's a little sub-optimal right

858
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
so

859
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,960
what we are officially announcing today

860
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,239
is

861
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,560
security onion solutions

862
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,320
response ready appliances

863
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,880
did i say it right how about that do you

864
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,480
want to see them

865
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,200
they want to see you

866
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,200
are you ready i don't know if you're

867
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,520
ready

868
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,079
okay

869
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,560
so ladies and gentlemen i present to you

870
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,920
security onion solutions

871
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,000
go now

872
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,079
go fast

873
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,720
and go big all right

874
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
so we start with the go now this is the

875
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,960
little guy okay

876
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,680
so when you gotta go now you gotta go

877
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,760
now just pick the little guy up throw in

878
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,119
a backpack and go

879
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,160
right

880
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,560
so that's the go now

881
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
very small very portable uh very

882
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,440
powerful for such a small form factor

883
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,520
right it's got a xeon processor

884
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,440
64 gigs of ram

885
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,800
two different nick options

886
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
16 terabytes of nvme see i don't know

887
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,800
all these specs off the top of my head

888
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,320
mike's got our hardware on lockdown man

889
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,480
so that's the go now pretty spiffy

890
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
little box

891
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,040
next up is the go fast so if you want to

892
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,359
really go fast and handle more traffic

893
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,839
than the go now can handle you want to

894
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,480
go fast all right so

895
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,920
this is essentially like a dell 6515

896
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,800
with

897
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,400
some really nice amd epic processors

898
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,800
lots of ram lots of storage that's been

899
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,960
folded in half

900
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,640
into this custom form factor that will

901
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,960
fit in an overhead compartment

902
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,200
right it's pretty slick

903
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,839
so that's to go fast

904
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,200
then we have

905
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,800
the beast

906
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,640
the go big

907
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,760
this is the absolute top of the line box

908
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
every conceivable option

909
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,000
again folded in half to fit in an

910
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
overhead compartment comes in a nice

911
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,800
kind of roller bag right so easily

912
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,200
portable

913
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,520
that's some other pictures of kind of

914
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,359
the insides when you kind of crack that

915
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,680
case the beast is just waiting to come

916
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,560
out

917
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,880
right

918
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,000
so that's our sos response ready kits

919
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,800
the go now the go big and the go fast

920
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
these are available as

921
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,599
kits which includes not only the box

922
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,359
itself but also

923
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,960
