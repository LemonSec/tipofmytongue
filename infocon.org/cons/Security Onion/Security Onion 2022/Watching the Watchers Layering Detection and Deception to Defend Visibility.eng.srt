1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,099
without further Ado I would like to

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,099
introduce our first Speaker we refer to

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,340
him affectionately as Lambo because this

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,380
dude is super high speed

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,480
so ladies and Gentlemen please join me

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,260
in welcoming Mr Wes Lambert all right

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,599
good morning everybody hopefully you got

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,600
some some good breakfast some coffee and

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,219
they're ready for some good security and

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,700
in content again I am Wes Lambert also

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,399
known as Lambo and this presentation is

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,620
called watching the Watchers and let me

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,620
actually put it on the screen here so uh

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,879
today we're going to talk a little bit

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,180
about how we can work to defend our

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,980
visibility uh being that our

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,680
divisibility visibility as security and

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,480
then just thinking about ways that we

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,940
can protect our grid and you know ensure

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,379
its proper operation and that kind of

21
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,820
thing

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,339
so you know just talking in the vein of

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,900
visibility

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,880
um you know just thinking kind of the

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,680
basic level uh when we think about

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,420
visibility really just thinking about

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,860
you know just being able to see in

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,180
general right just having an

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,840
unobstructed view right just like this

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,740
kind yep

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,700
should be on yep

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,979
all right just like this uh gentleman Ed

33
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,299
Bassmaster here looking at this

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,100
beautiful vehicle right he's got an

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,400
unobstructed view uh into this this

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,799
beautiful thing right here so

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,840
um visibility you know when we think

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,060
about it right enables our defense right

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,619
being able to see

40
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,259
being able to understand what's going on

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,960
in our Network being able to understand

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,060
the type of communication right things

43
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,759
that are going on without having that

44
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,799
visibility

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,240
do we know if there are attackers in our

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,280
networks do we know if there are you

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,320
know if we're you know undergoing

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,479
anything like that where are they right

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,460
I mean we don't know without visibility

50
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,500
we have to have that to be able to

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,700
understand what's going on in the

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,020
network in the first place let alone

53
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,038
understand if anything bad is happening

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,620
so in the case of security engine the

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,200
primary Watchers you would say or maybe

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,720
our visibility that we have are going to

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,459
be that of you know beats right we're

58
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,319
talking about the host data we might be

59
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,360
shipping logs or collecting logs from an

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
application using filebeat or Windows

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,280
event logs with Winlock beat similarly

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
with OS query uh with Playbook we have

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
visibility into some characteristics of

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,140
those logs right we have detections we

65
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,940
have ways to look for abnormal activity

66
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,860
we have that kind of visibility with

67
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,720
stenographer we have you know full

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,280
packet capture right we're able to see

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,620
kind of the full conversation and that

70
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,900
kind of thing stralco we have files

71
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,940
right we we're looking at certain

72
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,739
characteristics or metadata of the files

73
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,819
and we're able to make certain

74
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,920
determinations on files that are

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,840
extracted from the network we have that

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
kind of visibility and then with

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,920
surakata and Zeke surakata we have that

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,900
metadata right and we have the nids

79
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,640
capability the same with Zeke we have

80
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,400
metadata about this uh this thing going

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,959
on in our Network

82
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,580
had that type of visibility

83
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,680
and this is just a diagram you yeah it's

84
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,739
not too bad but again showing just at

85
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,120
the network level you know our certain

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
visibility that we have there the host

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,239
level the visibility that we have there

88
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,860
and then kind of going from there going

89
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,540
into some characteristics of those files

90
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,000
with stroka and Yara and then also being

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
able to later hunt and stack on that

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,680
data having a central repository and

93
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,659
having a way to look at that data and

94
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,540
you know either through hunting or

95
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,720
stacking or alerting having a particular

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,319
form of visibility into our Network

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
right so that's Defenders that's very

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,819
important to be able to understand at

99
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,620
these various levels things that are

100
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,599
going on and to be able to analyze them

101
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,260
appropriately

102
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,319
now when we talk about visibility and we

103
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,519
talk about you know all of these things

104
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,099
that we have at our disposal how do we

105
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,099
defend against attackers potentially

106
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,200
affecting that visibility in one way or

107
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
another we'll talk about this a little

108
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,439
bit in the talk

109
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,879
um a little you know some preventive

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,858
measures you can take kind of some basic

111
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,019
measures some monitoring and some other

112
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,639
things that you can do to look at this

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,320
or address this

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,840
but again you know it's like how long

115
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
would it take before we actually

116
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,320
realized our visibility was impacted

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,259
right would we know if something changed

118
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:33,900
what we know if you know an attacker was

119
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,060
doing something bad to affect our our

120
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,100
visibility

121
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,199
uh we really need to be able to detect

122
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,360
that and respond to that potentially you

123
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,000
know redirect some of that activity

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,259
maybe guide the attacker towards a

125
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,400
certain path

126
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,380
and increase the overall cost right like

127
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,740
make it just not really feasible or not

128
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,780
amenable right I mean that's that's the

129
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,440
main goal right

130
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,080
so some basic practices again this is

131
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,240
not an exhaustive list this is not you

132
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,919
know I'm not talking about sticking your

133
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,680
boxes or doing anything like that but

134
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,660
some very basic practices we can do

135
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,240
right the first one being turn on MFA

136
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,120
for sock since I think since last

137
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,520
Security on security engine conference

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,580
we do have MFA available for the analyst

139
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,380
login right so if you're logging into

140
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,740
security engine console please do enable

141
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,600
MFA

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
and only allow access to Ports as

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,280
necessary right I think this is kind of

144
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,600
a basic one you know this is always

145
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
preached right least privileged kind of

146
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,560
thing but you know it's very important

147
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,780
that you're not just opening up uh you

148
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,699
know a huge subnet or

149
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,919
um you know quad zero or whatever

150
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,060
um

151
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,000
use SSH Keys you know I know a lot some

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,860
people do this I don't think the

153
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,100
majority do though SSH keys are great

154
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,259
you know as an alternative form of

155
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,940
authentication right instead of just a

156
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,320
username and password since you would

157
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,259
you would need that to authenticate

158
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,199
and a really important one that we try

159
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,240
to really drill into folks is not

160
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,639
exposing the security engine node to the

161
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,979
internet unless it is required by the

162
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,979
role right certainly not a manager right

163
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,259
we don't want to have uh you know all of

164
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,639
that capability and all that visibility

165
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,860
potentially be impacted you know so

166
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,479
easily or

167
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,979
um you know from such a broad attack

168
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,758
surface right

169
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,380
so we also talk about detection

170
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,020
right so detection is usually

171
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,539
implemented as a set of rules whether it

172
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,240
be his rules like you know a sec or

173
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,039
something similar or Ned's rules like

174
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,960
cirocata right where you would write

175
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,060
snort rules that kind of thing or Sigma

176
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,639
or Yara or even Zeke scripts these are

177
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,160
all forms of looking at the data and

178
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,319
detecting if something is amiss right

179
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,940
based on that rule

180
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,240
so that is another way to protect this

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,280
visibility right to alert us of

182
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,440
something bad right

183
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,539
but what about things like configuration

184
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,539
failures right

185
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,199
if you don't hear anything bad happening

186
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,560
is anything bad happening would you know

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,440
would you know if an analyst or an

188
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,039
engineer put in a rule or you know typed

189
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,500
in mistyped some yaml and then you know

190
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,060
the service is now not functioning

191
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,039
you're no longer logging data or you're

192
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,460
no longer you know seeing those alerts

193
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,139
would you know

194
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,780
so it's very important to consider using

195
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,639
things like Version Control right like

196
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,919
maybe get or something similar for

197
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,780
certain configuration files and and

198
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,880
really have you know some process in

199
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,560
place to be able to monitor those things

200
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,419
whether it be looking at the local

201
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,539
system logs for potential errors or just

202
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,280
again having that Version Control it's

203
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,800
very important to be aware that these

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,479
are some things that could definitely be

205
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,099
impactful to your visibility

206
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,759
and I think you know these are these are

207
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,740
often overlooked I think or people don't

208
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,240
think about it until it's too late and

209
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,400
it's already happening right and maybe

210
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,199
not even from a malicious perspective

211
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,120
but just from you know everyday

212
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,580
management you know we see this a lot uh

213
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,020
with with you know support and

214
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,259
Professional Services type things where

215
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,660
people might have mistyped something or

216
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,599
you know put a rule in that was maybe a

217
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,879
little too verbose right so it could

218
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,900
definitely be impactful

219
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,520
aside from that I'm sure we've all had

220
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,380
service failures before

221
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,599
particular Services you know maybe like

222
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,899
uh you know the niz service or uh you

223
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,060
know that host based data maybe

224
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,800
something fails and you don't hear about

225
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,480
it did it really fail

226
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,000
yes it failed right and now you're not

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,300
getting data your visibility is impacted

228
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,339
these are things that we need to monitor

229
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,519
for to protect that visibility I mean

230
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
these might seem basic but you know I

231
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,940
think time and time again you know folks

232
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,060
should be reminded or can be reminded of

233
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,620
things like this that can be very simple

234
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,080
right being able to monitor for these

235
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
types of activities and we can do this

236
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,279
with things like grafana or Playbook

237
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,500
right there's lots of ways that we can

238
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,800
do this

239
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,440
Upstream failures

240
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,660
are going to be another thing

241
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,820
right so Upstream failures can

242
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,160
absolutely impact visibility when I talk

243
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,440
about that I mean like the Nick right if

244
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
you have a bad Nick or if your Nick just

245
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
can't handle the load right

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,560
you might have no packets you have

247
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,120
packet loss you might have all sorts of

248
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,100
weird stuff going on

249
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,040
same thing with cabling even span ports

250
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,440
and Taps right I mean how many times has

251
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,480
anyone ever run into an issue where the

252
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,399
network team suddenly there's a new

253
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,440
segment or you know there's no segment

254
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,660
left on the on the span

255
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,459
right anybody had that happen

256
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,100
or attack yep yep

257
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,440
okay it's definitely a possibility and

258
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,459
something that you should be thinking

259
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,740
about because you know you don't want to

260
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,480
be getting into an incident and trying

261
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,720
to investigate and realizing that you're

262
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,800
not getting what you thought you were

263
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,920
getting

264
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,420
the same thing with running security and

265
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,100
in order just security tools in the

266
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,480
cloud in general right if you're

267
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,760
performing a VPC mirroring or you're

268
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,620
looking at other data Cloud security

269
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,440
groups right this is kind of firewall

270
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,240
changes if you're not letting the

271
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,399
mirrored traffic through appropriately

272
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,380
could be missing stuff it might not be

273
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,839
getting what you think you're getting

274
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,700
so these are all impactful to our

275
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,540
visibility overall

276
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,820
so here's an example a very simple

277
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,220
example this is something that you can

278
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,920
use in Playbook this is something that

279
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,420
Zeke already generates it's a very

280
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,779
simple kind of way to monitor the

281
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,600
traffic for Zeke and we actually have an

282
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,579
accompanying video for grafana as well

283
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,880
on YouTube but this just looks at the

284
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,820
Zeke notice logs and by default the

285
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,440
capture law script for Zeke will tell

286
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,000
you if there's no traffic or very little

287
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,459
traffic on an interface this is just a

288
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,320
very simple way to take that notice and

289
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,200
bubble it up to an actual alert right so

290
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,120
that now it's in the console we have

291
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,100
more eyes on it right we might not be

292
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,779
looking at the Z notices every day we

293
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,660
might not even know they exist

294
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,820
this is a way to get ahead of that and

295
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,320
you know protect your visibility

296
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,040
and here is an example is that rule

297
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,740
fires we do have an alert generated in

298
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,360
security and in console in the alerts

299
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,320
pane

300
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,000
then we can see that there's something

301
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,620
wrong with our interface there you might

302
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,060
want to go check that out

303
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,519
right and now we can do that maybe

304
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,779
within

305
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,940
you know an hour or two you know we

306
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,260
might have just seen the alert you know

307
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,279
we might have been to lunch or something

308
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,560
instead of having to run into a

309
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,720
situation where we're in an incident or

310
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,000
we're doing uh you know like a red seam

311
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,800
exercise or a pin test or something like

312
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
that and we get caught with our pants

313
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,100
now right I mean

314
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,440
nobody wants that to happen right so

315
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,420
protect our visibility we can do that

316
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,380
with things like this

317
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,079
aside from that we can also Implement

318
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,899
deception right

319
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,540
so we can have ways

320
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,860
to make something appear

321
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,880
that is not

322
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,440
right

323
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,000
we might want to lure or confuse

324
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,399
increase the cost to the adversary right

325
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,959
we want to make it more difficult we

326
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,120
want to you know at least make them work

327
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,820
for it right or be scared and run off

328
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,019
so we're going to put poor little honey

329
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,560
on it Bay

330
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,019
all right

331
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,579
I'm gonna put some honey on it and the

332
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:48,839
first thing that we're going to do is

333
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,339
we're going to talk about honey crittent

334
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,399
yeah honey credentials okay or

335
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,160
honeycreds right

336
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,560
so if you're not aware of hunting

337
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,639
credentials

338
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,860
um you know typically it's just a set of

339
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,360
fake credentials

340
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,940
I suppose it could be legitimate right

341
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,220
in some instance but disabled but the

342
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,560
main goal is to alert

343
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,120
whenever these credentials are used

344
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,860
right because these should not be used

345
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,380
by a regular user should not be used

346
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,420
under normal conditions

347
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,100
typically we would want to spread these

348
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,320
through routes you know the environment

349
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
in places where we think an attacker or

350
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,459
an adversary might pick them up and try

351
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,680
to use them things were you know places

352
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,060
where we might think they might pillage

353
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,220
and go look for fun stuff

354
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,920
now this can be injected into memory in

355
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,440
this case we are just looking at really

356
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,180
just placing a file on a network share

357
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,180
or on a workstation or a server

358
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,220
right and these can also be SSH keys

359
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,019
right or tokens so it doesn't

360
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,220
necessarily have to be a username and

361
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,000
password combination

362
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,399
so here's an example of running

363
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,500
credentials right here so the attacker

364
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,940
might gain access to an employee

365
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,220
workstation finds the honey credentials

366
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,720
you know kind of rooting around on an

367
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
attached Network share or something like

368
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,000
that

369
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,820
and then they attempt to log in to the

370
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,320
Target device you know maybe that

371
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,180
they're assumed the credentials are used

372
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,880
for or otherwise and an alarm is

373
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,440
generated right

374
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,700
well at least that's the intention

375
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,380
because an alarm is generated to an

376
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,480
external system we're notified we're

377
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,940
able to investigate and we know

378
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,579
at that point in time that you know

379
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,560
that the adversary could have been at

380
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,060
least here right where these credentials

381
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,200
were stored

382
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,700
we're able to track that activity at

383
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,480
least

384
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,339
and we're made aware of their presence

385
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,579
right

386
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,940
so again one way we might do that is by

387
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,560
dropping a file including fake

388
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,120
credentials in this case

389
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,100
maybe something to like a security

390
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,800
ending console or something like that or

391
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,959
maybe a dummy security and in console I

392
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,880
don't know what

393
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,860
um that's one way to do this right so

394
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,240
we've got the username and password in

395
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,100
there and we've got an IP address to

396
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,720
where an attacker you know might give

397
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,740
them a little hint where to go

398
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,260
and something we can do to detect this

399
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,420
kind of activity is

400
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,760
create a play Within Playbook

401
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,000
right so we create this play

402
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,519
and what we're looking for is just from

403
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,459
the Kratos logs here Kratos is our

404
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,560
identity provider for security engine it

405
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,839
helps with our identity operations

406
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,220
and we're looking at these particular

407
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,860
types of audit logs to see if this

408
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,180
username

409
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,399
and not even the password really the

410
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,459
just the username has been attempted to

411
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,800
log in with right

412
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,360
and the great thing here is that we

413
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,339
don't even have to create an account in

414
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,199
Kratos or anything like that

415
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,839
we can just you know rent throw a random

416
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,760
name at it and the log will generate

417
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,320
this message

418
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,880
and we'll be able to tell that someone

419
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,459
has attempted to use these credentials

420
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,560
it won't work of course

421
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,959
but we will be alerted to the presence

422
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,420
of the attacker right

423
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,220
we'll see that directly in security and

424
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,139
in console because of that play it's

425
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,699
going to generate that a last alert Rule

426
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,139
and it's going to run and it's going to

427
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,699
see

428
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,220
that from Kratos

429
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,079
we're able to identify that those

430
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,859
credentials were used

431
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,940
and then we can go off in that

432
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,620
particular direction as I mentioned

433
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,899
where we think uh or where we place them

434
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:19,860
right

435
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,699
and go from there

436
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,800
similarly we can leverage intrusion

437
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,899
detection honey pots

438
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,060
Chris Sanders and Josh Brauer talked

439
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,680
about this at the last security and

440
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,940
Conference they had an excellent

441
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,560
presentation about

442
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,920
idh and about using it for deception

443
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,959
right and detection

444
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,300
so

445
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,160
the real purpose you know for these

446
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,139
honey pots are really to mimic that

447
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,660
legitimate system right and typically

448
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,980
these are going to be placed inside the

449
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,040
network alongside similar assets right

450
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,320
because you don't want to look so out of

451
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,699
the ordinary that it's completely

452
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,160
ridiculous from the attacker perspective

453
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,440
you want to blend in somewhat

454
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
and typically this is going to be you

455
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,500
know it's going to be a low to medium

456
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,119
interaction Honeypot right they're not

457
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,260
really going to do much on this they're

458
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,740
not going to be necessarily logging in

459
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,059
we want to use this for detection

460
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,500
purposes right so you have to even

461
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,900
accessed it or tried to log in and the

462
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,119
main thing is that this honey pot is

463
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,299
monitored right we're actually

464
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:22,980
monitoring the activity we're not

465
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,319
collecting data and going back and

466
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,780
reviewing it it's actually monitored and

467
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,460
then you know it bubbles up to us the

468
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,480
analyst

469
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,040
and we're able to review that quickly

470
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,559
so I'm going to talk about the idh node

471
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,240
a little bit it was presented again at

472
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,280
the last security and Conference it's

473
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,740
now cleanly integrated into into

474
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,299
security editing

475
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,160
so you can just run through setup add

476
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,720
that idh node

477
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,660
and you're ready to go

478
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,760
right so you just connect that connect

479
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,020
the node and start attracting

480
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,059
adversaries and then we alert on their

481
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,160
presence and make them cry right because

482
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,860
that's what we do with security onion

483
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,360
so let's talk about a variant of the idh

484
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,179
node about the security engine decoy

485
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,120
node would you like to deploy

486
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,039
a decoy security Union instance

487
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,080
something that looks and smells like a

488
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,220
security onion

489
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,020
what is it

490
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,080
we can confuse attackers right maybe

491
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,720
they think they're attacking the actual

492
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,000
Security in an instance

493
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,740
an actual security and manager

494
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,220
by doing this we can redirect that

495
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,200
activity right based on the intent of

496
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,760
the adversary I mean they may reverse

497
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,860
course they may Retreat altogether but

498
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,960
they may probe further still

499
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,880
either way we've already turned the

500
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,900
lights on

501
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,860
right we've already

502
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,640
you know lit up the scene right

503
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,520
so here we go here's an example just a

504
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,039
very very simple the attacker

505
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,200
connects to the security engine decoy

506
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,000
and hey what's up

507
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,200
we got you bruh

508
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,400
all right

509
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,220
for real though

510
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,140
it looks like a legitimate security

511
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,460
ending console

512
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,100
but it's not

513
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,559
right we can leverage this to our

514
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,900
advantage thinking you know routing the

515
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,700
attacker or you know

516
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,860
influencing their perception and their

517
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,699
actions in this way

518
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,419
now

519
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,880
this is a custom open Canary skin based

520
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,340
on the idh Node work that Josh put

521
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,740
together in Chris together collaborate

522
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,240
on and

523
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,340
you can see here we've just got just

524
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,000
some basic ammo config this is again a

525
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,039
custom template and everything that I

526
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,840
will probably be releasing a link to

527
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,179
later but uh it's fairly straightforward

528
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,799
this is just an example of how you might

529
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,600
might modify that in the pillar for any

530
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,918
open Canary config in general

531
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,340
and then with the idh node there are

532
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,320
plays enabled when we install the idh

533
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,440
node so for things like what SSH HTTP

534
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,480
MySQL write all the various Services we

535
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,980
have play is automatically enabled so

536
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,380
that means that we have detections ready

537
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,120
to go once it's added

538
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,440
and what that means is that

539
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,020
you can see we have this Playbook rule

540
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,460
here

541
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,620
so with this

542
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,780
we'll get an alert whenever the HTTP

543
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,480
server or the security engine decoy is

544
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,080
accessed

545
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,539
similarly

546
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,480
we'll get an alert whenever the HTTP

547
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,520
login you know whenever they attempt to

548
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,980
log into the server you'll more than

549
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,320
likely get the access before the login

550
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,880
obviously since they're going to be

551
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,460
hitting that but either way

552
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,140
you're turning the lights on right

553
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,520
you're tipping the

554
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,000
the advantage to your side right

555
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,700
the attacker is likely unaware that this

556
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,799
is not a legitimate Security in a node

557
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,660
they may keep trying you know they they

558
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,100
might want to tap into that visibility

559
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,559
that we're trying to protect

560
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,160
so

561
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,200
we can see an alert here now from The

562
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
Playbook rules we'll see we've got an

563
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,640
HTTP access from

564
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,980
the attacker at the security and decoy

565
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,659
node and we can get some other different

566
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,520
details there such as the source IP

567
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,679
right we'll be able to see which

568
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,360
particular IP address which internal

569
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,500
device

570
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,159
the attacker was connecting from

571
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,880
it's pretty nice

572
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,440
but aside from that

573
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,000
let's talk about

574
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,580
another strategy we can use or another

575
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,900
tool

576
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,100
that's honey commands

577
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,059
so what a honey command is it's an alias

578
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,700
or a wrapper around actual legitimate

579
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,840
commands

580
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,059
where we'll wrap in our own desired

581
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,340
activity into the actual execution of

582
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,480
the command

583
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,820
right and what this results in is the

584
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,640
attacker not necessarily experiencing

585
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,799
any difference in behavior from their

586
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,659
perspective

587
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,179
so if they're trying to pillage a server

588
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,340
or they're trying to do some Recon right

589
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,539
and trying to figure out where to go if

590
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,400
they're trying to Pivot and they're

591
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,720
trying to pull some tools down

592
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,120
this is a great way to alert us of that

593
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,880
and really this can be and this could be

594
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,620
implemented on a security ending node

595
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,080
where if you're concerned that you know

596
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,640
it's kind of the last hop in the box has

597
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,740
actually been accessed

598
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,500
I mean this could be a way to alert on

599
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,880
that right

600
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,900
among other things

601
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,159
so here's an example of an attacker

602
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,380
gaining access to the server

603
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,360
and what we have here is the attacker

604
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,580
trying to pull down or just you know

605
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,980
call in attackertools.com I think I

606
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,140
missed the URI on that one

607
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,640
um but we can see that wget is aliased

608
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,299
two

609
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,159
not just wget right

610
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,400
it's aliased to a curl command

611
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,380
and what this could be this could be

612
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,240
some internal web hook

613
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,760
this could be some external service

614
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,799
right it could be a lot of things and

615
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,200
then we're redirecting the output

616
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,720
to devno right so or you know we're

617
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,940
suppressing that basically so

618
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,559
we're running the wget command after

619
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,240
that along with any other parameters

620
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,620
that the attacker wants to run

621
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,299
and here's an example

622
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,340
if we wanted to send that to slack right

623
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,280
an out-of-band notification

624
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,900
might not want to send it to our

625
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,340
security engine console if it's

626
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,380
potentially impacted if our visibility

627
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,240
could potentially be impacted

628
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,940
and for persistence for us if we wanted

629
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,460
to actually add this for a single user

630
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,260
we could add it to the bash RC for the

631
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,820
for the particular user or we could add

632
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,960
it to

633
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,659
Etsy profile.d right for all users just

634
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,940
depending on what particular commands

635
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,580
that we choose might be you know

636
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,780
appropriate for that

637
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,299
here's just a general overview of the

638
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,400
slack payload that we might send this is

639
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,020
just the alert that gets generated in

640
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,179
Slack right you can see that I've just

641
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:37,559
added it to the general Channel there

642
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,200
just specified honey alert is kind of

643
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,659
the as a username

644
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:44,100
and then specified some other details

645
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,200
right with the the wget we're just

646
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,700
referencing that that command was run

647
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,679
that's why this is being triggered

648
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,059
someone is logged into the security

649
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,340
engine server then we're also just doing

650
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,080
a quick who am I to actually see who ran

651
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,120
the command right which user is the

652
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,679
attacker running as

653
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,720
and then again on which actual host

654
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,580
right if we have multiple boxes we might

655
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,440
want to know that

656
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,120
and then a cool emoji

657
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,419
so

658
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,640
we run the command

659
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,559
um you know it's I'm sorry the attacker

660
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,120
runs the command right pulls down the

661
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,460
evil tools zip

662
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,500
looks no different it's there right it

663
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,760
works it's fine

664
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,000
but then

665
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,720
we receive a slight notification

666
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
right so the attacker

667
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,279
has gone and done you know what what

668
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,260
they're doing they're doing their thing

669
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,179
unbeknownst to them we know they're

670
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,980
doing their thing right

671
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,840
so we are aware

672
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,880
it's probably pretty critical pretty uh

673
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,380
you know probably got hair standing up

674
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,279
right now

675
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,900
but

676
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,640
it's another way

677
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,039
to have a last stand at protecting your

678
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,059
visibility

679
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,860
right

680
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,740
not necessarily alerting to the current

681
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,679
system but externally

682
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,000
because you may not be able to

683
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:08,940
so

684
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,940
in summary this is just a quick overview

685
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,380
you know this is not intended to be

686
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,179
wholly accurate but just some examples

687
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,400
of the degree of impact of our

688
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,020
visibility right

689
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,640
for example starting with those config

690
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,940
failures all the way down to host access

691
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,860
and some things we might monitor for or

692
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,320
use for monitoring

693
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,960
well as some of the other honey things

694
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,779
on the side that we might want to do or

695
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,340
use to attract

696
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,080
and alert-upon

697
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,440
to protect our visibility right protect

698
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,940
our infrastructure

699
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,760
redirect them in a particular direction

700
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,360
so in summary

701
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,100
we just need to be aware of the failure

702
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,900
paths and the attack paths for our

703
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,020
visibility infrastructure right we need

704
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,860
to be thinking about that because

705
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,299
it'll be too late when you're not right

706
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,400
it might be too late

707
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,140
so we want to instrument those deception

708
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,140
and detections whenever I'm sorry where

709
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,460
ever able

710
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,460
and again as always increase the cost to

711
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,480
the adversary right

712
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,880
that is all that I have

713
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,420
thank you all

714
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:30,840
[Applause]

715
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,860
any questions

716
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,659
yep

717
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,380
hardly ever since

718
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,980
Maybe

719
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,459
right

720
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,900
right

721
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,779
yeah I think

722
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,940
it just depends right I mean trying to

723
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,860
build a baseline of what's normal for

724
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,260
that and and trying to really hone in on

725
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,840
on kind of the variability there I think

726
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,860
it's probably going to be the best bet

727
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,419
and then you know obviously like the

728
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,039
service monitoring and configuration

729
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,140
monitoring and stuff like that might be

730
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,100
important

731
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,240
um and then again you can always

732
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,039
Leverage The you know the honey stuff as

733
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,900
kind of a last stand kind of thing on

734
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,159
the box itself right so

735
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,200
like you know

736
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,020
right so grafana is a great way to look

737
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,220
at that right so you can see the

738
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,779
historical average and you can see

739
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,240
between certain time points and kind of

740
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,020
a sampling of that data yep

741
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,679
anyone else

742
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,720
all right

743
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,260
yep

744
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,760
yeah just just not really exposing like

745
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,260
any of that really directly to the

746
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,240
internet right you don't want SSH or or

747
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,580
any of that directly accessible

748
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,559
right you want to focus on maybe like a

749
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,299
VPN solution or something like that

750
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,679
anyone else

751
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,260
yep

752
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,140
right so uh I myself right so just just

753
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,880
kind of personal development that kind

754
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,159
of thing but yeah but I think you know

755
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,440
from you know Chris and and Josh have

756
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,360
kind of done a great job explaining um I

757
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,500
know Chris has done a lot of research

758
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,179
with the low interaction honeypots right

759
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,159
and that kind of thing

760
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,100
um but I myself have not necessarily

761
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,580
yeah yeah yeah

762
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,299
no it'd be it'd be great to see some

763
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,860
actual like statistics or you know on

764
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,120
how that's being used if that can be

765
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,479
shared

766
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,899
anyone else

767
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,410
all right well thank you guys

768
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,890
[Applause]
