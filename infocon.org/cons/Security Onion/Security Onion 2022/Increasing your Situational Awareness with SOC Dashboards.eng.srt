00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,160
morning thank you Phil and Doug and

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,779
Karen and the rest of the team who has

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,119
put together this conference uh good

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,820
talk so far and the best part yet to

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,680
come no I'm not talking about Doug's

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,019
talk talk about lunch in just a little

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,539
bit okay so we got my talk and then

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,640
we're gonna do lunch and I'll try to

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,100
keep keep it short so we can get to

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,380
lunch here so my name is Josh Brauer

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,140
I've been in I.T for a little under 20

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,620
years security just under 15 years the

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,079
vast majority of my career has been in

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,420
the international non-profit space for

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,539
about 15 years really focused on network

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,180
and endpoint detection as well as

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,879
training our staff around the world how

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,039
the things that they do and say in the

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,379
digital world impact their you know real

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,960
life physical safety situation we'll

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,640
talk about that more in just a second

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,340
you can catch me on Twitter at defensive

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,100
depth I did join security Union

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,560
Solutions about three years ago I focus

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,560
now on engineering of the platform as

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,119
well as training

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,740
so this morning we're going to be

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,080
talking about situational awareness with

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,439
dashboards and as Phil already mentioned

32
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,880
dashboards in this context talking about

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,759
these security ending console dashboards

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,799
component has anybody used that

35
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,840
component yet

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,299
a few all right I'm glad our team has

37
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,520
all right so

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,079
um I'm going to give you a little bit of

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,640
context though the first part of this

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,460
talk is going to be on context around

41
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,780
situational awareness and what that

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,299
looks like in the Cyber or the digital

43
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,740
realm and then we'll talk about what

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,920
that looks like more inside of security

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,259
onion using dashboards

46
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,220
so um in my uh in my past I had the

47
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,560
great privilege of working very closely

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,799
with uh the physical security and safety

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,680
teams of the organizations I worked with

50
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,940
we had people around the world in many

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,979
different locations and some not so

52
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,920
great locations and I really appreciated

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,080
that the physical safety teams really

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,560
understood the the concept of you know

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,720
how the things that we say and do and

56
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,420
what we do in the digital realm impacts

57
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,599
real life for instance you know writing

58
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,819
certain things on social media when

59
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,379
you're living or staying in a country

60
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,599
that doesn't have the same level of

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,060
freedom of speech as the U.S right can

62
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,300
even as a foreigner can bring personal

63
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,940
safety issues to you and so in working

64
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,379
through that and working with the

65
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,200
physical Safety and Security people I

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
really appreciated how a lot of the

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,800
concepts in physical security really

68
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,980
carry over to some extent in digital or

69
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,920
cyber security I want to mention just a

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,620
couple of those off the top there we go

71
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,000
physical and digital security does

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,580
anybody know what this little device is

73
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,000
right here

74
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,260
if you can see that very easily

75
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,640
it's a wedge

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,040
yeah door stop alarm thanks Chris

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,319
all right so door stop alarm right so

78
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,800
you are this I picked up from traveling

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,780
with the physical safety guys to some

80
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,840
certain locations right so we are at our

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,200
hotel our location at night and make

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,239
sure the doors are locked and for a

83
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,459
little bit of added protection we put

84
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,140
this device right underneath the door

85
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,480
and then if someone tries to force the

86
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,800
door open in the middle of the night

87
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,620
this depresses and 120 decibel alarm

88
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,300
goes off okay I'm not going to do it

89
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,400
right now it's Extremely Loud probably

90
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,620
will blow out the speakers we'll not do

91
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,720
that to you all

92
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,220
what is this

93
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,599
um

94
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,080
what would correlate to this concept in

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,620
cyber security

96
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,700
go ahead and yell out a little louder

97
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,280
okay coal mine I heard alerts detections

98
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,980
right so automated detections right this

99
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,019
is very very similar same concept we

100
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,480
have a mechanism we set in place we

101
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,400
Define parameters when those parameters

102
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,459
are fulfilled we generate an alarm or an

103
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,680
alert in this case it's an audible Alert

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,858
in our case we are actually generating

105
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,540
you know digital alerts whatever that

106
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,360
may look like we also have the concept

107
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,880
of threat hunting right

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,400
I think my pointer is having issues

109
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,740
there we go thread hunting

110
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,720
um and I should say when we talk about

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,479
physical security and my background I'm

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,580
not talking about military at all okay

113
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,560
I'm talking about physical safety

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
personal safety as well as corporate

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,699
security so not from a military

116
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,860
perspective so we talk about threat

117
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,120
hunting obviously we know what that

118
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,759
looks like in the Cyber realm from the

119
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,940
physical security side of things

120
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,979
I would like talk about that more from a

121
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,900
active sweeps right from a corporate

122
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,580
security I'm doing anti-surveillance

123
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,280
active sweeps personal safety I'm

124
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,520
looking for air tags depending on the

125
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,340
environment and what may be happening

126
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,000
looking for air Tags I'm looking for

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,880
hidden cameras at a Airbnb right things

128
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,680
like that we're doing targeted active

129
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,960
sweeps all right so that would be thread

130
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
hunting now we have this thing called

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,039
situational awareness has anybody heard

132
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,680
of the term situational awareness

133
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,300
all right so we're talking probably half

134
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,860
okay

135
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,100
if you Google uh situational awareness

136
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,440
you'll find lots of memes all right

137
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,440
lhasa memes like this

138
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,780
you got this come on

139
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,380
all right

140
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,220
it looks something like this right

141
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,620
situational awareness right so the uh

142
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,620
the people over here are looking for the

143
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,620
apex predator of the land they're hoping

144
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,360
to really get a glimpse of what's going

145
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,759
on and they have no idea that the apex

146
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,740
predator is actually watching them right

147
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,960
they don't they're not cognizant of

148
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,820
their surroundings they're not aware of

149
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,580
what's going on around them situational

150
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,479
awareness is also the idea that when I

151
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,820
am walking or I pay attention while

152
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,979
walking your Facebook status update can

153
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,560
wait right there's also physical safety

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,020
issue there when I'm walking I'm not I

155
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,520
mean I've seen a video even recently

156
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800
where this gentleman was walking and

157
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,020
looking at his phone and he walked right

158
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,819
like into a fountain and flipped right

159
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,440
into the fountain all right so just not

160
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,780
paying attention so at its core

161
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,419
situational awareness is

162
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,300
um being cognizant of your surroundings

163
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,819
and the change is happening and how that

164
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,060
can impact your Safety and Security all

165
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,580
right now we can Define from a mental

166
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,639
awareness perspective you know different

167
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,340
levels of situational awareness this one

168
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,400
is by Scott Stewart a friend of mine and

169
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,620
I'm not going to go into details but the

170
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,360
idea is that all the way from the bottom

171
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,880
you can be completely tuned out not

172
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,280
paying attention all the way to the Top

173
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,319
If you think about this from a driving

174
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,979
perspective two now you know we've my

175
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,660
first job in college okay I can't

176
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,880
believe this first job in college I was

177
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,039
driving school buses okay up in

178
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,460
Wisconsin and I remember you get so used

179
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,280
to your route that you just uh it's like

180
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,560
6 30 in the morning you just totally

181
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,360
tune out and all of a sudden you realize

182
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,280
I'm already at the school dropping off

183
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,660
the kids I don't even remember getting

184
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,060
there right I'm completely tuned now I'm

185
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,160
sorry for all the kids that you know

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,099
were in my school bus at the time but I

187
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,080
was completely tuned out right I was not

188
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,360
situationally aware the relaxed

189
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,340
awareness this is more defensive driving

190
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,460
okay focus awareness this is more when

191
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,880
I'm in a snowstorm or you know hurricane

192
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,520
or you know tropical force winds I've

193
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,500
got both hands on the steering wheel I'm

194
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,060
much more focused on what's going on

195
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,979
then obviously we keep going up from

196
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,580
there the idea is that as you go to

197
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,560
these higher levels there's a higher

198
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,960
level of stress and

199
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,960
um uh you need it's harder to maintain

200
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,840
it as you go along right it takes more

201
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,120
energy and so we're not talking about

202
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,900
being at focused or high alert all the

203
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,060
time it really depends on the context

204
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,940
and the situation and that that brings

205
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,039
us to one of my favorite quotes of all

206
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,680
time when we talk about cyber security

207
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,020
we talk about physical security we're

208
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,180
not talking about being paranoid at any

209
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,700
at any states okay

210
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,440
this is

211
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,479
going to put my clicker down

212
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,640
this is one of my favorite quotes

213
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,279
paranoia is the antithesis or the

214
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,219
opposite of security culture true

215
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,459
security culture requires a clear head a

216
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,040
rational mind and personal self-control

217
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,080
all right we're not talking about being

218
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,360
paranoid from a situational awareness

219
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,920
perspective we're not talking about

220
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,160
being paranoid even in cyber security if

221
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,620
you end up looking like that paranoid

222
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,839
guy you know showing all how it all

223
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,880
comes together it can be very difficult

224
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,540
to translate that to a business

225
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,580
perspective when you're talking to your

226
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,940
leadership instead security security is

227
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,500
a culture it's not a one-time thing

228
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,140
right it's a culture that you cultivate

229
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,160
over the years requires clear-headedness

230
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,779
rationality and yes personal

231
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,820
self-control to not you know say and do

232
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,040
stupid things on social media or in

233
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,480
front of a live audience things like

234
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,240
that all right any questions or comments

235
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,600
so far

236
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,300
okay so that is situational awareness

237
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,700
more from the perspective of of physical

238
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,120
Safety and Security mindset so how does

239
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,000
this apply in the digital or the Cyber

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,640
realm how should we Define situational

241
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,680
awareness and I this is just a working

242
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,080
definition it's not something that you

243
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,320
know I you know I'd fight you on okay

244
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,060
situational awareness events or changes

245
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,680
in the environment that shouldn't

246
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,620
generate alerts in and of themselves but

247
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,100
should still be monitored for contextual

248
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,200
perspective all right so the the

249
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
difference here is that when I'm

250
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,620
monitoring from a situational

251
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,019
perspective excuse me situational

252
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,060
awareness perspective I'm not going to

253
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,080
typically

254
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,500
always find malicious activity but I

255
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,540
will find and I've seen this over and

256
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,720
over I will find misconfigurations that

257
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,120
can lead to malicious activity happening

258
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,040
I will find proactively uh Shadow I.T

259
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,560
all right so if I can proactively

260
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,200
discover a shadow I.T happening in my

261
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,519
environment if you're not familiar with

262
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,279
the term Shadow I.T Shadow I.T is that

263
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,860
is the idea that elements of your

264
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,980
organization are going around the normal

265
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,079
I.T processes and doing their own thing

266
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,240
and there may be legit reasons for that

267
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,820
maybe it is you know blocking what

268
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,680
they're trying to do it may be because

269
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,320
there's security concerns but from a

270
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,940
security perspective we want to

271
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,459
proactively discover that so that we can

272
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,220
come alongside them and work through the

273
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,140
security concerns of what they're doing

274
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,660
so if I can proactively discover Shadow

275
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,660
I.T misconfigurations that helps us

276
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,420
greatly in our monitoring

277
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,940
now the key piece here is that we're

278
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,220
talking about changes we're really

279
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,360
talking about

280
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,399
um if you think about your environment

281
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,459
as a whole and we're monitoring it uh I

282
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:30,660
don't necessarily want to use the word

283
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,480
Baseline but it's more about following

284
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,360
the you know the diffs and reviewing the

285
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,980
Deltas of those diffs of looking at

286
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,899
what's going on your environment and

287
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,100
it's not that I'm necessarily looking

288
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,899
for something malicious that's kind of

289
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,279
the key that I'm trying to make it's

290
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,279
more about getting being aware of what's

291
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
going on around you again it's the same

292
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
concept that we have in physical

293
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,060
security now this is not

294
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,519
um new in the industry okay but a lot of

295
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,740
times

296
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,440
we a lot of times we look at these

297
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,260
changes as just low level alerts these

298
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,140
are like informational alerts and they

299
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,959
we view them in the alert console which

300
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,579
I find to be very difficult when I'm

301
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,200
trying to explore this data because a

302
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,540
lot of the times this data is

303
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,800
unstructured and needs to be viewed more

304
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,140
in context and viewing that in the alert

305
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,480
console can be very difficult so that's

306
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,760
where I'm trying to make a distinction

307
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,360
now the sigma project Sigma is a rule

308
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,060
format just like with VR rules just like

309
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,220
we have snore and cerakata rules we have

310
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,880
Sigma rules this is from their Wiki and

311
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,260
you define a level for your rule and it

312
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,540
goes from information informational all

313
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,339
the way up to critical

314
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,200
when you have an informational role it's

315
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
rules that are intended for enrichment

316
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,420
of events and then low which is what I

317
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,880
wanted to point out here

318
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,480
so low is notable event but rarely an

319
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,760
incident okay low rated events can be

320
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,399
relevant in high numbers or in

321
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,440
combination with others immediate

322
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,300
reactions shouldn't be necessary but a

323
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,180
regular review is recommended so they

324
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,279
have the same concept here of what I'm

325
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,500
talking about it's just kind of viewed a

326
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,380
little bit differently you can even see

327
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,240
I think they have it right here yeah on

328
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,040
the very top it says while low and

329
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,260
medium events have an informative nature

330
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,779
high and critical are ones that should

331
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,120
actually generate actual alerts

332
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,820
so the distinction I'm making is when we

333
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,560
talk about situational awareness I'm not

334
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,940
talking about let's just generate a

335
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,100
bunch of low-level alerts wanting to

336
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,440
look at things a little bit differently

337
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,500
let's take this out of Theory and take

338
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,279
another step towards practicality

339
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,820
excuse me

340
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,220
any questions by the way

341
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,440
is it making sense so far

342
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,480
okay I heard a yes I got thumbs up let's

343
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,100
do it

344
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,019
all right so for example user management

345
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,540
cred operations create reads updates

346
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,339
deletes you know those types of

347
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,700
operations here's a list of operations

348
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,279
that you may find in an environment all

349
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,560
right

350
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,820
users in your environment whether it's

351
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,880
your SAS your SAS applications you know

352
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,820
active directory CRM application being

353
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,040
able to monitor the users in your

354
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,839
environment is really really important

355
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,720
when you look at this list

356
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,700
do you see any of these that you would

357
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,560
want a dedicated alert like you'd want

358
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
to know immediately all right we have

359
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,180
user added HR Group group created and

360
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,399
permission set for volunteers which

361
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,160
accesses public data user added to the

362
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,019
volunteer group user added domain admin

363
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,300
group retiring employees user disabled

364
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,560
any of these

365
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,660
you would want a dedicated alert

366
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,940
generated right away go ahead and

367
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,800
throw it out

368
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
yeah the D.A right use added user added

369
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
to the domain admin group I want to know

370
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,459
right away for something like that

371
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:59,719
anything else in here

372
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,279
yeah the the SQL service account

373
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,339
password change right so I would

374
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,220
personally I would want like user added

375
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,440
to a domain admin group and any service

376
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,060
accounts in my environment if there's

377
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,860
like password changes I'd want to know

378
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,079
about and I'd want alerts generated on

379
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,959
those these are added to HR Group you

380
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,399
know I think you can make a case either

381
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,380
way that you'd want a gener like a

382
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,880
dedicated alert generated for something

383
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,760
like that but all the rest of these we

384
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,620
don't want alerts generated right this

385
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,839
is just kind of normal activity so a

386
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,060
group was created permission set for

387
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,040
volunteer data which is really public

388
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,139
data it's really not something that I

389
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,480
necessarily want especially in a high

390
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,699
volume situation I don't want a bunch of

391
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,740
those alerts this is what I'm talking

392
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,959
about is is putting all of this into

393
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,480
more of a dashboard setting so that you

394
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,760
can review this type of data on a

395
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,800
regular basis but you know so that

396
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,899
doesn't rise to the to the level of

397
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,380
needing to review a dedicated alert now

398
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,360
you may be saying Josh I mean

399
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,760
that's a lot of data review I mean you

400
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,339
don't know my environment I have tons of

401
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,260
you know operations you know stuff

402
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,519
you're talking about right here that

403
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,899
happen every day that's just not

404
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,480
feasible and that's fine I'm saying take

405
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
what what I'm saying and make it

406
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,680
manageable for your environment the

407
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,000
point is to

408
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,720
increase visibility in a contextual not

409
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,940
not not necessarily targeted like domain

410
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,639
admin or user account password changes

411
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,740
it's more General

412
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,500
you'll find things like there was an

413
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,959
instance where I was monitoring this in

414
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,940
previous history where

415
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,800
um

416
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,259
there was there was an uh an outside

417
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,800
person that came in and was asked to um

418
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,139
to do what they were doing their yearly

419
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,120
audits I think was for financials or

420
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,800
something and

421
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,040
um so our finance guys gave them gave

422
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,660
this person their username and password

423
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,519
to log in as them so they could access

424
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,860
all that data but they needed additional

425
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,420
permissions or something it was

426
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,899
something happened it was

427
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,699
someone out of the ordinary but it

428
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,619
wouldn't have risen to the effect of

429
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,480
being able to generate a dedicated alert

430
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,819
and just by monitoring General activity

431
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,799
of what's going on and permissions being

432
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,199
added from an ad perspective we found

433
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,000
out that hey this is probably not the

434
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
best thing to be doing why don't we you

435
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,540
know give permissions a different way

436
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,640
again being able to have that just

437
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,819
broader context

438
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,059
side note inside security onion we can

439
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,460
use elastic beats and Os query to gain

440
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,559
visibility in all of this the elastic

441
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,840
beats whether it's through the modules

442
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,120
like win log beats whether it's from

443
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,840
bringing in data from like G Suite

444
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,580
there's lots of different modules that

445
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,620
we can we can use inside security Union

446
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,659
to bring in this type of data

447
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,500
let's talk about shooting and anybody

448
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,380
here familiar with Shodan

449
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,780
all right that's pretty good probably 70

450
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,440
percent anybody here used it or used it

451
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,660
on a regular basis

452
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:09,000
all right all right good so showdan is a

453
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,860
tool it's a service it's been around for

454
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,440
quite a while now Sheridan is a service

455
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,240
that goes out and scans public internet

456
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,820
uh I think that's like roughly once a

457
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,679
week and it generates a bunch of

458
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,480
metadata about everything it's found

459
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,120
drops it in a database and then lets you

460
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,940
as a user query that database all right

461
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,240
and Showdown is a great place if you do

462
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,000
a search on YouTube for Showdown you'll

463
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,440
find that the vast majority of the

464
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,080
videos are all about using showdan for

465
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,480
you know gaining information for pen

466
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,520
tests and things like that what I'm

467
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
talking about here is using that same

468
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,720
data but instead use it for situational

469
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,640
awareness okay use that same data that

470
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,400
people would use for pen testing bring

471
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,260
that into secure the union and use that

472
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,900
to better inform our defenses and the

473
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,059
changes in our environment that's what

474
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,299
we're going to do I've used showdan

475
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,460
three specific ways over the years I

476
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,500
want to show you how I did that and then

477
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,179
also show you how to bring that data

478
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,240
into security onion that sound good

479
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,500
all right

480
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,299
so first off

481
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,820
let's actually come over here to show

482
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,120
Dan

483
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,840
it's almost like I don't know how to use

484
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,799
a computer come on

485
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,700
you're right

486
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,460
there we go all right so here is the

487
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,460
interface to chardan I'm just going to

488
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,559
say I want to look up my IP address all

489
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,740
right so I'm going to say IP colon I'm

490
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,720
going to do

491
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,419
8.8.8.8 that is Google's public DNS

492
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,500
resolver

493
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,880
so we're going to pull that up sometimes

494
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,220
showing can take you know up to 10-15

495
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,620
seconds to pull up the data

496
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,840
I do have screenshots of all this just

497
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,918
in case it fails us

498
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,299
okay while it's doing that

499
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,000
um we do have filters so I just use the

500
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,160
IP filter you can see there's a filter

501
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,260
reference so you can when you query show

502
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,660
Dan you can say I only want you to show

503
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,799
me

504
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,840
um you know filter all the data based on

505
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,360
this whether it's IP whether it's HTTP

506
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,299
HTML which we'll see in just a second

507
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,799
Bitcoin IPS lots of different options

508
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,900
here

509
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,820
all right so we see

510
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,679
that we have a result for 8.8.8.8

511
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,080
we click on it we see some metadata

512
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,500
about it open ports all sorts of

513
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,480
information now this is a really key

514
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,539
thing to know about Showdown is that

515
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,160
what we're doing right now is completely

516
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,620
passive all right I am not connecting

517
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,539
and from a legal perspective this is

518
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,559
important I'm not connecting to

519
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,160
8.8.8.8 okay I'm simply querying showdan

520
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,020
and the data that it's currently resides

521
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,480
in their database now I could go and

522
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,039
click this little link right here and

523
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,380
that will directly connect me to that

524
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,900
link but how I'm showing you and what

525
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,280
we're going to do is we're only getting

526
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,780
that data from Showdown we're not doing

527
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,000
any kind of active scanning of anything

528
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,100
all right

529
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,959
so that's the first piece is

530
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,460
we're going to try this again here

531
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,220
so the first obvious piece is scanning

532
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,100
uh or queering should end for your

533
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,280
public IP space on a regular basis all

534
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,380
right and you can do that with like a

535
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,700
specific IP your net block or ASN this

536
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,860
has literally saved my bacon before all

537
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,200
right so we were

538
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,880
um I was the primary firewall

539
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,440
administrator for an organization years

540
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,740
ago and I was on vacation so the

541
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,679
secondary made some changes

542
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,299
um I'm sure it was fine everything was

543
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,340
fine then all of a sudden the latest

544
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,179
Showdown scan showed that somehow this

545
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,840
person had reversed the default deny and

546
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,000
made it default allow so all of our

547
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,179
publicly hosted Services were now you

548
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,620
know everything was completely screwed

549
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,059
up and everything was completely

550
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,460
reversed and that was only because we

551
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,559
had monitoring in place with shonan that

552
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,600
was showing us you know open ports for

553
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,720
our public IP space all right so yes

554
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,159
that kind of raises a little bit more

555
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,960
than situational awareness right that's

556
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,400
that's an alert I want to know right

557
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,620
away but the idea is that as change is

558
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,260
happening in your IP space you want to

559
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,659
be aware of what that looks like so

560
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,960
there is a a filter for Network which we

561
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,000
can do

562
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,520
is just net with the IP and then the

563
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,860
cider notation

564
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,679
you can see that I have 16 results

565
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,220
this is a Microsoft Azure net block so

566
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,820
nothing sensitive that I'm aware of

567
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,640
all right so that would be Network

568
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,799
we can also do something product

569
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,480
specific okay this is kind of

570
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,340
interesting so

571
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,460
we can use a filter

572
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,679
http.html and look for a keyword for

573
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,820
instance

574
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,340
we can say

575
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,100
http.html cvcrm Civic CRM is a open

576
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,380
source CRM product and it has that

577
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,760
keyword in its HTML page that Showdown

578
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,700
is indexing now I've used this before to

579
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,100
track

580
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,419
internal software that we had developed

581
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,720
in a previous organization because there

582
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,299
was there was the development team

583
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:39,840
tended to stand up Dev servers and make

584
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
them publicly accessible

585
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,179
and also sometimes load semi-live data

586
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,480
in them and so using this this

587
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,919
particular this excuse me this

588
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,679
particular technique I found a like a

589
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,539
unique keyword that we had in our

590
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,820
software and then just drop that into

591
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,520
Showdown so anytime we had an instance

592
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,320
of our software show up out on the

593
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,419
public internet I was able to track it

594
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,640
through something like showdan again

595
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,940
we'll take a quick look at what that

596
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,320
looks like in Showdown

597
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,620
so http.html cvcrm

598
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,360
with 842 results

599
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,860
lots of interesting open ports over here

600
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,340
again put yourself to context here is I

601
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,780
am

602
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,880
regularly connecting to show Dan and

603
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,340
pulling down any diffs right anything

604
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,820
that has changed for my IP space or

605
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,799
whatever the query is I'm not going to

606
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,400
be reviewing 842 results every single

607
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,320
time right it's that's the initial cut

608
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,260
and then as change is happening I will

609
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,240
be reviewing that Delta so maybe two

610
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,860
changes happen in the week and now I'm

611
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,960
reviewing that right so I don't have to

612
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,780
review those 842 results every single

613
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,400
time

614
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,860
the final one and this is by far my

615
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,120
favorite

616
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,480
is hostname and SSL filter all right

617
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,900
this is where we drop

618
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,360
a domain for your organization in The

619
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,000
Showdown using the hostname or SSL so if

620
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,820
we find if showdan finds assert with

621
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,220
that domain in it it will go ahead and

622
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,980
show it you can find some really really

623
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,559
interesting things this way all right

624
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,039
again using this technique

625
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,779
a partner organization of ours that was

626
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,240
in another country

627
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,760
I found it just popped up one time again

628
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,220
this partner organization had a lot of

629
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,779
very similar names and very similar

630
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,820
sounding domains just with a different

631
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,100
country code which is why it popped up

632
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,980
and um you know they had network

633
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,900
connections to us so we're very closely

634
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,539
connected with them unfortunately I

635
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,779
believe it was their domain controller

636
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:58,559
that popped up and uh had like 445 open

637
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,960
to the public internet it was you know

638
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,559
it was had not been patched recently

639
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,720
um it was a pretty quick phone call to

640
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,279
them to find out what was going on hey

641
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,220
can we fix this before it gets popped it

642
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,380
probably already was at that point but

643
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,600
again alerting them you know one of our

644
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,919
partner organizations that this was

645
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,080
going on because I'm much more

646
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,539
situationally aware of the context that

647
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,080
I'm operating in is that making sense

648
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,200
okay so for the example here we're going

649
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,679
to use sans.org our our favorite trainer

650
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,799
right so we'll come over here and um

651
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,100
now again the context here is this is

652
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,539
your organization all right I'm not

653
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,340
picking on Sans at all this is just an

654
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,159
example of what it could look like

655
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,580
all right search for sans.org for certs

656
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,740
I have three over three thousand results

657
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,140
now if I look down here at top

658
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,940
organizations you'll actually find out

659
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,940
that

660
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,760
there it is right there top products

661
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,140
that most of these are actually

662
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,720
cloudfront

663
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,720
endpoints so I'm going to filter that

664
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,580
out so I'm going to put a negative or a

665
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,200
minus sign in there

666
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,299
filter that out and that gives me much

667
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,000
more manageable 195 results

668
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,600
all right so you may be saying this is

669
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,980
great Josh I love that I can do this

670
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,720
with shutdown but it's yet another

671
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,059
interface that I have to remember to log

672
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,919
into why can't I just slice and dice

673
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,500
this data inside security onion well

674
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,179
your wish has been granted let's go

675
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,039
ahead and do that

676
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,000
um

677
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,620
all right so I just did a quick file

678
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,860
beat config right where it's at HTTP

679
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,600
Json inputs using the showdan API I just

680
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,419
put in the query that we just used did a

681
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:49,860
couple things here to drop a couple

682
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,679
fields that were having issues and then

683
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,200
this shows up the data should show up

684
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,159
here

685
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,020
let's log into security onion

686
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:04,260
come over to the hunt interface

687
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,360
I'm going to drop down to log type

688
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,760
and I should see probably need last 48

689
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,059
hours

690
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,340
should see Showdown results right there

691
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,380
200 so I did this yesterday I think it

692
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,640
was

693
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,140
all right so I filtered for these

694
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,460
results but again I'm in the hunt

695
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,100
interface and I can do some group buys

696
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,260
but from a long-term monitoring

697
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,179
perspective I want to have a dashboard

698
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,640
that I can just drop into review the

699
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,860
results from the last couple days and

700
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,020
then you know work from there and so

701
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,000
again if you're not familiar with the

702
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,559
dashboards interface is over here on the

703
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,320
left hand side this looks somewhat

704
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,140
familiar to hunt we actually use the

705
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,860
same onion query language for it

706
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,740
I'm going to minimize this right here

707
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,020
we have some nice visualizations we have

708
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,260
some sankies we have our pie chart bar

709
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,140
chart and then our data table

710
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,419
now we do have a free YouTube video I

711
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:04,860
think Matt you put together on

712
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,779
dashboards right so if you want to

713
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,880
actually how to know how to dive into

714
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,179
making this a bit more in depth I'm

715
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,460
going to link you to that video out on

716
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,620
YouTube but for now we're going to go

717
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,299
ahead and look at a dashboard that I

718
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,240
already created and then we'll edit it

719
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,700
with our showdan data

720
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,620
scroll down

721
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,260
we'll see that what I like to do I'm

722
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,820
going to make this yeah there we go

723
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,260
what I like to do when I create

724
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,320
dashboards is start with kind of the uh

725
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,840
the overarching category of data that

726
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,340
I'm looking at and when you talk about

727
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,200
situational awareness and the new data

728
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,880
that you're bringing in you kind of got

729
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,260
to play with it a little bit to figure

730
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,640
out what's going to make the most sense

731
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,840
if you can see

732
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,799
yeah there we go all right over here on

733
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,360
the left hand side I have the showdan

734
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,380
module

735
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,720
and then we have the product type and

736
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
then the port so that's kind of the top

737
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,640
level uh navigation that I decided to do

738
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,740
for this dashboard all right so I can

739
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,360
quickly filter down well that's an

740
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,299
interesting looking Port just left click

741
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,580
click on include and that filters down

742
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,279
to that result and then I see over here

743
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,440
my host names

744
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,559
um the HTTP statuses and cert

745
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,918
information

746
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,039
so that's our top level navigation then

747
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,520
I have a result.host names over here and

748
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,559
then I try to look at the data set and

749
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,559
group like kinds of data together in

750
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,779
this case we have HTTP we have a bunch

751
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:40,020
of HTTP data so we have our HTTP host

752
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,080
the result excuse me the status like 200

753
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,659
404

754
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:48,000
location as well as robots which had

755
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,380
some interesting data in there as well

756
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,919
so as we start you know let's do 200

757
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,559
let's include that

758
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,340
we can start seeing the results

759
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,220
that are there then finally we have

760
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,380
our certs kind of that that bottom

761
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,080
section is reserved for SSL and

762
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,059
everything related to our cert uh

763
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,399
everything related to show Dan and certs

764
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,320
now we can quickly and easily if you see

765
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,140
this little menu over here we can change

766
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,100
the type of visualization we have our

767
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,899
Sand Key right here

768
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:28,080
which we can full screen

769
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,940
and can make some very nice

770
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,580
visualizations gives us again depending

771
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,860
on the data sets you can play around

772
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,480
with the different visualizations to

773
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,039
figure out what's going to make them the

774
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,360
most sense when you're doing your

775
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,899
analysis

776
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,600
so the overall context here is we

777
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,120
brought in our showdan data this is the

778
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,360
initial result set and then as diffs

779
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,299
come along right as we see those those

780
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,340
Deltas come in then we can review those

781
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,580
results on a regular basis okay

782
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,860
again making sense

783
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,399
okay

784
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,340
so we have less than five minutes the

785
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,559
key takeaway well let's let's say real

786
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,799
quick so we started out with

787
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,419
drawing some correlations between

788
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,960
physical and digital security how

789
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,580
um you know we have threat hunting we

790
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,220
have situational awareness and we have

791
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,799
you know automated detections we have a

792
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,539
lot of the same Concepts on the digital

793
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:36,080
side of things really the key takeaway

794
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,679
for this morning is to understand that

795
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,620
I think there's there's some Nuance here

796
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,919
there's something more than targeted

797
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,080
threat hunts and there's something more

798
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,640
than

799
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,860
um than automated detections and that's

800
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,659
where I think the situational awareness

801
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:57,840
falls into and I think you know we use a

802
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,279
lot of different terms in the industry

803
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,779
to describe it I think there's a lot

804
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:04,080
more that could go into it for me I

805
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,059
found that the dashboards inside

806
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,279
security and make it very useful being

807
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,320
able to review that data on a long-term

808
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,460
basis

809
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,740
um and again it's something that I'm

810
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,360
planning on pursuing a bit more in this

811
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,279
next year inside security Union and

812
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,899
seeing what else we can do and

813
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,580
automating this

814
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,320
any questions or comments

815
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,159
clear as mud I just want to go and eat

816
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:33,200
sounds good yes Brian

817
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,919
yeah great question so

818
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,840
didn't show Dan however you want to say

819
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,080
it

820
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,779
I actually have that pulled up

821
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,539
Sheridan is extremely inexpensive all

822
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,059
right I've used the one-time membership

823
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,600
fee of 49 for quite a few years now and

824
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,820
that gives you access to the API there's

825
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,860
also a freelancer for like 70 bucks a

826
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,380
month so the vast majority of what

827
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,720
you're wanting to do because remember

828
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,240
The Showdown data is not updated again I

829
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,520
think it's roughly weekly so if you're

830
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,560
doing this you know maybe once or twice

831
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,540
a week running these queries you're not

832
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,179
going to need a ton of a ton of things

833
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,239
or excuse me a ton of API

834
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,199
um

835
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,580
queries that you're going to need to

836
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,739
purchase so yes you can do some basic

837
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,320
queries through the UI for free but then

838
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,179
it does require membership for more

839
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,800
great question Brian thanks

840
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,440
yes oh yeah yeah so Black Friday every

841
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,139
Black Friday they do a deal I don't

842
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,760
remember how much it is it's like 20

843
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,219
bucks five bucks okay and Black Friday

844
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,980
is coming up real soon right so five

845
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,080
bucks as long as I do it again this year

846
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,418
you can get that one-time subscription

847
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,800
or that one-time fee to Showdown

848
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,760
yes exactly you're hey now

849
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,359
yes

850
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,380
so where did to to bring it into

851
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,580
security onion

852
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,599
yeah that's a great question so uh in

853
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,640
the current version of the platform this

854
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,099
is in yaml format and I dropped this in

855
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,000
the

856
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,940
um the global pillar for uh for security

857
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,500
Union and what that does is then the

858
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,079
next time file beat restarts it'll pick

859
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,359
up this new configuration and pull it

860
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,980
down so I ran this on the manager

861
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,540
directly from the manager

862
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,079
I do not I mean it's connected as in

863
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,680
it's able to you know pull down data but

864
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,380
it's not publicly accessible

865
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,579
good job good job

866
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,180
any other questions yes

867
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,480
I'm sorry I can't hear you

868
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,619
yes

869
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,700
yeah yeah two great questions the first

870
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,260
question is how much can you customize

871
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,839
with those dashboards real quick I'll

872
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,859
just show you um

873
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,420
all right so if we if we drill down into

874
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,880
the actual data like these are the

875
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,980
actual logs down here any of these

876
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,920
fields can be added as a group by all

877
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,020
right so if I wanted to add

878
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,720
um like a Geo

879
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,820
I thought one of these results had you

880
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,040
in them

881
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,940
let's just say ASN all right so I can

882
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,339
click I can do a new group by a new

883
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:51,180
group by will add a new visualization

884
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,339
you can see it added it right here and

885
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:56,220
then I can change it into the pie chart

886
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,500
whatever I want it to be

887
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,839
and then I can add more fields to that

888
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,020
so it's very customizable any field that

889
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,480
is in that original log we can add as

890
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,220
part of a visualization like a current

891
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,920
one or as a new one the second question

892
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,619
was how do you correlate this data to

893
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,920
other data inside security onion so that

894
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,280
is actually part of I didn't end up

895
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,640
doing so if you look at my

896
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,800
processor here part of this processor

897
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,140
should be renaming some Fields if I

898
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,578
rename the fields like

899
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,160
I think it's the the raw one as result

900
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,280
dot hostname if I rename that to

901
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,980
hostname or something like that then you

902
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,359
could automatically correlate it with

903
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:43,980
all the rest of the data that's inside

904
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,280
secure Union because we already use ECS

905
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,260
elastic common schema to make sure that

906
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,300
all the data types are consistent with

907
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,220
their naming so I just did not take the

908
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,260
time to really build out that parsing

909
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,079
but that is something that is on my list

910
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,599
to look at because I do feel like having

911
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,640
some sort of native ability to bring in

912
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,140
Showdown data would be pretty pretty

913
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,540
interesting so that's something that I'd

914
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,040
like to do

915
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,560
great questions

916
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,540
any other thoughts

917
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,079
one more

918
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,339
I mean I'm fine with a snarky comment as

919
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:20,299
well that's totally fine

920
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,260
all right thank you all very much thanks

921
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,510
Phil

922
