1
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,640
[Applause]

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,679
good morning

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,240
make sure that all of this stuff works

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,060
we had to make it as complicated as

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,340
possible by bringing three people down

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,779
to give this presentation so we're as

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,420
Phil says we are from the University of

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,119
South Carolina and we are part of the

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,560
security operations and incident

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,140
response team so our talk is a little

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,420
bit different today in that it's not

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,239
super technical but we're going to talk

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,300
about uh people process and technology

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,600
so since security onion conference we'll

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,399
talk just a little bit about security

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,500
onion but it's not going to be super

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
technical part of the rationale behind

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
this talk is a lot of y'all are

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,960
influential people in security

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,620
operations you might be met in

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,600
management or you might create

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
applications that are used by security

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,580
operations teams so we wanted to give

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,600
you a little bit of a flavor of what's

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,939
going on in an environment in a

26
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,979
university environment where security

27
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,659
onion is being used

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,659
so a little bit about us I'm Robert

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,880
Wilson I'm the director of security

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,580
operations in IR for the University I've

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,799
been with the university for about two

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,799
and a half years so I came from

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,320
South Carolina state government and I've

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,540
been doing this kind of stuff for a very

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,119
long time

36
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,159
Jonathan Martin has been with the

37
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,060
university since the 1800s so he he he

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,420
is our institutional knowledge and then

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,700
Alex Galloway also came from state

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,560
government and he's been with us for

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,399
about

42
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,560
six months to it not not quite a year

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,280
so to start off with let me just set the

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,079
stage for you a little bit

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,899
a lot of you there might be people that

46
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,179
come from higher ed that are here

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,840
higher ed is what we would refer to as a

48
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,660
Target Rich environment so

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,800
if anything exists we have it so when

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,959
y'all you know you're looking at Twitter

51
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,260
and there's some TV that comes out and a

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,760
lot of times people say oh we don't have

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,700
that well our perspective is where is it

54
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,459
because almost every time that something

55
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,140
comes out

56
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,860
cve wise you know configuration any

57
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,860
anything we we have so on the Columbia

58
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,599
campus we have roughly 40 000 IPS that

59
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,200
we can see on a daily basis there are

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,060
comprehensive campuses there's one right

61
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,120
up the road in Aitkin upstate South

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,459
Carolina and some various other

63
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,360
locations so it's extremely complex the

64
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,060
other part about the complexity is we

65
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,840
are highly Federated so if you work in

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,819
government and you know about the way

67
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,879
that executive branches work

68
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,220
where you have an executive or you know

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,739
you work in the federal space or state

70
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,019
you got an executive and then you have a

71
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,959
bunch of cabinet agencies or people that

72
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,260
are actually doing doing the work

73
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,879
universities are somewhat like that in

74
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,040
that you have a president and then

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,700
you've got Deans in colleges and you've

76
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,680
got other campuses where they have

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,140
chancellors so there are a lot of people

78
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,440
who have input into processes in

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,540
Academia

80
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,200
so what that turns into you is there are

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,340
a lot of chiefs a lot of times and the

82
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,680
complexity is not just technical it's

83
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,280
also political so we in the security

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,400
operations in IR area a lot of times

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,440
we're operating more like a mssp because

86
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,440
we don't necessarily know what's going

87
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,900
on in an environment until we get there

88
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,519
so a lot of what we're going to talk

89
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,040
about today is how we're beginning to

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,940
address that and that kind of stuff so

91
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,820
from since you know a lot we're all

92
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,940
nerds right so we

93
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,979
are interested in technology and you

94
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,020
know what do you have if it's highly

95
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,240
complex and it's a Target Rich

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,940
environment and all that kind of stuff

97
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,660
we have everything from a research

98
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,180
cluster that has multi terabytes of RAM

99
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,400
and 15 000 cores down to nt4 boxes that

100
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,660
are connected to lab equipment that you

101
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,120
who knows what what the status of it is

102
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,240
you could have a my wife works in

103
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,240
theater and they could have some kind of

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,100
theater device that's IP connected

105
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,080
that's going to send sound

106
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
from

107
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,000
a Macintosh to a speaker and the speaker

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,479
run runs Linux right so we could get

109
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,220
taken over because it's never going to

110
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,259
get patched so a lot of what we're

111
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,940
seeing on the network is you know

112
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,460
basically one of everything is what it

113
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,199
comes down to you

114
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,160
data was we have PCI we've got sieges we

115
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,120
have a power plant we have medical

116
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,699
facilities anything that you can think

117
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,680
of we're kind of it's kind of like a

118
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,680
town we run our own ISP so we have

119
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,139
students on campus wireless networks

120
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,039
that have PlayStations on them tour you

121
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,960
know bit more you know whatever you

122
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,139
think we've got it so you can't think of

123
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,699
it in terms of

124
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,860
you know we're a corporation and

125
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,780
everyone's going to run you know

126
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,520
whatever the newest build of Windows 11

127
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,520
and etc etc so there are Pockets where

128
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
we can do that kind of stuff but we have

129
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,780
to be able to do IR for all of it

130
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,300
so here is a shot of what 24 hours worth

131
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,220
of traffic on our Network looks like so

132
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,740
Security on your conference all of our

133
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,380
data runs through security onion as far

134
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,979
as our Sim that's we use for our Sim so

135
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,539
part of what we're going to talk about

136
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,580
today is

137
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,860
if we are moving toward doing

138
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,919
student-driven services

139
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,199
we want to be able to bring students in

140
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,240
to sit down in front of security onion

141
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,759
our internal internal tools and all that

142
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,340
kind of stuff when they were working at

143
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,100
Chick-fil-A or Starbucks the week before

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,479
so

145
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,020
we so there's three of us here there's a

146
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,539
couple of other full-time people that

147
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:02,400
that's not a uh sustainable number of

148
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,500
people for the amount of complexity that

149
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,419
I just described for us to get better

150
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,199
over time so what we said was we have

151
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,940
all of these students we've got these

152
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,520
cyber Security Programs we're going to

153
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,840
switch to having a student-driven sock

154
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,380
so our one phrase that we use to

155
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,360
describe that is that we have a teaching

156
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,699
sock so a lot of y'all are familiar with

157
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,979
the concept of a teaching hospital where

158
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,960
medicine still goes on but you have

159
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,240
medical students to come through you

160
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,800
know Future Dark doctors we have future

161
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,660
information security analysts that come

162
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,940
through our sock so we want them to be

163
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,280
able to go out and make much more money

164
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,740
than we make and it happens all the time

165
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,220
which is is good so you're a new student

166
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,580
you come in this is what 24 hours worth

167
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,979
of traffic looks like and you sit down

168
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:00,120
at your console and you see this

169
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,620
so I'm not going to disparage tools but

170
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,599
I will talk about some ways that things

171
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,759
can be done a little bit better and

172
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,039
there are some big gaps in the triage

173
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,440
process a lot of what we're going to

174
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,280
talk about has to do with triaging alert

175
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,860
so this y'all are familiar with this

176
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,879
probably so this is the hive new analyst

177
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,280
sits down they've got

178
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,300
one IP talking to another IP and it's an

179
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,520
alarm last week they were working at

180
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,299
Chick-fil-A or Starbucks or nowhere you

181
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,799
know maybe they have a new experience

182
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,599
even with working at all

183
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,399
they sit down and it's an alarm and then

184
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,740
they talk to the analyst that's sitting

185
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,899
next to them and the analyst says all

186
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,700
right let's do this this is what we're

187
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,660
going to do

188
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,300
you're going to import that alert and

189
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,899
move it from being an alert to a case

190
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:01,500
run the enrichment steps find out which

191
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,800
computer it is out of the Forty thousand

192
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,860
find out whether or not that attack

193
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,660
is even applicable to the computer

194
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,000
Etc et cetera so this is intentionally

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,740
over the top

196
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,320
so that you get an idea of what it felt

197
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,019
like and it probably felt like this to

198
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,700
many of the people that are in here when

199
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,500
you started right because this this

200
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,440
isn't unique to students this happens

201
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,980
with full-time staff also so this is the

202
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,600
kind of thing that we're working to

203
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,160
address

204
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Jonathan could sit down with a a new

205
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,680
student and go through all of these

206
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,600
steps but really what you're doing is

207
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
you're reinforcing the way that it's

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,440
always been done

209
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,600
and that's kind of what we want to get

210
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,339
away from

211
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,860
so well it's not kind of what we want to

212
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,300
get away from it is what we want to get

213
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,459
away from so the problems that we

214
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,260
identify with this and this is basically

215
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,260
what my role is is to push this kind of

216
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,640
stuff so one of the advantages to coming

217
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,920
into a new environment is to look at

218
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,720
everything and say why are you doing

219
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,640
this

220
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,740
that basically is what I've been doing

221
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,140
for the last two years why are we doing

222
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,760
it this way

223
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,620
that stuff that we were just talking

224
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,800
about is extremely manual why are you

225
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,680
making someone

226
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,480
run even if you're going into the hive

227
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,820
and you're going to run enrichments why

228
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,580
isn't that already there the stuff like

229
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,580
that the the other part about it is it

230
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,940
kind of reinforces and this is a soapbox

231
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,180
thing because we in my previous life I

232
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,120
worked at an agency where we had interns

233
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,920
that went off and got security jobs and

234
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,760
there was a lot of culture of

235
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,399
rtfm and Googling you know I had to

236
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,339
learn how to do this by you know someone

237
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,839
telling me

238
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,940
you read the manual you know or Google

239
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,100
whatever that alert is all that kind of

240
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,800
stuff the problem with that mindset is

241
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,440
that autonomy given too early in a

242
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,240
process is a burden

243
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,300
so it is it is a true statement that

244
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,660
people need to learn how to figure out

245
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,420
how to do this stuff but someone that is

246
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,220
in the beginning of their career

247
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,320
you may turn them off from doing

248
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,760
security work it at all by having that

249
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,820
that kind of mindset so it takes skill

250
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,640
to deter to figure out when you need to

251
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,519
tell that person go out and Google it

252
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,760
versus you know spending more time with

253
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,600
them

254
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,820
and I can guarantee you that someone

255
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,860
that comes in that's been working at

256
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,200
Chick-fil-A if they haven't already done

257
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,560
a lot of work on their own 99 of the

258
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,640
stuff that they're going to see that

259
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,420
comes in they are not ready to Google it

260
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,420
they you know what is a port they they

261
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,180
don't even know what a port is so you

262
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,000
have to spend a lot of time with

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,980
people

264
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,019
going over that kind of stuff rather

265
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,839
than just dropping them off

266
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,279
the issue with what I just said though

267
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,560
with the spending a lot of time with

268
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,700
them is scale it's really hard to scale

269
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,800
that we only have one Jonathan we have

270
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,360
one me we have one Alex so if the

271
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,279
president of the University comes and

272
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,680
says all right y'all are doing

273
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,000
student-driven security stuff you you

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,760
want to train all these people uh here's

275
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,160
funding for 15 more students it

276
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,459
immediately becomes a very hard thing to

277
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,700
do to train 15 people if Jonathan has to

278
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,220
rotate through all 15 of them it's even

279
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,700
harder if five of them are an Aiken five

280
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,800
of them are in Spartanburg and five of

281
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,700
them are in Colombia so

282
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,120
the other part about that is you're

283
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,700
there's an analogy that y'all might have

284
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,700
heard about before that the grug

285
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,760
gave in a talk a few years ago having to

286
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,339
do with hacking and defending and it

287
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,339
came down to the beginning of when we

288
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,720
were doing this kind of security stuff

289
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,639
let's say in the 90s

290
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,060
it was a lot of individual hacker versus

291
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,820
individual Defender so think back to

292
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,160
cuckoo's egg and all all that kind of

293
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,540
stuff that isn't scalable and in war

294
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,000
fighting what happened was you've got

295
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,279
these aces in World War II one ace

296
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,260
against another race they're fighting

297
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,480
each other over time that isn't

298
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,639
sustainable so you have to turn it into

299
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,320
a system where you're going to overwhelm

300
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,740
with as many planes as possible

301
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,200
having Jonathan sit down with people

302
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,860
individually one at a time is like the

303
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,620
world war one one fighter race one

304
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,060
person learning from the fighter race

305
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,920
and then they were gonna go off and do

306
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,260
their work we need it to be more like

307
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,860
let's do 15 people at once get the

308
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,200
system working and having them work on

309
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,220
stuff

310
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,740
the other thing with this is just

311
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,079
looking at that gives you burn out right

312
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
if you you have to do that kind of

313
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,120
operation all day long you're not going

314
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
to do this kind of work for very long

315
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,160
so what we decided to do about it is do

316
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,959
quite a number of things and that's what

317
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,120
these guys are going to talk about but

318
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,639
in general what I said was let's start

319
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,079
looking at these things like software

320
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,940
problems partially

321
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,700
so we need to create a system systems or

322
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,000
kind of like coding so let's break this

323
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,740
into chunks and then either adjust our

324
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,680
processes write code whatever it takes

325
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,019
in order to address that kind of thing

326
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,120
part of that is coming up with a

327
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,579
framework of what needs to happen

328
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,279
and the other thing that I really

329
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,920
reinforced is I want the computers to do

330
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,579
a lot more for us because what ends up

331
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,639
happening in that other in the John

332
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,040
Ritter scenario of what are you talking

333
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,399
about is you're putting a high cognitive

334
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,339
load on the analyst and the person

335
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,040
that's learning because if you have to

336
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,540
ask all these questions and do that

337
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,800
stuff manually

338
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,440
then by the time that you get to

339
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,079
actually doing the investigation your

340
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,959
brain is already tired you know what do

341
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,600
you mean I have to find this thing so

342
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,540
killing

343
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,180
that part of it is kind of the the

344
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,800
underlying

345
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,160
theme of this this kind of stuff is make

346
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,440
the computer do a lot more work the

347
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,000
other part about it is doing a lot more

348
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,360
measurement not for things like like I'm

349
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,240
not a super big fan of you know these

350
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,980
people need to be doing X number of

351
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,480
cases per day all that kind of stuff

352
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,180
that that's not a good methodology for

353
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,959
this kind of environment but what how

354
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,660
many times have we seen this alert how

355
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,940
many times do

356
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,880
you know

357
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,500
Apache servers get hit and they're out

358
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,660
of date those kinds of things can turn

359
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,000
into

360
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,560
feedback for preventive controls and all

361
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,940
that kind of stuff and that really

362
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,399
wasn't being done that well it was very

363
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,940
ad hoc

364
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,519
so one of the things with that is I want

365
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,639
to highlight the work that expel does

366
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,000
with their blog expel.io if you're not

367
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,220
familiar with their their blog and what

368
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,860
they write about as far as measurement

369
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,440
and quality control and all that kind of

370
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,899
stuff you should check it out so if

371
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,720
there's anyone here from expel I salute

372
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,000
your your company's work in that area

373
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,699
so how did we do it

374
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:57,839
we did it through the work of these two

375
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,100
guys

376
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,860
and I will turn it over to Jonathan

377
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:13,459
all right can you hear me is it working

378
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,419
oh cool that does work

379
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,819
all right so yeah

380
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,980
uh Roberts already mentioned it once

381
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,959
that we're a teaching sock we uh we're

382
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,580
like uh we'd like to think of ourselves

383
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,020
like doctors telling med school students

384
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,940
go reattach that arm

385
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,220
um but with malware instead and we work

386
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,900
almost exclusively with uh college

387
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,220
students

388
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,120
um

389
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,740
luckily we're a university we can

390
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,059
actually take college students in from a

391
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,679
computer science program and our RIT

392
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
program that works out pretty well but

393
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,980
that's not the only place we get them

394
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,120
from I'm going to go ahead and tell you

395
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,679
don't knock the English majors and one

396
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,000
of the highest Flyers we ever had was a

397
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,740
biomed engineering major

398
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,580
so um

399
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,080
yeah so we are we recruit from

400
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,340
everywhere we recruited from the Cyber

401
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,559
Patriot uh competition in the United

402
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,320
States Air Force local high schools we

403
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,340
work with them with their guidance

404
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,140
counselors to uh

405
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,000
to kind of intercept people coming in we

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,320
do job shadowing with these with

407
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,760
incoming high school students and

408
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,400
identify incoming Talent we get students

409
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,539
from all over

410
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,860
um happy to have them we have some rock

411
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,600
stars too let me tell you

412
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,100
and when we get them what we do is we

413
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,780
put them in an immersion program so

414
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,220
Robert mentioned there for the flipping

415
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,480
burgers two weeks ago and now they're

416
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,820
working security incidents

417
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,620
um

418
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,660
I have not found a good way to do this

419
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,340
other than sit them in front of the

420
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,780
screen and say okay let's just start

421
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,460
working it oh so you don't know what an

422
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,200
IP address is okay this is an IP address

423
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
literally going from that uh that low

424
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,419
sometimes all the way up to okay here's

425
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:43,799
how you exploit something with above

426
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,299
rubber flow

427
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,140
um

428
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,419
if you ever try this get them as close

429
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,580
to freshman as you can then the longer

430
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,200
the more time you can spend with them

431
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,160
the better off you're going to be

432
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,679
and when we get them in we uh

433
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,480
like I mentioned we just we sit with

434
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,700
them we give them alerts to work we

435
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,419
don't

436
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,039
say okay well now you need to go learn

437
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,660
how to do X Y and Z and go install an

438
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,860
operating system now we don't do that

439
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,179
day one they're working alerts with us

440
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,679
is it right next to us

441
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,780
uh sure they're deer in the headlights

442
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,760
but they're sitting right next to us

443
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,080
um

444
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
tends to work out pretty well we have a

445
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
curriculum that we also are developing

446
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,780
we're building out uh the idea is that

447
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,000
we put this curriculum on a sift VM

448
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,700
ah and

449
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,919
as we work alerts we want them to review

450
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,600
this content that we have too so if

451
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,160
we're if they're reviewing a packet

452
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,299
capture

453
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,840
uh we wanted we want the material to be

454
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,120
available to them to say okay how did we

455
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,679
even get this package what is a packet

456
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,960
what do you do with the packet uh

457
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,700
as a Robert was saying it's not

458
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,400
necessarily scalable for me to sit with

459
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,740
15 people and do this 15 times in a

460
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,380
semester probably won't work so we're

461
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,100
trying to build out methods that will uh

462
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,200
basically automate or otherwise

463
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,080
reduce the load on one person

464
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,700
if you ever try this I'm also going to

465
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,720
go ahead and tell you now the cross

466
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,000
training there's no substitute they say

467
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
I've heard this somewhere before that a

468
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,299
security analyst is an I.T professional

469
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,600
with 10 years of experience okay well

470
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,340
this guy's flipping burgers two weeks

471
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,919
ago he doesn't have 10 years experience

472
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,419
um cross-trained to the best of your

473
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,679
ability and maybe that would work for

474
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,059
your fds too but not just students

475
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,280
so put yourself in the shoes or somebody

476
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,559
who's uh flipping burgers and now

477
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,059
they're doing security alerts they don't

478
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,020
know what they don't know they don't

479
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,880
even know where to start they don't know

480
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,980
what authentication is much less how to

481
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,480
see if somebody's uh

482
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,039
from Russia is doing something evil to

483
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,900
us so uh

484
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,880
just sort of help out with that we kind

485
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,860
of built this uh this set of milestones

486
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,059
for it but not to mention I think kids

487
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,700
just kind of react well to achievement

488
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,620
badges such as games you beat Pikachu

489
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,440
500 times so it's even badge you can

490
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,820
work authentication alerts now you get

491
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,340
the level one badge they seem to react

492
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,000
to this pretty well

493
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,520
and we also want to use it to sort of

494
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,039
prevent burnout too uh if you stare at

495
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,419
alerts for six months I don't know if

496
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,559
anybody here has worked on a stock

497
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,880
probably most of you have at least at

498
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,140
one point

499
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,679
um nothing but alerts can burn you out

500
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,940
hence engineering development stock

501
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,340
achievement badges at the bottom

502
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,780
uh

503
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,059
what we would really like to do in my

504
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,880
perfect world if I had a magic wand the

505
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,440
students who come in by the time they

506
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,600
leave can do all of these is that

507
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,100
realistic maybe maybe not I don't know

508
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,659
but it's what I'm shooting for shooting

509
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,320
for the Stars

510
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,900
this is the most hated phrase in the

511
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,360
sock is it real and do I care

512
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,960
we drill this all right this is if

513
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,000
you're you've probably taken Sands 504

514
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,919
or you know someone who has it's just

515
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,080
the identification step of pick roll

516
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,240
that's all that really is but laid out

517
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,340
in a way that

518
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,679
people seem to respond to having no I.T

519
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,320
experience whatsoever so that's Robert's

520
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,059
talking about uh taking in 15 people

521
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,919
who've never done this before and train

522
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,200
them up on how to do it this is one of

523
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,419
the ways we do it we drill not what

524
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:09,179
button do you click not what website do

525
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,220
you go to but how do you get the answer

526
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,679
to a question such as

527
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,679
this web server is attacking us okay

528
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,860
what is it doing it's using this exploit

529
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,539
it's an Apache exploit okay is that an

530
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,760
Apache web server no it's an is web

531
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,100
server okay is it real do we care no we

532
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,940
don't care

533
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,640
just move on next alert it didn't work

534
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,919
however

535
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,360
let's say we did care let's say it

536
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,860
wasn't Apache exploit against an Apache

537
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,240
web server it was vulnerable so on and

538
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,460
so forth we have it sort of laid out for

539
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,179
them

540
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,400
in a way that can help guide them to the

541
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,500
point where they know that oh we need to

542
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,659
escalate this because that ioc hit

543
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,140
and if I'm talking about drilling is it

544
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,980
real and do I care

545
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,960
you didn't see the whole conversation up

546
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,580
on the screen right now but it's a

547
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,900
partial conversation where we're working

548
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,100
with some students on how to

549
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,500
remediate an authentication compromise

550
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,360
um

551
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,799
I really wish I could have put more of

552
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,120
this up there I really loved this

553
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,500
conversation this was just a couple of

554
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,840
weeks ago day on here is pointing out

555
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,220
very cool things that you can't see all

556
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,600
of it but he's pointing out her evidence

557
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,280
that this is an automated attack by

558
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,500
various means I can only get on here uh

559
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,120
going through the list in alphabetical

560
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,320
order

561
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,020
but point being she did it she's

562
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,940
graduating yeah so it looks like she's

563
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,320
going to move on to a very nice company

564
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,419
too by the way

565
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,820
so what we wanted to do a lot of the

566
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,900
time that we're done with them by the

567
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,460
time they're moving away from us

568
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,200
I would love for them to be able to take

569
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,760
an alert like that what do you see up on

570
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,880
the screen is it uh suspicious inbox

571
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,299
manipulation rule pull out the iocs map

572
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,900
it to such tools as the Pyramid of pain

573
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,520
basically explain to me what you do with

574
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,080
this data so what you got on alert I

575
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,159
don't care that you got an alert what

576
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,960
does it tell you what was the impact to

577
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,520
me that's the secret sauce when they can

578
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,280
say that when they can say now that we

579
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,720
had a malware alert but instead that

580
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,600
they say we have a executable that came

581
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,919
from a Russian web server and it can

582
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,179
steal passwords because it hooks the

583
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,380
kernel

584
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,940
awesome

585
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,980
that's what we're going for and that's

586
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,179
what we're trying to train we don't want

587
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,440
we don't want to alert clear people we

588
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,059
want we want analysts

589
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,980
so to uh

590
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,840
Robert's point there can only be one the

591
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,159
only one of me I can only sit with so

592
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,900
many people at once

593
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,860
um

594
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,240
they try to cloned me it didn't work the

595
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,039
so the idea

596
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,020
let's take

597
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,120
as much as we can all the common stuff

598
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,860
that we see account compromises malware

599
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,260
whatever right essentially you know you

600
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,460
probably know these things called

601
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,740
playbooks uh

602
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,960
and distribute them to the students as

603
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,700
alerts come across the wire

604
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,620
along with our curriculum stuff too by

605
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,980
the way so if you need to know how to do

606
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,340
basic analysis of malware

607
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,539
hopefully what we do actually now we

608
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:01,620
have a

609
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,720
curriculum item for that essentially a

610
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,220
knowledge base a knowledge base item for

611
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,260
that along with a Playbook

612
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,659
the idea is why couldn't we take what I

613
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,080
would have said

614
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,580
in this chat

615
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,980
turn it to something like this and just

616
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,020
ship it right along with the alert

617
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,880
that could happen automatically and then

618
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,500
okay now we're reaching that scalability

619
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,720
issue that uh Robert was talking about

620
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,919
it's going to be one of me that 15

621
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,720
students can't sit with them all

622
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,760
cool let's automate the uh what I would

623
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,480
have said anyways

624
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,039
to give you an idea what we would attach

625
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,659
to alert as it goes by I'll go and tell

626
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,340
you right now the second item there apt

627
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,360
students don't work Russian compromises

628
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,820
they're not getting the ransomware cases

629
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,679
but but

630
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,020
if we do it right they when they leave

631
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,820
they will have seen what you're supposed

632
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,779
to do

633
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,159
they would if whenever they go to work

634
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,200
for someone here they would say yeah I

635
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,400
know what to do when ransomware shows up

636
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,299
you fire up your resume

637
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,559
on the right hand side to just give you

638
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,539
an example what would we show them

639
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,460
what would we give them as a set of

640
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,440
steps so the the teams chat from a

641
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,700
couple of slides back that was all ad

642
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,380
hoc

643
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,940
this

644
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,020
yeah

645
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,600
clearly more sustainable more repeatable

646
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,460
they've seen it 10 times now they don't

647
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,779
need to see it anymore they've drilled

648
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,520
it they've got it by the time they leave

649
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,720
us they know how to do these things and

650
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,740
things up on the screen right now

651
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,320
so in my experience what can a student

652
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
be sharing to do the answer is it

653
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,799
depends 50 of the time it works every

654
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,100
time that's what I would say we tend to

655
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,340
produce two types of graduates

656
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,840
one is a security analyst and the other

657
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,100
is a developer and it's about 50 50

658
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,120
split

659
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,220
uh for the developers I say it's not

660
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,539
necessary of course I want to produce

661
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,580
security people of course I do but when

662
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,900
we produce the developer instead I don't

663
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,460
call it a defeat or anything because now

664
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,659
they're scared straight developers

665
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,159
they've seen what happens whenever you

666
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,140
don't say sanitize your user input

667
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,539
correctly

668
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:58,320
you know they're better off they're

669
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,279
better off even if they don't go into

670
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,600
security that's cool

671
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,460
so

672
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,000
I want to give you an example of

673
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,799
I guess you just call it a success story

674
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,860
uh y'all remember log Forge

675
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,159
yeah yeah yeah so uh Robert and I we're

676
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,059
in here at USC log forged uh well long

677
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,279
Fortune happens we're up to our ears and

678
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,659
work we can't do soft work right now

679
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,640
we're now triaging uh alerts we're not

680
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,779
even working with the students right now

681
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,580
we don't have time we're in panic mode

682
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,440
fortnite's down we gotta go

683
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,240
so the uh

684
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,679
so our students were basically left

685
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,799
alone that's what it basically means

686
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,179
along the triage alerts all by

687
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:37,559
themselves I can't sit next to them

688
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,960
right now and I'm happy to report that

689
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,760
we had a real breach well we can't call

690
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,080
it a bridge because it's not it wasn't

691
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,080
that we had a real Attack that the

692
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,640
our students were able to handle

693
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,779
independently

694
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,900
where there was a lot of activity a lot

695
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,000
of

696
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,919
artifacts we'll say and a lot of

697
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,500
remediation to do they did it correctly

698
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,980
they did it right and I only had small

699
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,340
amounts of almost just nitpicking

700
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,860
kinda I would have done this differently

701
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,659
they they handled it very well being my

702
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,960
point that was log boards that time

703
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,340
frame it's right about them when I

704
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,600
thought hey we're starting to get this

705
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,959
thing right

706
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,919
foreign

707
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,980
so uh cool we've done it we've uh we

708
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,179
know that we can do it we know that we

709
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:33,539
need to scale it up we know that uh

710
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,760
we know how to win in this that's what

711
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,679
is where we're going and

712
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,120
what we need to do we need to get better

713
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,159
at scaling we need to get better at

714
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,980
automation essentially Robert saw this

715
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,919
Robert knew this Robert Alex

716
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,700
cool cool so a couple things one there

717
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,740
was a Highlander quote and it was

718
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,539
backwards and that's my fault sorry I

719
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,039
didn't realize until now it can be the

720
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,900
only one not there could only be one so

721
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,480
80s movies fans that's on me

722
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,480
um number two uh I couldn't even

723
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,400
remember how to do PowerPoint slide

724
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,500
transitions it's been so long it's like

725
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,360
such a bad practice now that I was in

726
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,279
there for like 10 minutes how do I make

727
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,279
the glass break what how does this work

728
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,260
didn't we used to do this all the time

729
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,659
couldn't remember at all

730
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,340
um but I figured it out eventually so

731
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,140
there that's the last one I promised now

732
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,200
uh so as Robert said I am fairly new to

733
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,120
the university it's been six to sevenish

734
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,399
months something like that serving as

735
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,980
the lead security engineer and you know

736
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,240
I have my of course official

737
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,799
responsibilities but what I take on is

738
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,600
my duty is the reason I came to the

739
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,480
university in the first place is that I

740
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,480
want to help the students I want I was a

741
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,980
university student University of South

742
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,140
Carolina compsi I want to help the

743
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,700
University students that are there who

744
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,059
are cops on and so uh everything that I

745
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,679
do revolves around making sure that we

746
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,899
set them up to make way more money than

747
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,179
we're making today and that's all it's

748
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,380
about

749
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,159
um

750
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,899
in addition to that you know we're

751
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:01,980
talking about security we're talking

752
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,159
about our sock and making sure that I

753
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,919
add efficiency and process Improvement

754
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,779
so one of the things we look at or I

755
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,120
look at are bottlenecks duplicate work

756
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,740
unnecessary work I'll talk about that in

757
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,200
detail in just a bit uh go over how we

758
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,880
work through the educational part of

759
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,059
being a teaching sock as Robert said

760
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,460
collecting measurements metrics um you

761
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,340
know as Robert said it's political and

762
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,760
you know we we depend upon tax revenue

763
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,220
and tax revenue does not get doled out

764
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,020
like fine wine you know you've got to be

765
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,880
able to indicate what these guys are

766
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,640
doing are is uh they'll be able to show

767
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,919
value as to what it is that we're doing

768
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,179
we're not just a bunch of nerds and

769
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,440
they're talking about Star Wars like

770
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,059
this is serious business we're really

771
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,340
preventing

772
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,340
um some serious attacks automation I'll

773
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,399
talk about that technical inclusivity an

774
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,260
important concept a whole slide on that

775
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,980
one and then not just the sock which uh

776
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,960
maybe something you experience in your

777
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,640
environments maybe not but I'm going to

778
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,620
hop on that one as well

779
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,100
so first things first right

780
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,899
um

781
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:11,760
but bottlenecks unnecessary work

782
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,919
duplicate work how can I as the lead

783
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,860
security engineer start to alleviate

784
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,899
some of those problems so we start with

785
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,419
bottlenecks as Robert said Jonathan I'm

786
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:22,620
sorry I'm walking around if I'm messing

787
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,179
up the web thing here let me stand right

788
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,840
here Jonathan's been here since 1801 I

789
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,340
think he you did the groundbreaking

790
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,720
right

791
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,000
you found at the University yes yeah he

792
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,679
had a powdered wig on and everything it

793
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,799
was it's we've got photos from 1801.

794
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,500
um no Jonathan is a bottleneck himself

795
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,260
because of his institutional knowledge

796
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,240
because he brings so much to the sock

797
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
that if Jonathan were to win the lottery

798
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,679
what are we going to do a lot of that

799
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,659
goes away I'm sure we've all been in

800
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,820
jobs when we left we took a lot of

801
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,860
institutional knowledge with us and kind

802
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,260
of left them with the bag so to speak so

803
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,000
one of my jobs lead security engineer

804
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,919
one of the first things I did was sit

805
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,020
down with Jonathan try to learn what it

806
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,200
is that Jonathan has then find the gaps

807
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,720
not just little things like how do you

808
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,279
log into this service or that service

809
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,720
but what is the process that you use

810
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,820
where is that documented how are we

811
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,919
going to continue this when you know

812
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,720
Jeff Bezos calls you and offers you a

813
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,640
half a million dollar a year job

814
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,559
the aspiration for all of us right just

815
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,539
a call from Jeff Bezos at random you

816
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,299
know we'd all Let It Go to voicemail uh

817
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,919
so those are the yes and those are the

818
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,240
types of human bottlenecks we're trying

819
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,679
to work through and this technical

820
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,559
bottlenecks as well again we've got uh

821
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,419
services that may not be working

822
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:43,440
efficiently we've got a lack of services

823
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,100
um

824
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,679
a lack of monitoring in some areas where

825
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,779
we need increased monitoring so it's my

826
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:49,980
responsibility to get in there and

827
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,600
figure out how we can make improvements

828
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,480
I take a look at unnecessary work

829
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,919
initially

830
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,899
we were in the office right now we're a

831
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:59,700
little more remote than we were this is

832
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,200
obviously hard to run the work from home

833
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,779
era but I'm just shoulder surf like just

834
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,520
show me what it is you do

835
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,200
how do you do it I'm not trying to guide

836
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,600
you down a path what is it you do and we

837
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,480
start finding things like Jonathan uses

838
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,980
the uh

839
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,440
the web interface to get some enrichment

840
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,260
for a particular alert someone else uses

841
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,840
cortex to do the enrichment for the

842
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,760
particular someone else is using a CLI

843
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,399
tool to get the same enrichment for the

844
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,500
same alert you don't see those things

845
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,559
unless you just sit and observe and

846
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,179
understand what people's processes are

847
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,740
and then it's my responsibility to

848
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,899
figure out how could I unify that as

849
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,519
Robert said I'm going to talk about how

850
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,960
can I get the computer to do it I think

851
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,779
that's actually the next slide spoilers

852
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,880
um and we're reducing a lot of that

853
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,820
duplicate work down

854
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,159
uh so as I said right the reason I'm

855
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,080
here is for education I love the picture

856
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,440
here because one of the uh

857
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,899
students that we have actually was in

858
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,779
high school in the robotics club and she

859
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,000
well she right and so we've got she here

860
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,840
whatever that means uh we recognize that

861
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,699
all of our students are Engineers okay

862
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,260
all most of them are computer science

863
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,839
we've got one or two that are not but

864
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,520
they're very strong in some of the same

865
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,839
areas

866
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,440
so rather than just tell them what to do

867
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,119
or as Robert pointed out they don't know

868
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,679
how to GTS

869
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,918
we sit them down and inundate them with

870
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,839
what we're doing and they'll pick up a

871
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,520
lot of it so for example this particular

872
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,839
student

873
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,659
um had a real Vigor for learning all

874
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,918
these things that she had never

875
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:37,679
encountered before I want to do Azure

876
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,379
stuff cool I've got a meeting at two

877
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,119
o'clock with mandiant we've got to set

878
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,879
up our service with them join and then

879
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,918
she just gets Blown Away with no chance

880
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,659
to ask questions because there's two

881
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,159
Engineers trying to get the job done in

882
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,659
30 minutes but you're here you're

883
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,460
looking at the portal you're looking at

884
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,440
us build resources you're looking at us

885
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,180
just quickly take care of things and

886
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,760
then she can come back later and say hey

887
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,220
what did you mean by platform as a

888
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,320
service what is that all about then I

889
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,060
can explain it to her feel free to take

890
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,460
all the notes you want uh I've put it in

891
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,960
scenarios we've put her in scenarios

892
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,760
where uh we talk about threat hunting

893
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,400
and running queries and she's like what

894
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
is what is the querying language great

895
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,760
sit down let's talk about kql right and

896
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,500
we walk her through kql and the funny

897
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,420
thing thing was I've never used kql and

898
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,560
I had to walk her through it and I was

899
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,940
like yeah that works that looks good

900
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,880
sure you know how do you sequel I mean

901
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,380
that's all the same stuff right but

902
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,599
that's what it's about is inclusivity we

903
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,060
we treat them first class they are

904
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,920
Engineers they are to us full-time

905
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,540
Engineers even if they can only come in

906
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,940
three hours a week four hours a week or

907
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,079
whatever it may be because of their

908
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,599
class schedules their first class all of

909
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,339
that documentation that Jonathan showed

910
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,520
the graphs the um you guys probably have

911
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,020
to clean an eye for some of the markdown

912
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,940
uh default uh UI but all that is all

913
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,980
done with documentation as code and all

914
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,020
those students pull down the code and

915
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,000
they make corrections to it one of our

916
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,160
students has pulled it down and we've

917
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,280
helped he has built a continuous

918
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,200
integration pipeline for the code so

919
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,480
he's had to go do some not so fun work

920
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,900
of cleaning up Jonathan's typos but he's

921
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,579
constantly in there he's constantly

922
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:18,900
having to read it he's constantly having

923
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,760
to learn about it step back and

924
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,680
understand it so it's just it's a

925
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,540
Hands-On thing and that's true for

926
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,680
everything that we're working through

927
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,720
our infrastructure as code our students

928
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,880
pull down they work on the app Dev is

929
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,920
code LOL anything that I'm working on in

930
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,800
terms of new applications join me I'll

931
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,480
break something out into a micro service

932
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,820
totally Sovereign and you can work on

933
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,960
that part

934
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,820
and if I have to work around the fact

935
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,839
that you know you're going to be in

936
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,220
school it's going to take you six months

937
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,800
to do what might take me six days no

938
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,839
problem I'll work around that and I'll

939
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,579
include I'll Loop you back in as soon as

940
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,800
I can I mentioned querying and hunting

941
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,780
as code

942
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,020
devops uh it's so funny so um Mr Lambert

943
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,700
Mr West Lambert who just presented here

944
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,579
had a picture of Steve Urkel and did I

945
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,320
do that when he mentioned devops and I

946
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
was this close to putting a picture of

947
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,220
myself as Steve Urkel from Halloween on

948
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,460
here and that I had a WWE MDD moment I

949
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,359
was like you know what would Mark

950
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,900
Baggett do would he make a change

951
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,119
five minutes before he went live I don't

952
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,859
know and I chose against it but I you

953
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,839
know maybe he'll tell me afterwards if

954
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,260
that's the case but no uh we are

955
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,780
constantly trying to roll out more and

956
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,900
more uh devops environment stuff and we

957
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,520
always include them as a part of it

958
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,560
they're learning how to do pull requests

959
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,660
as some of the full-time not only in our

960
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,160
sock but elsewhere are learning how to

961
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,800
do it we treat them as first class so

962
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,260
that they're getting educated uh as

963
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,000
Hands-On as can be

964
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,339
but as Robert said some of that manual

965
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,420
work

966
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,180
ain't got to be manual work when I came

967
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,820
into this thing I said straight up

968
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,040
humans do human work computers do

969
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,440
computer work and we've got to put our

970
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,420
nose in the air sometimes and separate

971
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,640
the two we've got to recognize that

972
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,740
while there may be we are a state agency

973
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,180
and there may be people who've been

974
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,820
working on this one thing for

975
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,980
10 years and it's their one kind of

976
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,320
manual job we've got to be able to go in

977
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,820
there and say

978
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,460
sorry I can write a python script and

979
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,099
knock this out you know in seconds and

980
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,099
and that's good because humans can do

981
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,780
such a higher level of cognitive work

982
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,579
that now we can use your skill set

983
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,800
elsewhere automation is a great thing

984
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,599
automation is not about taking away jobs

985
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,460
not about taking away positions it's

986
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,900
about allowing you to do the things

987
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,240
you're actually passionate about if I

988
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,920
can get you out of excel I bet everybody

989
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,240
in here would be happy to hear that

990
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,460
right like nobody really maybe there's

991
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,640
one or two of you I apologize I you know

992
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,440
not me

993
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,480
um but some of that is some of the

994
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,619
automation we're working through right

995
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,760
the right enrichment again there's

996
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,839
cortex

997
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,820
which is great but we

998
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,460
uh we do it in other ways as well right

999
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,839
we're not disparaging tools in the

1000
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,040
slightest but we have to be able to do

1001
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,960
that as Robert said when the alert comes

1002
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,520
in and all that is already be there

1003
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,579
and it should uh historical data again

1004
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,260
building some of the context that Robert

1005
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,119
talked about with measurements and

1006
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,280
metrics we should be able to automate a

1007
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,760
lot of those processes so again we think

1008
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,320
of humans as being narrative creatures

1009
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,119
that first image is the slide that

1010
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,920
Robert's showing with the hive and

1011
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,720
underneath it is some of the work that

1012
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,180
we're working through that just provides

1013
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,119
more context automatically I showed the

1014
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,700
play school Fisher Price phone don't sue

1015
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,880
me uh but

1016
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,040
some of that can be challenging for a

1017
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,720
student in the high or in the hive

1018
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,879
because the hive does

1019
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,800
it's built for engineers and some of

1020
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,540
these students as Robert said literally

1021
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,760
are coming from Chick-fil-A and then

1022
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,960
that's what they're doing they don't

1023
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,599
have any familiarity so how can I as the

1024
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,880
engineer abstract some of that away and

1025
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,920
make it one button click how can I

1026
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,960
abstract some of that detail away and

1027
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,540
make it as narrative as it's possible so

1028
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,780
much so that our goal

1029
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,839
is to make it totally narrative for them

1030
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:09,960
to be able to read one or two sentences

1031
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,660
quick paragraph that explains exactly

1032
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,119
what's going on to give them context as

1033
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,400
quickly as possible so we're moving

1034
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,520
towards that and it takes automation to

1035
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,040
get there so

1036
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,960
hopefully all that's pretty clear but

1037
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,820
that's our ultimate goal

1038
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,320
and

1039
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,200
this is not just in our sock so I don't

1040
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,339
know what kind of environments you guys

1041
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:35,460
have but we have a network team we have

1042
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,500
a firewall team we have an

1043
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,859
infrastructure teams and

1044
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:43,680
what can we do with them how can we

1045
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,359
incorporate everything we just talked

1046
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,220
about with them

1047
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,859
so that we can reduce some of the volume

1048
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:51,839
of alerts and alarms that we're getting

1049
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,180
on our side and help them become more

1050
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,280
efficient in the process and so we

1051
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,079
include them along with the ride when we

1052
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,900
try new things we always they bring us

1053
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,020
in when they're looking at changing

1054
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,400
their processes and it's just this uh

1055
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,079
symbiotic relationship right Synergy as

1056
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,839
they said in the year 2000 uh between

1057
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,359
all of us and it helps to just save time

1058
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,520
it saves money it saves energy it saves

1059
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,400
effort and

1060
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,280
incorporating the process ultimately

1061
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,560
saves all of us headaches and that's the

1062
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,119
goal that's the key so we're everything

1063
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,380
we're talking about doing with the

1064
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,420
students we continue to do as well with

1065
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,900
our full-time outside of the sock

1066
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,820
and I will pass it back to Mr Wilson

1067
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,140
get all this stuff on properly all right

1068
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,859
so that's a lot of stuff and hopefully

1069
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:53,280
some of it y'all can think about and

1070
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,320
either take back to your environments

1071
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,880
and

1072
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,980
figure out whether or not some of that

1073
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,140
is applicable to you I think the part

1074
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,240
part of really what we want to reinforce

1075
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,420
is that a lot of this

1076
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,960
started to sound like doing

1077
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,500
SRE work and devops stuff with the

1078
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,800
security Con in in a security context

1079
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,460
and once we came to that conclusion we

1080
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,160
started more or less going to town and

1081
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,040
looking at everything you know what oh

1082
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,480
that sounds like something that you

1083
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,240
should actually have a repo for that's

1084
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,980
just something that somebody's right you

1085
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,220
know like documentation or

1086
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,960
detections all that kind of stuff but

1087
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,320
what that causes also is for you to

1088
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,119
think about the entirety of a life cycle

1089
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,700
of processes and how do you track

1090
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,440
something from the beginning to the end

1091
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,660
how do you know when when whether or not

1092
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,079
you're getting value or not from them

1093
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:54,359
all that kind of thing and then the

1094
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:57,780
other big one is abstracting the person

1095
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,420
out of the process as much as you can

1096
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,940
and that's what we're talking about with

1097
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,940
formalized guidance and creating systems

1098
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,319
so that Jonathan can take some time off

1099
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,160
and you know Jonathan can teach more

1100
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,400
people

1101
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,800
via the this framework and these tools

1102
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,319
than he could if he just sat down and

1103
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,940
asked somebody what is it that you want

1104
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,099
to learn about

1105
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:29,099
um the other things that I want to say

1106
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:32,520
is to just please don't overlook people

1107
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,680
at the beginning of their career

1108
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,160
and don't yep

1109
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,720
um they you uh Andrew Thompson from

1110
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,040
mandiant

1111
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,220
on Twitter the other day said posted

1112
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,319
something about what is it that you are

1113
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,119
the most proud of

1114
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,819
and tons of security people you know

1115
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:56,520
responding about all kind of reasons or

1116
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,599
whatever

1117
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,480
and for us it's the students that are

1118
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,760
coming out of our our program because

1119
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,800
this is a massive

1120
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,520
uh need in the industry but it's more

1121
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,040
than that it's that you're respecting

1122
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,540
people in the beginning of their career

1123
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,460
making sure that they're getting all the

1124
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,960
all the stuff that they need to be a

1125
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,800
success and all of that kind of thing so

1126
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Chris Sanders isn't here I don't believe

1127
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,859
but I wanted to also give a quick shout

1128
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:29,160
out to the rural Tech fund so all of us

1129
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,000
are from rural places in South Carolina

1130
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,520
we're all engineers and the work that

1131
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,640
the rural Tech fund is doing is helping

1132
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,599
that

1133
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,440
those kids all over the United States so

1134
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,160
if you don't contribute to that maybe

1135
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,660
consider consider doing that

1136
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,440
so I guess we can do some questions I

1137
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,880
don't know about timing or yeah okay uh

1138
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,240
Josh

1139
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,540
yeah some of them some of them are

1140
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,760
computer science students and some of

1141
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,099
them aren't so the majority of them are

1142
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:17,160
either computer science or what we call

1143
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,800
Integrated information technology which

1144
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,020
is kind of like the old whatever it was

1145
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,079
called Mis kind of stuff so basically

1146
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,359
the people that don't do data structures

1147
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,940
and algorithm analysis those those

1148
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,740
people

1149
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,420
these are people that have expressed

1150
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,780
interest in doing yeah so we that's a

1151
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,420
combination of things so we recruit

1152
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:43,319
we go and talk to classes but we a lot

1153
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:46,859
of it is by word of mouth and then we

1154
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:49,680
talk to high school teachers that

1155
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,160
especially people that um

1156
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,460
Mentor cyber Patriot and and stuff like

1157
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,920
that to say to see because we really

1158
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,740
want people to start in a sock when

1159
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,380
they're freshmen so by the time that by

1160
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,119
the time that they graduate they're you

1161
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,980
know they go to work wherever they want

1162
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,680
to you make 150 000 or whatever

1163
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,359
um that that's kind of the goal

1164
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:15,319
but I mean I so I have an English degree

1165
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:18,060
uh one of the one of the sharpest people

1166
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,099
that we have right now everybody is

1167
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:22,440
sharp but one of the sharpest people

1168
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,780
that we have uh he he's getting an

1169
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,040
English degree also

1170
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,779
in anybody yep

1171
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,859
yeah we we do have a competition say the

1172
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:42,660
question was do we have a competition

1173
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,500
teams for like CTF kind of stuff

1174
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,260
yes yeah so that's all handled through

1175
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,140
our College of Engineering and computing

1176
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,060
um so what what we end up doing with

1177
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,780
that is we we are somewhat hands off

1178
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,460
with that process

1179
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,200
because their computer science

1180
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,940
professors so to get back to the

1181
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,859
politics stuff they are computer science

1182
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,020
professors that would that have an

1183
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,119
interest in that and they tend to be

1184
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,640
more involved in that part

1185
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,920
um but yeah we we help them as needed

1186
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,700
more more or less

1187
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,359
yeah that that happens sometimes

1188
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:25,200
um

1189
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,420
it's strange and that's something that

1190
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,020
we we could do a lot better job at with

1191
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,579
making sure that everybody knows what

1192
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:34,380
all kind of opportunities there are at

1193
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,540
the University so there may be some kids

1194
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,460
that have gone through those teams that

1195
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,780
don't even know that they can even work

1196
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,880
in the sock so that that's the kind of

1197
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,160
stuff that we are continuing to work on

1198
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,460
um so we're exploring hiring an academic

1199
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,280
so the the issue with that is in order

1200
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,520
to get credit you need to have somebody

1201
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,020
that can be a instructor you know or a

1202
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,599
professor or whatever and unfortunately

1203
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:10,020
a GSE doesn't qualify you

1204
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,460
um you know so we while we can teach

1205
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,359
people how to do stuff we you know we we

1206
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,040
don't have we don't have the creds we

1207
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,440
don't have the academic creds to to to

1208
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,300
do that part

1209
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,359
um so we we're actually considering

1210
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,700
hiring someone for for that exact reason

1211
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
s

1212
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,579
yeah we have to say we end up doing both

1213
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:53,400
we'll do formalized

1214
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,520
we do formalized meetings you know so

1215
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,740
and that kind of stuff happens more

1216
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,079
often Pro in the summer

1217
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,420
um and and actually this past summer we

1218
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,160
mentored people through doing Security

1219
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,040
Plus because it's relatively inexpensive

1220
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,640
cert and all that kind of stuff so we'll

1221
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,560
set up you know like an hour we'll spend

1222
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,200
on networking an hour we'll spend on uh

1223
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,000
Cloud resources all that kind of stuff

1224
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,300
but then that what Jonathan and Alex

1225
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,099
were talking about about getting the

1226
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:26,099
curriculum to them as as close to the

1227
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,480
person as possible

1228
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,700
we do that all through

1229
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,720
a an analyst workstation that pulls down

1230
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,000
stuff

1231
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,800
markdown

1232
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,420
that their the students actually also

1233
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,819
work on that gets pulled to them so

1234
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:43,260
we'll say all right we're going to look

1235
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,480
at this we're going to look at this and

1236
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,640
then we interact with them all day more

1237
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,700
or less via teams and then so what will

1238
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,500
happen will be there an incident will

1239
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,359
come up and we'll say all right we're

1240
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,800
going to go through this everybody get

1241
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,440
on the call and somebody will will go

1242
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,020
through it with them

1243
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,020
okay

1244
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,140
[Music]

1245
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,180
and that's the mindset that we have so

1246
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,460
representative work on the

1247
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,980
murderer didn't stop at all everything

1248
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,440
they work on the technical they pretty

1249
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,339
much can also

1250
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,740
just to

1251
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,220
director

1252
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:49,699
[Music]

1253
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:52,740
to formalize the user's brain which is

1254
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,510
heating it into the pond of what we do

1255
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,809
[Music]

1256
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,380
okay

1257
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,819
so I think

1258
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:07,200
three

1259
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,020
we have a lot of

1260
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,119
versus stuff like that your challenge

1261
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:13,920
was allowing students

1262
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,460
honors

1263
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,900
yeah so we don't monitor student

1264
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,220
Networks

1265
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,380
so that that's how we get around that we

1266
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,119
don't want to monitor student networks

1267
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,180
so back at the beginning where we run

1268
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,720
our own ISP the ISP is only monitored If

1269
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,579
the Fed send us a notice

1270
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:38,540
so if that happens it gets monitored

1271
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,780
otherwise it's wild west so the students

1272
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,380
the students monitor students in terms

1273
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,359
of let's say there's an impossible

1274
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:51,420
travel alert and you know some student

1275
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,220
mailbox gets popped or whatever in a

1276
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,040
synonym fish stuff but not down to you

1277
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,619
content or their machines or in any of

1278
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:01,099
that kind of stuff

1279
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:05,789
[Applause]
