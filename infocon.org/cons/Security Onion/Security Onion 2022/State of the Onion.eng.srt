I'm going to tell some dad jokes I'm not

31
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,680
[Applause]

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,500
that was stolen from my good friend and

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,960
hero Mr David Bianco who told that right

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,880
up here just a couple of years ago so

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,799
thank you Dave

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,579
all right

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,200
y'all just keep that energy up we're

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,880

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,100
okay

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,200
so of course again I want to say thank

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,540
you to my SOS family for all of the work

42
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,700
over the last 12 months that led up to

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,540
this day greatly appreciate it

44
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,759
and as Phil mentioned earlier we do want

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,560
to say thank you to the rural technology

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,239
fund and I think one of the talks this

47
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,400
morning also mentioned them they're

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,700
doing just tremendous work in getting

49
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,959
technology into rural areas and this is

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,400
something that I am personally

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,680
passionate about when I was growing up I

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,260
lived on a little bitty dirt road my

53
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,520
address was rural to Rural Route 2 Box

54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,760
52a right so I was not in the city I was

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,860
on a little dirt road and if it weren't

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,040
for technology right who knows where I

57
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,260
would be so I'm passionate about this

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,980
and as Phil mentioned we take all of the

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,739
proceeds from our book sales and yes

60
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,260
we've sold more than five but we take

61
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,060
all of the proceeds of those Book Sales

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,800
and we donate them to the rural

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,560
technology fund and I'm pleased to

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,660
announce that this year in addition to

65
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,480
that donation we're going above and

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,000
beyond with an additional ten thousand

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,340
dollars for the rural technology fund

68
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,560
so thank you to all of you who have

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,420
purchased books that have helped with

70
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,500
that donation and we you know we greatly

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,800
encourage you if you haven't already

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,420
given your own personal donation to The

73
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,720
RTF please consider doing so it's a very

74
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,680
worthy cause

75
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,099
all right now for something

76
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,200
completely different

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,300
are you ready

78
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,360
who here has played golf

79
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,760
well that's not enough hands we can

80
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,220
count Putt-Putt okay that should be just

81
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,000
about everybody all right okay

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,400
so it is confession time I would like to

83
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,280
confess something to you all

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,739
I am not what you would call a great

85
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,599
golfer

86
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,780
I'm not even an average golfer in fact I

87
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,040
am a bad golfer Bryant has seen me play

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,140
he knows

89
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,360
so I don't have the skill of Tiger Woods

90
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,040
and I certainly don't have the fashion

91
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,180
sense of John Daly

92
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,160
when I send tea time invitations to

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,940
Happy Gilmore he simply refuses them

94
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,639
and I can't even say no no no no no like

95
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,600
Chevy Chase in Caddyshack

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,080
great movie right so what did I do I

97
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
went out and bought some Hardware so I

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,759
bought this Garmin launch monitor and I

99
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,460
bought a practice net so that I can hit

100
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,280
golf balls in my backyard because I

101
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,840
ain't got time to go to the golf course

102
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,759
or the driving range

103
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,560
I just need to be able to get out in my

104
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,419
backyard and practice for 15 or 30

105
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,680
minutes

106
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,020
but here's the problem

107
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,600
when you're as bad as I am even if

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,160
you're only eight feet away from that

109
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,840
net some of your shots just totally

110
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,759
missed the net altogether

111
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,639
so when you send a real golf ball flying

112
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,440
over your fence towards your neighbor's

113
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,960
house you're having a bad day so then I

114
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,940
had to invest in like practice golf

115
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,880
balls so I wouldn't break windows so I

116
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,340
bought some Hardware

117
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,380
then I installed the software for the

118
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,259
Garmin launch monitor

119
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,220
and what happened next

120
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,400
absolutely terrified me

121
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,680
I saw my horrendous swing for the first

122
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,699
time

123
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,580
it recorded me I looked at the video and

124
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,280
I saw how bad my swing was

125
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,840
kind of like a cross between Charles

126
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,639
Barkley

127
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,100
who's a great basketball player but was

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,280
a horrible golfer

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,479
and look like this guy

130
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,419
I just love that like

131
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,840
I can watch that over and over and over

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,280
again

133
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,840
it's hypnotic isn't it

134
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,000
so I figure you know Charles Barkley

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,039
that was his old swing he eventually got

136
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,960
fed up and you know he took some real

137
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,520
lessons from a real Pro and he got

138
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,039
better I figured if Charles Barkley can

139
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,100
get better well hey so can I

140
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,880
so I studied those video recordings

141
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,460
so that I could find my swing flaws and

142
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,419
fix them

143
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,199
then I use the flight data to verify

144
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,000
that those swing fixes were actually

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,080
working

146
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,520
and guess what I actually got better

147
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
not a whole lot better but you know

148
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,919
better than I was

149
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,960
so now you all are sitting there saying

150
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
Doug what in the world does this have to

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,819
do with security onion

152
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,560
we're waiting

153
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,319
well I'm going somewhere with this if

154
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,960
you have the right Hardware

155
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
and the right software

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,360
and you respond correctly to the data

157
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,479
they provide you can improve your

158
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,500
situation

159
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,960
this goes for not only golf

160
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,900
but hey incident response threat hunting

161
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,380
the kind of things that we do

162
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,900

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,340
and then last year we announced our

171
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,060
response ready line right for especially

172
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,919
military folks who need to do emergency

173
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,259
incident response hop on a plane put it

174
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,199
in the overhead bin so these things are

175
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,880
portable but incredibly powerful

176
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,560
now of course lots of folks are moving

177
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,240
to the cloud so we've got the right

178
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,039
hardware for the cloud as well if you're

179
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,680
in AWS we do have an Ami if you're in

180
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,340
Azure we have an image there as well

181
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,319
so that's the right Hardware what about

182
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,780
the right software well of course you

183
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,940
know in terms of downloads we are

184
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,340
currently at are you ready for this

185
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,620
two million one hundred sixty three

186
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,440
thousand six hundred thirty four

187
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,539
that's quite a few downloads I'm

188
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:22,979
impressed

189
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,240
so

190
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,580
how have we improved the software since

191
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,440
last year well

192
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,819
we've been busy

193
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,860
so here we go

194
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,679
we added multi-factor Authentication

195
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,380
so you make your software even more

196
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,200
secure by requiring that MFA code from

197
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,719
Google auth or whatever provider you

198
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,240
have now there is a QR code there that's

199
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,779
my personal QR code I would ask that you

200
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,500
not scan my QR code please pretty please

201
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,839
I mean you could scan it if you want to

202
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,620
but I would really recommend against it

203
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,660
do you hear what I'm saying like you

204
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,880
really you probably should not scan that

205
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
QR code and if you do

206
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,779
you should you should probably have your

207
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,760
volume all the way down

208
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,680
but you probably shouldn't scan the QR

209
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,860
code you went for it you went for it yes

210
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,459
got him

211
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:21,600
there it is well played sir

212
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,279
all right

213
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,279
so MFA we added MFA

214
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,000
check the box

215
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,339
next we added case management directly

216
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,339
in security onion console right so you

217
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,040
can go directly from alerts or from your

218
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,800
hunting or from what have you create a

219
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,560
case escalate data to the case

220
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,080
collaborate with your team as you work

221
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,180
to close that case

222
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,940
as you're adding artifacts to the case

223
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,860
you create indicators you can then

224
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,500
analyze those using our built-in

225
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,899
analyzers so the team has been working

226
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,220
incredibly hard on MFA cases analyzers

227
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,100
and oh by the way we've talked about a

228
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,399
couple of times today dashboards

229
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,019
right we originally had this thing

230
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,600
called hunt which was really great

231
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,740
but we decided to take it up yet another

232
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,740
notch right because with hunt we could

233
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,980
do an arbitrary group Buy on any old

234
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,500
random field and that was nice right but

235
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,300
we want to be able to build an entire

236
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,940
dashboard we want to have multiple

237
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,060
Fields being visualized on the same page

238
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,160
so

239
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,019
you know eventually this just came to be

240
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,240
a priority and I sat down and I built

241
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,880
the proof of concept and

242
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,500
shared it with the rest of the team they

243
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,120
gave me feedback on it we iterated

244
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,459
finally turned it over to Jason erdel

245
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,279
who's our amazing vice president of

246
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,680
software engineering and he took all of

247
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,540
my horrible code and replaced it with

248
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,899
his good code and then he came back and

249
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,360
showed me his version and I said that's

250
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,399
amazing it's so much better than my

251
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
version and he's like but I want to do

252
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,060
one last thing

253
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,019
to really like push it up over the top

254
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,160
and I said well you know

255
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,480
there's this thing called a Sand Key

256
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,620
diagram

257
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,660
and they're really cool we should add

258
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,459
Sand Key diagrams

259
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,100
so Jason said

260
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,800
challenge accepted

261
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,800
five hours later we had Sand Key

262
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,820
diagrams because he's that amazing

263
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,339
and so you know we get lots of

264
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,620
compliments on our Sand Key diagrams

265
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,360
to which we say

266
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,579
thank you thank you very much

267
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,859
you knew it was coming didn't you yeah

268
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,959
who writes these things anyway

269
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,180
oh it's me

270
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,399
make note to self hire new writers

271
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,600
we also added the intrusion detection

272
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,779
Honeypot we talked about this previously

273
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,220
this is pretty amazing stuff you can

274
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,899
very quickly

275
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,060
spin out new intrusion detection

276
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,000
Honeypot nodes to your Enterprise and

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,800
then when an attacker gets on the inside

278
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,240
of your Enterprise and he starts

279
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,640
scanning around he'll find these

280
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,920
strange looking IP addresses and they

281
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,420
might have like a web server sitting

282
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,740
there and he might connect and see

283
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,480
something like this and he might go oh

284
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,820
that's interesting and try to put in a

285
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,860
username and password and then that

286
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,160
generates alerts and you say aha I got

287
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,060
you

288
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,319
so that's pretty cool stuff

289
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,760
we also added a new receiver node type

290
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,160
this helps you to build a more scalable

291
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,940
more enterprisey deployment

292
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,519
but we weren't done then we then

293
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,220
improved the analyst Workstation

294
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,100
uh it's now even more powerful it works

295
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,500
better in air gap environments it joins

296
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,019
into your distributed deployment so it

297
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,120
kind of understands the CA and the

298
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,639
certificates and all that good stuff

299
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,220
we also updated to elastic eight this

300
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,820
was a massive undertaking uh and uh we

301
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,220
made it so it was well worth all the

302
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,519
effort

303
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,519
recently we added an advanced toggle for

304
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,339
alerts and cases right so inside of

305
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,500
security onion console we have the

306
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,779
alerts app and we have the cases app and

307
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,399
both of those have kind of a simplified

308
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,920
interface by default but we said you

309
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,500
know wouldn't it be nice if you had kind

310
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,120
of that additional power at your

311
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,220
fingertips to slice and dice all of this

312
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,560
data so if you need that you just pop

313
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,440
into options and you click that toggle

314
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,660
for temporarily enabling the advanced

315
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,579
interface features and you're good to go

316
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,839
so our team has been working incredibly

317
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,420
hard over the past year to bring you all

318
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,180
of those amazing features and oh by the

319
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,800
way we talked about the right Hardware

320
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,860
before you know when folks buy our

321
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,180
appliances or sign up for our Amazon Ami

322
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,480
whatever all of those products then help

323
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,760
us to support and maintain the software

324
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,860
right so when you purchase appliances

325
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,680
from us you're helping to add new

326
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,540
features to the software

327
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,060
and all of that sort of brings us to

328
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,420
today

329
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,540
I'd like to announce that security onion

330
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,519
23170 drops right now

331
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,000
and that's going to include Zeke 409

332
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,820
elastic 841

333
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,180
and as uh are the gentleman spoke about

334
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,760
earlier some improved dashboard and

335
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,699
hunting for sysmon data right so great

336
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,199
job guys on that

337
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,120
Phil talked about the book at Amazon so

338
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,639
you can actually scratch out that top

339
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,860
headline there you don't have to wait

340
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,420
till next week you can actually order it

341
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,279
right now and it will be delivered to

342
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,560
your door next week so just go to

343
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,139
security onion.net book you can order

344
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,480
your copy your purchase will be a part

345
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,199
of next year's RTF donation

346
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,660
and that book does include a discount

347
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,300
code for our online training and also

348
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,440
the socp certification so

349
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,420
go and get a book you get a discount

350
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,399
code for the certification

351
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,860
you pass the certification exam and then

352
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,839
you too can say

353
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,220
I'm a security onion certified

354
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,199
professional I'm kind of a big deal

355
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,260
but of course

356
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,120
there is always

357
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,500
one

358
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,360
last

359
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,959
thing

360
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,579
so if you've ever been on a golf course

361
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,899
and you hear

362
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,279
you know

363
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,339
that they're trying to tell you heads up

364
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,240
something is coming

365
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,339
ladies and gentlemen something

366
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,500
is coming

367
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,279
security onion 2.4

368
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,180
version 2.4

369
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,360
is in development now

370
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,899
it builds on the success of 2.3

371
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,720
it's easier to install configure and

372
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,160
maintain

373
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,260
it's more powerful but at the same time

374
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,720
it's more streamlined

375
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,300
so let's talk about the specs

376
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,519
our ISO image is going to be based on

377
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
Rocky Linux 9.

378
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,480
we're moving up in the world

379
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,339
we're going to also support Ubuntu 2204

380
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:39,899
our distributed deployments are going to

381
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,120
use elastic clustering

382
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,519
and we are going to support the elastic

383
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,320
agent

384
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,100
there you go

385
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,060
we'll talk more about that in a minute I

386
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,399
think you're going to like it

387
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,740
and sock includes even more features

388
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,600
this is where things get fun

389
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,339
all right so in Security on your console

390
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,799
we have this thing called The Grid

391
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,419
previously in the grid you could open

392
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,099
this thing up and you would see the node

393
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,199
status and you'd see Appliance images if

394
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,540
you bought the appliances from us now

395
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,980
you're going to see container status

396
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,619
right so instead of having to drop to a

397
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,559
command line and run sudo so hyphen

398
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,260
status you just pop into grid and there

399
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,299
it is right if a container is running

400
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,839
it'll let you know if not then it lets

401
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,040
you know about that as well now in

402
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,320
addition to that you'll also see kind of

403
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,440
in the lower left of the node status

404
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,960
panel there's a little icon there

405
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,520
and let's see can I zoom in

406
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,520
it says view node metrics so if you

407
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,900
click on this

408
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,179
we might actually see this in a demo in

409
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,980
a few minutes if you're interested but

410
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,600
if you click on that link it actually

411
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,539
takes you directly to grafana directly

412
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,120
to the grafana dashboard for that

413
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,460
particular node right so if you've got

414
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,220
10 100 nodes makes it a whole lot easier

415
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,740
to get from grid over to grafana to see

416
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,900
what services failed or the history of

417
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,799
that particular service

418
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,960
now next up in terms of improvements to

419
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,760
security onion console

420
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,460
we have the users page

421
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,919
traditionally you could go to this page

422
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,799
you could see your list of users but we

423
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,960
took it up another notch

424
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,059
so now you can edit users

425
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,160
so you can go in and change username

426
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,419
password

427
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,940
roles things like that you can lock the

428
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,559
user account you can delete the user

429
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,480
account you can add new users everything

430
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,880
you would expect to do in a user

431
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,640
management panel

432
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,100
we also have a new page called grid

433
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,380
members the idea here is that if you

434
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,240
have a distributed deployment you've got

435
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,460
a manager some search nodes some forward

436
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,220
nodes maybe at some point you need to

437
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,020
decommission a node right so you could

438
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,700
go into grid members and you could click

439
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,280
on the member click on the review button

440
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,039
and then delete it if you add a new

441
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,080
member to your Grid it's going to show

442
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,720
up on the left side maybe under pending

443
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,700
members and then you can click a button

444
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,340
to accept that member into the grid

445
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,500
right so again trying to get you away

446
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,419
from the command line and help you to

447
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:16,500
stay

448
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,980
in the comfy web interface

449
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,840
so there's your grid member page where

450
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,419
you can delete a grid member if

451
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,780
necessary

452
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,740
we also have a new page called

453
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,780
configuration this is where things get

454
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,100
really interesting

455
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,240
right

456
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,880
so instead of having to SSH into a box

457
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,100
and Fiddle around and config files why

458
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,740
not just do that from the web interface

459
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,480
right so

460
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,660
you go into config maybe you go to BPF

461
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,419
and pcapp and you put in notport 443 and

462
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,919
you click apply and you're done right

463
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,980
it's as easy as that

464
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,480
there's also a button so you can

465
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,860
synchronize your grid and that

466
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,380
essentially tells salt to update all of

467
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,660
the states on the box and so that makes

468
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,880
it a lot easier again to stay away from

469
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,600
the command line

470
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,880
now let's talk about elastic agent this

471
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,799
is going to be our recommended agent

472
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,360
it's going to give you comprehensive

473
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,780
Telemetry and also live response

474
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,580
capabilities

475
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,400
we will have a dedicated elastic agent

476
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,260
node option

477
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,780
and it will run log stash so that you

478
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,700
won't have to expose elasticsearch to

479
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,320
all of your endpoints right if you think

480
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,660
about it you might want to maybe have

481
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,059
laptops out on the internet and so maybe

482
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,160
you want a node sitting in your DMZ to

483
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,440
collect logs from those agents well you

484
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,820
don't necessarily want elasticsearch

485
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,640
sitting out there so let's do log stash

486
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,919
and so we'll have all of that in an easy

487
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,160
to use configuration option for you

488
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,020
we've even taken it to the next level

489
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,600
and built a custom agent wrapper that

490
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,400
takes that native agent and makes it

491
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,320
even easier to deploy

492
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,559
so when you go into Cabana you would

493
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,799
then be able to run a live query

494
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,679
and if you'll notice

495
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,179
we've got a little thing down here that

496
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,280
says View and so hunt

497
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,140
so when you get the results of that and

498
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,700
you click that link

499
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,860
that takes you right into hunt shows you

500
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,320
the results of that so you could kind of

501
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,340
like what Bryant was talking about

502
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,440
earlier search for a particular md5

503
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,840
across all of your endpoints you get the

504
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,880
the results of that live query right and

505
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,559
Hunt right in just a few seconds

506
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,539
we talked about my documentation earlier

507
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,100
and we're going to make that integration

508
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,679
even better especially for folks in

509
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,620
air-gapped environments if you are in an

510
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,419
air gap environment today you may have

511
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,100
noticed that we do have a copy of the

512
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,500
documentation built into security onion

513
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,020
console but it's kind of a simplified

514
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,780
version of the documentation so instead

515
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,820
of multiple Pages it's really just a

516
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,340
single HTML page it's a little bit

517
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,159
awkward today so we're fixing all that

518
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,020
right we're going to give you a full

519
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,940
version of the documentation built into

520
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,740
security engine console

521
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,860
are the full multi-page version

522
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,900
and the search functionality will

523
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,460
actually work for airgap users it

524
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,080
doesn't work today but it will in the

525
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,059
next version

526
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,799
and in addition to that when you're in

527
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,159
security engine console like in that

528
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,260
nice new configuration app that we just

529
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,659
looked at there will be specific pages

530
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,159
that will have a blue question mark and

531
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,480
if you click on that it'll take you

532
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,940
directly to the documentation for that

533
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,299
particular functionality

534
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,100
and so this is what the search looks

535
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,500
like even on an air gap Network search

536
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,120
is going to work great for that Internal

537
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,480
Documentation

538
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,100
so let's talk about the transition from

539
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,620
2.3 to 2.4

540
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,980
when we release 2.4 we will announce an

541
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,780
end of life date for 2.3

542
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,039
and 2.3 will continue to receive

543
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,260
security patches and priority bug fixes

544
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,039
until it reaches that end of life date

545
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,539
so now the question on your minds is

546
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:07,080
when can we try security onion 2.4

547
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,580
well you know we're the kind of people

548
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,400
that we like to under promise and over

549
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,480
deliver

550
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,919
so

551
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,980
the beta is coming soon we're not going

552
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,419
to give you a date just yet but it's

553
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,179
coming soon okay so get ready when it

554
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:22,740
does drop

555
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,320
we'd ask that you try it out right kick

556
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,480
the tires let us know how it goes give

557
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,000
us feedback the more feedback we get

558
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,980
during beta the quicker we can get the

559
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,780
final release out the door

560
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,240
right so we want to get there as quickly

561
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,860
as possible so

562
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,340
we are asking for your feedback

563
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,879
so

564
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,039
would you like to see a demo

565
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,879
are you sure

566
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,320
because this is like pre-alpha stuff

567
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,900
folks it could break it could it could

568
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,460
die in a fire

569
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,520
yes that's what David wants to see Burn

570
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,080
It to the Ground

571
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,720
all right well well listen if the demo

572
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,360
Burns I'm holding you all responsible

573
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,340
okay this is your fault

574
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,419
all right so here's security onion 2.4.0

575
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,100
so we do have our normal alerts page as

576
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,679
you've come to love you can do all your

577
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,179
cool stuff here you can drill into

578
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,880
alerts you can acknowledge alerts you

579
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,220
can escalate alerts to cases you can

580
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,799
pivot to full packet capture you can

581
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,960
correlate and alert and that takes you

582
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,120
over to hunt and that gives you all the

583
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,919
logs that are correlated to that

584
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,419
particular alert

585
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,480
so that's good stuff

586
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,880
we still have dashboards we love our

587
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,580
dashboards especially our senky diagrams

588
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,679
that's going to continue to be a thing

589
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,240
in 2.4

590
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,100
so

591
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,780
all that stuff works the same way that

592
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,940
you expect it to hunt still works the

593
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,159
same way

594
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,919
cases you can still create cases add

595
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,679
artifacts to cases take those indicators

596
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,539
and run analyzers on them do what you

597
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,820
need to do close the case full packet

598
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,640
capture still the same

599
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,679
grid is where it gets cool this is where

600
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,200
the changes are so if I drill into this

601
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,400
particular node

602
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,380
here I can see my container status

603
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,159
you see these things are running they've

604
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,860
been up for a while now

605
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,720
and then this button is what we talked

606
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,039
about earlier

607
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,020
so this is for viewing the node metrics

608
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,539
so imagine if I had 10 sensors 100

609
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,960
sensors you know I might have just one

610
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,940
out of them that was showing a fault or

611
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,640
some kind of an error so I drill this I

612
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,860
drill into that and I click that button

613
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,960
and that would take me over to my

614
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,539
grafana page

615
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,440
like that

616
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,120
and now I can use that grafana

617
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,520
information to diagnose what caused that

618
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,460
fault in the first place

619
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,960
all right so now we go down to

620
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,679
Administration we can go into users

621
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,159
we can drill into a user we can change

622
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,779
username first name last name we can

623
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,220
change their roles we could lock the

624
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,020
user account

625
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,760
just like that

626
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,919
we could delete the user account just

627
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,340
like that

628
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,600
we can go to grid members

629
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,700
if we were adding a new member to this

630
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,200
distributed deployment it would show up

631
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,179
under pending I could then click accept

632
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:31,860
and it would move over to the accepted

633
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,120
member's side

634
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,220
once it's there I can click review and I

635
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,659
can see the name the role the

636
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,960
fingerprint and if I need to I can click

637
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,400
delete and remove it from the grid

638
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,140
then we have configuration

639
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,120
and this is where lots of good stuff is

640
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,860
our guy's been working really really

641
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,960
hard on this particular feature

642
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,940
so you could drill into BPF you could go

643
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,659
to pcap you could put in not Port 443

644
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,820
you could apply that to your grid

645
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,460
and you can change the configuration for

646
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,100
things like elasticsearch grafana IDs

647
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,020
tools that's where you tune your rule

648
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,460
set

649
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,240
pcapp sorry Kata Zeke security onion

650
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,919
console itself

651
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,360
all right so here's where you can drill

652
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,760
in and modify your login Banner

653
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,340
or your overview page things like that

654
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,380
so again keeping you away from the

655
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,200
command line keeping you in a nice comfy

656
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,659
web interface for all of your

657
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,840
Administration needs

658
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,419
all right so now let's go over to OS

659
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,380
query manager

660
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,700
and put in my super secret credentials

661
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:54,440
all right so let's do a new live query

662
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,059
so all I need to do is Select my agents

663
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,940
now I can start running queries so maybe

664
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,500
I'll zoom in so you can see this a

665
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,799
little bit better

666
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,840
select star from users

667
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,360
now if I just submit that

668
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,980
so it's going to send that query out to

669
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,080
any agents that are connected of course

670
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,120
I only have one agent but you see the

671
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,000
results come back that fast

672
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,400
so now I have to do if I want to if I

673
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,620
really have a large data set here and I

674
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,539
want to do a lot of slicing and dicing

675
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,419
and maybe some arbitrary stacking of

676
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,580
random Fields maybe I want to click this

677
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,460
link to bring all that data into hunt

678
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,799
and now I've got all the capability that

679
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,679
I need to maybe drill into this

680
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,980
and maybe say well let's Group by

681
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,500
host architecture

682
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,960
right so when we do that

683
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,880
we get a new

684
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,559
addition to the table there for host

685
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,360
architecture

686
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,120
and it's just that easy right so you can

687
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,400
instantly run queries against all of

688
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,740
your agents you're going to have agents

689
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,659
on your distributed deployment itself

690
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,400
all the nodes in the deployment you

691
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,380
might add agents to your endpoints as

692
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,020
well to your laptops to your desktops to

693
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,179
your server infrastructure

694
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,340
and now you've got one place to do all

695
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,020
of your hunting all of your live

696
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,380
response it's all together the way that

697
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,860
you want it

698
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,179
did my microphone go out

699
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:35,779
I think the battery may be dead

700
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,720
so amazing

701
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,700
so I think it's it's the house mic right

702
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,860
here

703
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,500
there's a chance to get a dad

704
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,899
thank you

705
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,520
we good now

706
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,120
all right

707
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,720
and let me show you the docs since we

708
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,000
talked about that

709
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,039
so for example we can go into

710
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,039
configuration

711
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,520
so these configuration options are going

712
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,500
to have a blue question mark you click

713
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,299
that takes you to the documentation

714
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,640
built right in

715
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,679
and of course you could do a search for

716
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:25,559
BPF as well and that works just like you

717
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,840
would expect it to even on air gap

718
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,919
Networks

719
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,659
so for our

720
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:33,120
our loved ones on airgap networks we're

721
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,159
