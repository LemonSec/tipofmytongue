[Applause]

2
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,880
thank you

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,930
y'all for coming out today I know

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,730
there's a lot of ways you could spend

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,220
your Friday so I appreciate you spending

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,050
at least the next 30 45 minutes with

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,820
Steph and I we've got a lot of cool

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,840
stuff to talk about today the things

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,160
that you're going to see today you have

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,410
not seen before because it is all

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,668
original research we've gone out we put

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,930
some boots on the ground we've talked to

13
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,910
a lot of analysts done a lot of really

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,530
cool interviews and we're gonna share

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,690
the results of that today and release

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,629
the paper today that we've written along

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,269
these lines if you don't know me my name

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,190
is Chris Sanders run a company called

19
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:48,600
applied networking defense we focused on

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,570
information security training and

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,690
research particularly with investigators

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,129
and I also run a company called the

23
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,660
rural technology fund where we focus on

24
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,829
donating technology equipment and

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,529
scholarships to kids who are interested

26
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,420
in pursuing technical careers my

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,489
background is mostly in defense and

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,560
education work but I focus on the

29
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,180
training and the research and such now

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,810
and I've written a couple of books along

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,720
the way and those are pictured there my

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,880
name is Steph brand I am an IT and

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,340
cybersecurity student here at a custom

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,369
university my background is in clinical

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,159
psychology I'm finishing my internship

36
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,409
up with applied network defense and fun

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,310
step backs I am a former whitewater raft

38
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,990
guide she's at least 20 times more

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,460
hardcore than me as evidenced by that

40
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,780
picture pretty badass so I want you to

41
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,770
go ahead real quick and if you have some

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,840
to see a lot of you have your computer's

43
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,158
open good pull up a notepad document or

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,240
maybe get something to write on we're

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,530
gonna do a little bit of an exercise

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,059
here and I want to be able to write

47
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,030
stuff down it looks like a lot of you

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,119
are already ready that's good so we have

49
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,700
a investigation scenario we have kind of

50
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,020
an alert on the screen and the alert is

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,570
fairly straightforward not a lot of

52
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,000
details but the alert is such that you

53
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:07,679
have a system a Windows system on your

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,209
network and a process called update exe

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,340
has launched on that and that for

56
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,870
whatever reason is suspicious maybe just

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,640
because it is named update dot exe and

58
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,049
that is quite generic but that is

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,029
suspicious and you have to investigate

60
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:19,890
this so what I want you to do is I'm

61
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,110
going to give you two minutes no more

62
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,198
and I want you to write down a list of

63
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,269
the ways you might consider

64
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,740
investigating this alert it can be a

65
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:30,390
series of questions

66
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,130
it can be a series of investigative

67
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,140
paths if you need data sources you wanna

68
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,750
examine but take two minutes and write

69
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,220
down a list of ways you would

70
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,900
investigate this there are no wrong

71
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,890
answers for our purposes here so you

72
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,890
have two minutes to do that

73
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,580
about another minute

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,179
okay now again there are no real wrong

75
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,440
answers for our purpose here we're gonna

76
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,700
be using this list a few times

77
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,140
throughout the talk today but does

78
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:24,360
anybody want to share with me just maybe

79
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,260
one of the items on their list not

80
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,120
everybody wants to it looks like it

81
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,280
looks new hands does everybody somebody

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,870
close right here

83
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,580
what's the foul hash okay sure

84
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:39,540
right here what registry keys okay way

85
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,560
in the back Danny what process spawned

86
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,330
it very good so we got a lot of options

87
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,520
here I imagine a lot of you have things

88
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,080
on your list they were not said there's

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,419
a whole lot of ways you could go about

90
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,320
that I think for many of you even if you

91
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,090
only have a minimal amount of

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,890
investigative experience coming up with

93
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,869
at least a few items or a few ways you

94
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,490
would go about investigating that not

95
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,770
too insanely difficult given this

96
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,660
scenario however if I were to ask you

97
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,880
how you came up with the things on the

98
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,919
list I think that question is quite a

99
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,750
bit harder we're not very good all the

100
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,190
time in understanding our own processes

101
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,870
how do we come to the conclusions what

102
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,410
thought modes were using to think about

103
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,270
these complex things and that to some

104
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:33,270
degree is what we're going to talk about

105
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:35,780
today this is it's hard to put into

106
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,520
words it is very hard to put into words

107
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,580
even if you know a process extremely

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,289
well it can be very difficult to tell

109
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,599
someone how you're doing that process

110
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,640
step by step and if you don't completely

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,090
understand the process that makes it

112
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,979
even more challenging now the analyst

113
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,200
workflow can be summed up in a number of

114
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,120
different ways but I think the simplest

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,310
way to represent that is simply that you

116
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,990
have some form of input often it's

117
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,490
something like an alert and then you

118
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,810
work through an investigation you go out

119
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,950
and look at evidence and you build this

120
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,930
timeline of events that have occurred

121
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,419
and that gets you to a specific

122
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,490
conclusion and that kind of encapsulates

123
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,930
what we do now another way to say this

124
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,580
using a little bit different terminology

125
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,710
is this notion of perception and reality

126
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,820
we form this initial perception of

127
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,469
events that have occurred and they're

128
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,169
kind of nebulous all floating around and

129
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,629
we continue to assimilate

130
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:25,508
evidence add it to that perception and

131
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:28,219
eventually that forms one cohesive

132
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:30,650
percent reality of what actually

133
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:32,960
happened tangible events that have

134
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,609
occurred the top be alert to conclusion

135
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,289
is what we call the investigation

136
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,599
process there's a name for this

137
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:39,770
perception to reality thing too and it's

138
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,479
one you're all familiar with it's

139
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,520
learning that is how we learn and that's

140
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,169
how we generally learn anything so

141
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,669
there's something to be said for if we

142
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:48,650
want to understand how we do analysis

143
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,080
and how we do investigations we can

144
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,909
learn about that by learning about how

145
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,438
we learn if you understand how you learn

146
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:56,110
you're gonna understand better your own

147
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,919
thought process and how you do

148
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,339
investigations and I particularly think

149
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,609
that there's something to that really

150
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:03,409
now

151
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,259
another fancy word for learning is

152
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:08,089
cognition and a fancier word is

153
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,219
metacognition which is learning about

154
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:12,020
learning or specifically thinking about

155
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:13,520
thinking if you want to get better and

156
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,279
understanding your own thought processes

157
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,930
you have to be what they say is

158
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,789
metacognitively aware and there are two

159
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,620
components of that one is knowledge of

160
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,270
cognition so knowing how you think about

161
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,699
things and how you come to conclusions

162
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,430
and the other is regulation of cognition

163
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,830
so taking those things and then applying

164
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,599
them to specific scenarios and we know

165
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,878
that there are all kinds of benefits

166
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,500
that come along with that it makes you a

167
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,639
better learner of course it makes you a

168
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,930
better problem-solver

169
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,849
it helps you understand the relationship

170
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,620
between not just knowing something but

171
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,870
doing it and applying that knowledge and

172
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,479
this is the key one it gives you the

173
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,819
ability to consciously use specific

174
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:51,438
thought patterns at appropriate times

175
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,460
because we don't always think the same

176
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,319
way in every scenario different

177
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,520
scenarios call for different forms of

178
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,589
thinking's and if you can harness that

179
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,270
that makes you a better analyst and that

180
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:00,949
goes well beyond investigations but

181
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,560
particularly for our use case here that

182
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:05,779
certainly applies now a problem with

183
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,889
this however is that our field in

184
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:09,020
general and analysts in our field

185
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:11,210
generally lack this extreme or high

186
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,378
level of metacognitive awareness it's

187
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,378
something we really suffer with

188
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,549
they had a group of sociologists that

189
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,340
went into a sock and actually embedded

190
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,620
themselves in a sock for 15 months and

191
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,120
this is one of the big takeaways from

192
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,210
their study I'm gonna read this for

193
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,219
y'all the profession is so nascent that

194
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,590
the how-tos have not been fully realized

195
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:41,840
even by the people who have the

196
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:44,480
knowledge the process required to

197
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,790
connect the dots is unclear even to

198
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,120
analysts to read that second part again

199
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:53,990
the process required to connect the dots

200
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,820
is unclear even to analysts and we heard

201
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,920
this reflected in the interviews with

202
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,490
our analysts this summer here's one

203
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,790
example

204
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,160
I can't script what I do I can't just

205
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,709
give a run book to somebody to go this

206
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,380
is what I do because it's very much in

207
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,750
the moment here's another example and

208
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,910
this was what one of our analysts had to

209
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,850
say at the end of his interview process

210
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,469
it's interesting to think about usually

211
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,270
this is a process with a lot of

212
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,060
shortcuts where you don't necessarily

213
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,670
have to systematically think through it

214
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,829
I'm used to the pathways enough that I

215
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,219
don't question myself as much as I

216
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:34,400
should security analysts know how to do

217
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,750
their jobs they don't know how they know

218
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,970
they just do which works all right if

219
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,760
you have some experience this is a big

220
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,530
problem for new analysts who don't have

221
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,100
that foundation of knowledge to fall

222
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,949
back on

223
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,110
they don't just know yet and when

224
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,330
experienced analysts are trying to train

225
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,820
the new analysts if all they can say is

226
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,320
I just know how to do it that makes it

227
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,180
much more difficult to train new

228
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,740
analysts and bring them up to speed

229
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,449
quickly so they can do their jobs

230
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,350
effectively faster so with that in mind

231
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,730
in thinking about this notion of

232
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,760
metacognition and being able to apply

233
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,040
specific thinking strategies to specific

234
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,360
scenarios and my time in the salk I

235
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,560
spent a lot of time teaching and

236
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,580
consulting and security operation

237
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,849
centers and quite a few of them every

238
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,080
year throughout the year and one of the

239
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,360
things I've noticed is this use of

240
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,400
divergent and convergent thought that

241
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,510
occurs during the security analysis

242
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,730
process so this is something we really

243
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,130
sought out to study so I'll give you a

244
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,390
bit of a brief primer on what that means

245
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,860
when I say divergent and convergent

246
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,990
thought and we have some pretty

247
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,180
here but in general the Virgin thinking

248
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,560
is used to solve abstract problems with

249
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,329
many possible answers so you have an

250
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,719
initial input and you generate a list of

251
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:47,180
ideas from that to some degree some key

252
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,329
features of divergent thinking include

253
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,060
things like intuition reflecting and

254
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:57,410
gaining some insights generating lists

255
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:59,180
of ideas and Durga theme is also

256
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,310
generally correlated with creativity so

257
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,839
it's a creative form of thinking the

258
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,880
exercise we did just a moment ago where

259
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,440
I had to create the list of things that

260
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,600
was an exercise in divergent thinking

261
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,880
that required to use some creative type

262
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,110
thinking to come up with that list and

263
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,519
coming up with all those options from a

264
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,579
single input that was divergent thinking

265
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,410
that you did at that point now the other

266
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,449
side of this is convergent thing and

267
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,920
that's where you have all these lists of

268
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,750
options and then you narrow down and

269
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,130
pick the one you're going to go with

270
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,690
right because you can have all these

271
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,220
ideas but eventually you have to pursue

272
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,290
one of them and that is convergent

273
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,290
thinking converging on one thing from

274
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,880
lots of potential things as Chris just

275
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,399
mentioned conversion thinking some of

276
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,189
the key features are assessing idea

277
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:43,279
feasibility and judging ideas based on

278
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,540
logic and on fact so what we're going to

279
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,610
have you'll do now is we're gonna have

280
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,890
you use your convergent thinking skills

281
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,350
we want you to take a look at the list

282
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,779
that you created earlier using your

283
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,470
divergent thinking skills we want you to

284
00:11:53,779 --> 00:12:00,890
pick your one single best place to start

285
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:02,600
in this investigation just one that's

286
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,490
all you get you get one fresh move so

287
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,980
take a couple of moments look at your

288
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,920
list and pick your one best starting

289
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,970
point and once you have your best

290
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,519
starting point I'd love to see some

291
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,519
hands and somebody to share right here

292
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,130
okay what law says what process launched

293
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,689
it which is I believe what Danny said

294
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:31,720
earlier great yeah well what path did it

295
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:33,130
run from really good up in the back okay

296
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,000
what process wrote it like wrote it to

297
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,470
disk very good right here has it ever

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:46,240
happened before here really good right

299
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:47,620
back here you sir where did it come from

300
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,640
and what context comes of that very good

301
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,590
so we got a lot of good things here

302
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,170
really good now of course

303
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,230
notice here that everyone had a lot of

304
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,719
people had a different best first thing

305
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,810
so not everybody had the same thing

306
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,210
that's kind of interesting isn't it so

307
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,089
the version of convergent thought are to

308
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,560
some degree related as with the exercise

309
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,150
we just went through we went through a

310
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,619
divergent exercise where you created all

311
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,720
these potential choices from the single

312
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,190
input and then based upon that you then

313
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,840
can only pick one to move forward with

314
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,340
so you converge and that's the first

315
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,990
thing you're doing the highest value

316
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,630
thing that you think will get you your

317
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,570
best value there this process can also

318
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,420
be called creative problem-solving so as

319
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,640
we mentioned divergent thinking is more

320
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,319
closely related to creative thought that

321
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,240
convergent thinking is part of it and

322
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,640
during the creative problem-solving

323
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,890
process you cycle between these two

324
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,750
different styles of thinking so in a

325
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,180
security investigation this might look

326
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,610
like coming up with a list of potential

327
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,160
causes and then assessing how reasonable

328
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,130
those causes might be or coming up with

329
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,530
a list of problems potential or

330
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,810
potential solutions and then deciding

331
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:59,410
which solution is the best one for that

332
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,550
situation yes so divergent convergent

333
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,990
thinking are really the things that

334
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,550
we're focused on here and we wanted to

335
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,140
explore those and learn more about how

336
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,260
analysts use those how they arrived at

337
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,400
that thought what value exists there so

338
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,080
we could then figure out strategies

339
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,319
practical strategies for leveraging that

340
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,910
in the salk environment so Steph has a

341
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,550
science background she has a master's in

342
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,410
psychology if you know me I do a lot of

343
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,300
psychology based investigation work as

344
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,880
well so we set out and let said let's

345
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,770
science the crap out of this thing in

346
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,150
science the crap out of it we did so we

347
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,689
did a somewhat formal research study

348
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,340
mixed-methods study

349
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,680
where we started with primarily

350
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,460
qualitative grounded theory research and

351
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,620
we're not there with qualitative

352
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,140
research it's really focused on human

353
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,700
experience and so what we did here you

354
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,080
see a screenshot there at the right we

355
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,490
actually went out and interviewed a lot

356
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,170
of analysts they had to meet specific

357
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,970
criteria we interviewed them we

358
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,530
converted that to text and then we

359
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,810
started looking for evidence of themes

360
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,699
that are occurring within that text we

361
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,079
analyzed all of these you see the the

362
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,220
little bubbles there on the right are

363
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,020
different themes those are kind of hard

364
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,700
to read one says low ambiguity tolerance

365
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,439
and other one says add activity and the

366
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,640
other one says intuition those are some

367
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,370
of the themes that we were looking at

368
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,810
and then once we coded all these we

369
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,280
started looking for patterns that emerge

370
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,290
so the prevalence of certain themes

371
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,449
certain things current in certain orders

372
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,180
the lack of certain themes in particular

373
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,830
cases to try to build theory of how

374
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,319
divergent and convergent thought are

375
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,150
used in the investigative process and

376
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,060
that could be alert analysis malware

377
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,470
reverse engineering Intel based analysis

378
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,199
it's somewhat Universal we believe in

379
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,330
that regard but we explore it across

380
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,860
those different dynamics to build this

381
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,740
theory that we're gonna talk about here

382
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,660
in a moment we're gonna tell you a

383
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,610
little bit more about the structure of

384
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,520
our research study before we get into

385
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,860
the results we had 16 participants this

386
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,500
summer four were women and twelve were

387
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,350
men we wanted to get the most complete

388
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,950
picture that we could of what different

389
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,990
kinds of investigators might do during

390
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,360
their investigations so we tried to get

391
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,790
a range of different investigative job

392
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:05,860
roles we also tried to get a very wide

393
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:08,319
range of experience in the field we had

394
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,030
two different kinds of measures to help

395
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,000
us take a look at the data that we

396
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,980
gathered we had both quantitative and we

397
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,060
had qualitative measures I'm going to

398
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,510
talk about the quantitative measures

399
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,819
first we gave three assessments to our

400
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,430
analysts the first was very simple we

401
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,340
asked them to rate their skill level on

402
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,900
a one to three point scale whether they

403
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,350
felt themselves to be beginners

404
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,990
intermediate analysts or experts Chris

405
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,570
also ranked our analysts on a numeric

406
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,600
scale we combined those two numbers

407
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,150
together and that gave us our first

408
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,700
quantitative measure

409
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:47,390
which was the primary skill score we

410
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,510
used that score to organize our analysts

411
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:52,750
into three different skill groups

412
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:55,700
beginner intermediate and expert our

413
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,710
second quantitative measure was one that

414
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,590
we read ourselves and called the analyst

415
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:03,470
skill inventory the analyst skill

416
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:06,800
inventory was a series of questions and

417
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,540
self-report where analysts could tell us

418
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,300
their level of comfort with different

419
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:14,450
tools with different kinds of evidence

420
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,970
and also kind of report their own

421
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,680
investigative behavior our last

422
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,720
quantitative measure was the

423
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,880
metacognitive awareness inventory which

424
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,100
is previously existing and just gave us

425
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,150
a way to score analysts metacognitive

426
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:30,800
awareness on the qualitative side Chris

427
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,940
already mentioned this a little bit I'm

428
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,700
just going to kind of give you the brief

429
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,300
overview we went into the literature and

430
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,770
found as many different traits and

431
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,990
behaviors as we could that were

432
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:45,500
correlated with divergent and convergent

433
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:48,650
thinking we group those traits together

434
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,590
into groups that we very cleverly called

435
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,840
group traits categories and that gave us

436
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,240
something that we could observe and

437
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,679
score analysts behaviors during the

438
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,750
interview and analysts wouldn't

439
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,840
necessarily need to be aware of the

440
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,060
kinds of thinking they were engaging in

441
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,129
without we can still have an a window

442
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,320
into analyst thinking and whether they

443
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:14,060
were using a divergent or a convergent

444
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:16,639
thinking process are y'all excited yeah

445
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:19,850
y'all should get excited because we're

446
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,640
gonna start talking about results we had

447
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,810
one major quantitative finding which is

448
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,420
what I'm going to share with you first

449
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,909
so here we have the metacognitive

450
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,130
awareness inventories for the three

451
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,900
separate skill groups the numbers that

452
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,780
you see there are averages for the

453
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,300
group's overall and larger numbers are

454
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,920
better larger numbers mean that the

455
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,870
analysts believe themselves to have

456
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,050
higher levels of metacognitive awareness

457
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,850
as you can see the beginner group

458
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,340
believed themselves to have a higher

459
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,129
level of metacognitive awareness than

460
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,689
the expert analysts this is an example

461
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,480
of something called the dunning-kruger

462
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,669
if

463
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,610
it's the dunning-kruger effect is not

464
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:01,740
exclusive to cybersecurity it's across

465
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,649
disciplines the hallmark of the

466
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,130
dunning-kruger effect is overconfidence

467
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,080
in one skills particularly for beginners

468
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:12,809
those with lower skill levels tend to

469
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,960
overestimate their own level of skill

470
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:18,178
and experts tend to more accurately

471
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,850
evaluate where they're at

472
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:22,559
as far as skill levels go and this is

473
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,899
interesting to us because it's one

474
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,530
example of how analysts might not

475
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,059
necessarily be metacognitively aware and

476
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,590
it's super cool because we talk about

477
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,389
dunning-kruger a lot and a lot of people

478
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,580
blog about it and things like that but

479
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,960
actual data to show it is pretty cool

480
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,299
and it can be cited and all that good

481
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,320
stuff now I'm gonna talk a little bit

482
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,150
more about the qualitative findings

483
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,620
which is really our main goal again we

484
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,590
were trying to build theory build a

485
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,909
model of how analysts use divergent and

486
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,889
convergent thought and where that

487
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,179
emerged and this is the model that

488
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,140
resulted it's it's a little bit of a

489
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,610
mouthful it's called the ambiguity

490
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,950
driven convergence model or ATC model

491
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,879
for short I'm gonna go into each one of

492
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,200
these things a little bit more

493
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,179
individually but the general idea is

494
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,190
that most analysts do not start at

495
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,480
divergent and convergent thought now say

496
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,250
that it doesn't happen but generally it

497
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,559
doesn't most analysts start by relying

498
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,000
on their intuition and most of us have a

499
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,110
sense of what intuition is we're gonna

500
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,940
talk about it a little more in a moment

501
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,520
but they rely on their intuition and

502
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,860
they are driven away from that intuition

503
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,629
when a couple things happen one is when

504
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,280
a high-stakes scenario occurs we'll talk

505
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,559
about what those are and the other is in

506
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,200
the presence of analyst who has a trait

507
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,460
which is low ambiguity tolerance when

508
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,720
those two things happen that's when

509
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,400
people start doing the things like we

510
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,840
did in our exercise creating lists

511
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,270
thinking lots of different options and

512
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,409
then picking one to go pro so people

513
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,000
don't generally start with the Virgen

514
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,470
convergent thought but they get there

515
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,010
and they get there usually from

516
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,780
intuition so I'm going to talk a little

517
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,120
bit more about intuition and exactly

518
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,668
what that means again intuition is a

519
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,989
divergent thought process and one of the

520
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:51,480
definitions I found that I liked the

521
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,090
best was that intuition is a vague

522
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,850
perception that points work in a

523
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:59,760
promising direction intuition is not

524
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:02,699
based on logic or deliberate thinking

525
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,530
it's based on prior knowledge and on

526
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,809
feelings

527
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,190
we saw analysts use their intuition at

528
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,750
the

529
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,940
beginning of scenarios and at the

530
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,640
beginning of their investigations when

531
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,500
we asked them how they decided to

532
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,240
proceed how they decided to start their

533
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,030
investigations these are some of the

534
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,560
responses that we got so I would say I

535
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,450
usually start with the first thing that

536
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,270
comes to mind and then table all the

537
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,760
others another response I just kind of

538
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,889
go with my gut and you know based on

539
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,080
experience start looking at things and

540
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:37,430
this was a very common sentiment across

541
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,169
our participants so we there was a lot

542
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,340
of going with my gut which i think is a

543
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,590
lot of us how it would describe how we

544
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,120
do what we do and there's some problems

545
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,679
of that intuition isn't a wholly bad

546
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,719
thing intuition allows us to make

547
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,730
judgements again based like Steph said

548
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,380
based upon our experience but the

549
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,270
quality of those judgments we found is

550
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,610
not always as great as we would hope it

551
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,560
would be so one of the things we did

552
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,969
with our the folks we were interviewing

553
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,040
is we went through a series of scenarios

554
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,360
actually the scenario we had y'all do at

555
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,530
the beginning of this talk was one of

556
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,750
them we did that one in another one

557
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,220
where we had the folks create a list of

558
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,140
the things that they would use to

559
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,750
investigate investigated paths questions

560
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,520
or data sources and then we asked them

561
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,450
to converge and pick one the only

562
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,639
difference with them is we actually

563
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,280
evaluated not live with them but later

564
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,290
on we evaluated the quality of their

565
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,360
responses so we could separate out high

566
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,800
quality responses from low quality

567
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,320
responses who is picking the right

568
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,230
things to investigate first based upon

569
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,740
our collective experience and we found

570
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:35,390
some pretty interesting things now

571
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,100
intuition has a role in divergence in

572
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,930
divergent thinking if you think that

573
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,820
when you created your list a moment ago

574
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,500
I'm betting for most of you especially

575
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,970
if you have investigative experience the

576
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,260
first few things on your list you didn't

577
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,390
even have to think about you probably

578
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,500
just put them down there immediately but

579
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,390
as time went on and you kind of

580
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,100
exhausted that initial pull of intuition

581
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,810
then you probably started thinking a

582
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,250
little bit more deliberately what else

583
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,980
can I add what else have I not thought

584
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,210
of and that's when you kind of left

585
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,440
intuition a little bit so the first two

586
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,240
things on the list are usually intuitive

587
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,700
the rest of things are not and that was

588
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,990
interesting relevant to our data because

589
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,150
one of the things we found was that of

590
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,330
the high quality responses the good

591
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:14,330
responses that we had only 10% of them

592
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,919
were the first item and folks lists so

593
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,290
for almost everyone the first thing they

594
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,430
came up with was not the thing that they

595
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,600
would end up choosing that is the best

596
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,320
way to go

597
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,639
about it which is kind of

598
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,960
counterintuitive to what of a lot of us

599
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,370
think right a lot of us think that our

600
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,440
first thought would be the best thing

601
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,989
and that in our experience and this data

602
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,850
did not prove to be the case now if that

603
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,130
said the things that people did pick

604
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,719
were of course on their lists that were

605
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,890
high quality responses ninety-five

606
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,330
percent of them were actually on the

607
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,880
list it just so happened most of them

608
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,370
were actually in the last half of the

609
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,590
list so it was when folks were moving

610
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:49,580
away from intuitive thought towards more

611
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:51,439
deliberate thinking that they were

612
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,850
picking better quality responses they

613
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,130
were picking the better choices of how

614
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,860
to investigate things again intuition

615
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,270
isn't bad but it can be dangerous and we

616
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,479
have to think about that and the things

617
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,530
that we're doing so again the model we

618
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,820
found that folks generally start with

619
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,410
intuition and then they are pushed away

620
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,760
from it so how are they pushed away from

621
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,770
it and more towards divergent and

622
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,870
convergent thinking well there's two

623
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,660
factors here one of them is a trait and

624
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,790
one of them is a situation the trait is

625
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,960
called low ambiguity tolerance and you

626
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,700
heard me mention that earlier

627
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,380
of all the traits that we measured in

628
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,840
our qualitative research this is the one

629
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,780
we measured the most in analyst and the

630
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,949
general idea here we're defining this as

631
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,530
discomfort with unclear meanings and the

632
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,030
unknown and you might think in some ways

633
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,649
we're actually comfortable ambiguity

634
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,389
because we deal with it a lot but the

635
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,730
truth is the thing that motivates most

636
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,380
analysts that we see is

637
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,820
uncomfortableness with ambiguity because

638
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,050
we have this timeline of events and we

639
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,330
have to make this determination did

640
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,810
something bad happen yes or no how bad

641
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,760
was it

642
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,350
we're only figuring that out if we build

643
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,060
out a thorough timeline that we're happy

644
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,800
with if there are big gaps in it we are

645
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,210
very uncomfortable with that so when we

646
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,770
say low ambiguity tolerance that's what

647
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,050
we're talking about uncomfortableness

648
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,610
with the unknown and not knowing being

649
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,750
afraid to miss things in our

650
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,580
investigation which i think is something

651
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,950
most of us can relate to so that's a

652
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,540
trait that we find generally and most of

653
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,040
the analysts that we deal with this

654
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,780
wasn't half of research where we can say

655
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,250
you know does the annals profession

656
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,600
drawing people who naturally have this

657
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,460
or is it something that's developed when

658
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,169
you while you're in practice of being an

659
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,730
analyst I would guess probably a little

660
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,680
bit of both but that's not what we study

661
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,060
here we just found evidence of it

662
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,910
amongst all the animals we are deal

663
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,159
dealing with - quite a quite an extreme

664
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,960
level so that's a trait that's present

665
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,810
in analysts it exists in most of us to

666
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,040
some degree and then there are

667
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,870
situations that pull us away from

668
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,770
intuition and these situations are

669
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,000
actually a category

670
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,879
situations which we define as

671
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,920
high-stakes situations a hostage

672
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,350
situation is any situation which has the

673
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,810
potential to increase your anxiety based

674
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,459
upon the potential outcome and our data

675
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:49,429
set we found three categories of this

676
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,480
one are unfamiliar in vague scenarios so

677
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,670
dealing with things that you haven't

678
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,590
dealt with there seen before maybe the

679
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,450
new alert that you've never seen a new

680
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,800
detection tool maybe a data type or a

681
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,180
system type that you've not dealt with

682
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,500
before that would certainly increase a

683
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,270
little bit of anxiety and be a bit more

684
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,340
high-stakes make you doubt yourself a

685
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,840
little bit more another investigative

686
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,699
roadblocks so when maybe you've

687
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,350
exhausted all the questions you know to

688
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,240
ask or all the places you know to look

689
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,770
maybe you suspect there's certainly

690
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,120
something malicious going on you can't

691
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,520
quite figure out how to prove or

692
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,320
disprove that that's the case that would

693
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,420
be an investigative roadblock in the

694
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,970
final high-stakes scenario or any really

695
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,230
social scenarios that is often when

696
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,790
you're having to take your own results

697
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,830
and findings and share them with your

698
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,600
peers maybe teammates who are doing

699
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,730
working on the same investigation or

700
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,230
maybe your boss or maybe putting things

701
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,790
into a ticketing system something like

702
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,840
that but anything social where you

703
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,820
haven't share that information and can

704
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,620
raise anxiety and can essentially become

705
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,210
a high stakes area so these are all

706
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,800
things where they kind of force you to

707
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,900
be a little bit more thoughtful about

708
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,639
your findings and and really want to try

709
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,310
to prove those out to yourself and

710
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,450
others a little bit more so when these

711
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,280
two things happen

712
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,470
that's what generally pulls you away

713
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,050
from intuition and pushes you towards

714
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,520
divergent and convergent thought so we

715
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,710
had some quotes from the folks we

716
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,000
interviewed related to that one analyst

717
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,650
said that it's easy to get focused on

718
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,150
one thing and get hung up on that and

719
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,730
then I'm always like well let's take a

720
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,080
step back or go for a walk and take your

721
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,850
mind off of it for a little bit for me

722
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,129
that works where I'll just go for a walk

723
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,290
and think about other things another

724
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,880
analyst said later on I may reflect on

725
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,350
it and be like you know what if you just

726
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,670
have walked away gone down stairs and

727
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,110
had a coffee and come back you may have

728
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:23,150
thought of a completely different way to

729
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,340
handle this a lot of the analysts we

730
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,590
talked to spoke of physical separation

731
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,600
if not just mental separation but actual

732
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,699
physical separation from the issue

733
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,139
because it allowed them to stop clicking

734
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,760
on things stop typing on those things

735
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,560
think things through move away from

736
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,180
intuition apply more deliberate thought

737
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,350
come up with all these lists of options

738
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,520
so that when they sit back down at the

739
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,439
keyboard they pick the one they want to

740
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,940
go with the vergence to convergence

741
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,040
that's what we're seeing with the model

742
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,630
so the model again basically describes

743
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,610
that process where you start

744
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,080
intuition and the combined trait of low

745
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,780
immunity tolerance with the situation

746
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,790
that is high-stakes leads folks to this

747
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,680
notion of divergent and convergent

748
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:02,570
thought and that was one of our primary

749
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,650
findings from the research alright let's

750
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,350
get excited again because we're going to

751
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:08,750
talk about how to apply some of this and

752
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,730
deliberately leverage divergent and

753
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:14,600
convergent thinking to improve your

754
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:17,180
investigative process so step one start

755
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,969
with an investigation input this could

756
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,980
be an input from a current investigation

757
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,560
something like a piece of malware or an

758
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,750
alert it can also be something from a

759
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,700
previous investigation you can do this

760
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,510
for practice it doesn't have to be as

761
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,820
part of a current ongoing investigation

762
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:36,800
step two make a list of investigative

763
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,810
pads but this is starting to sound a

764
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,300
little bit familiar for y'all who are

765
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:44,480
here with us today so sit down and

766
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:46,940
actually write down a list of different

767
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,220
ideas write down all the questions you

768
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,680
can think of to ask write down different

769
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,110
evidence to look into write down

770
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,350
different timeline scenarios to prove

771
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,149
out but sit down and actually write this

772
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,980
out this is an important part of

773
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:03,610
engaging your different kinds of

774
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,290
thinking so type it up write it out and

775
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:08,990
then the last step after you've done

776
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:12,050
that take a few moments and pick your

777
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:13,550
best path pick the option that you think

778
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:16,879
will give you the most bang for your

779
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:19,940
buck in the investigation this is not

780
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,590
only a great way to help your current

781
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,380
investigations but if you do this as

782
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,870
practice over time your own intuition

783
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,330
will get better it will get stronger and

784
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,310
those items those high-quality items

785
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:34,220
will move farther and farther up your

786
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,950
list this is also a wonderful thing to

787
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,470
do with your team so maybe once a week

788
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,900
or once a month get everybody together

789
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,820
sit down at a table go through this

790
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,890
process together come up with a list

791
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,260
come up with your best investigative

792
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,750
options this is great for your

793
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,879
experienced analysts it's also wonderful

794
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,520
for the new analysts because they get to

795
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,049
hear how some of these thought processes

796
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,679
work they get to learn some new

797
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:02,450
ideas the crazy thing about this is

798
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:03,649
we're asking you to do this deliberate

799
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,759
deliberately because we think it would

800
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:06,018
improve the quality of your analysis

801
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,429
you're already doing it subconsciously

802
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:09,350
that's kind of what we found you're

803
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:10,700
already doing this so by asking you to

804
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,629
take this and bring it kind of into

805
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,309
conscious thought

806
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:15,168
that's that metacognitive awareness it's

807
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:17,299
not just knowing how you think it's

808
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,460
regulating it applying these specific

809
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:21,408
thought Styles deliberately practicing

810
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,570
the craft to get better at it intuitions

811
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:25,070
sometimes a good thing but we also want

812
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:27,320
to strengthen it while decreasing our

813
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,820
reliance on it and this type of activity

814
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,230
works really well it's not super time

815
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,850
consuming we did a small version of it

816
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,190
within the bounds of this talk

817
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:36,139
you can spend 15 20 maybe 30 minutes max

818
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,159
on it in a group setting I recommend

819
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:39,019
once a week I've worked in the number of

820
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,960
socks who are now doing some version of

821
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:43,489
this and it's dramatically increasing

822
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,200
how they rate at which new analysts are

823
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:48,230
accumulating experience and dramatically

824
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,190
affecting the accuracy of the expert

825
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,080
analysts and how they're approaching

826
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,529
things in a consistent basis it's pretty

827
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,629
cool

828
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:55,549
now the other part of this kind of a

829
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:56,809
practical takeaway is that if you do

830
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:58,850
this and if you do this over and over

831
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:00,350
and over again and over and over and

832
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:03,019
over again with all these different

833
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,609
sorts of alerts you'll start to notice

834
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:06,440
trends emerge right you'll notice you're

835
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:08,119
asking the same questions relate it to

836
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,470
some alerts versus some others and there

837
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:11,359
are different categories of alerts that

838
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,679
you may have and if you do this over and

839
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,449
over and over again and you write all

840
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:18,679
this down and then you rank of those

841
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:21,080
things what have you developed it's a

842
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,440
playbook right that's a super useful

843
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:27,439
thing again it helps teach the new

844
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,460
analysts how to do how to do the job now

845
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,200
you don't just hand them the playbook

846
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,460
and say do this you hand it to them let

847
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,169
them start picking the way they want to

848
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,580
approach it make sure they're asking why

849
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:36,169
they're doing the things they do and

850
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,340
have folks who can tell them why or

851
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:39,559
point them in for that direction where

852
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,699
they can learn why and then you're

853
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:42,529
developing new analysts that at a

854
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,759
particularly useful rate and again

855
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:45,590
you're more experienced analysts this

856
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,669
brings some consistency to them it makes

857
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,779
it to where they're not forgetting

858
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:48,830
things that you might otherwise forget

859
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:51,470
because some of these playbooks can be

860
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,820
quite long 20 30 40 items in some cases

861
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,869
I know many of you may have develop

862
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,830
ritty long list than just the two

863
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:56,658
minutes I gave you for that one

864
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,639
individual scenario so the idea is you

865
00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:00,320
keep doing this over and over and you

866
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:02,840
spot these trends you may find you have

867
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,999
a playbook for dns-based alerts or

868
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,980
phishing based alerts exploit kits you

869
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:08,330
categorize these things and focus on

870
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,470
your most common alerts are the most

871
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,210
common scenarios that you're in

872
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,320
skating in the sock and by doing the

873
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,299
thing that Steph talked about you're

874
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,789
inherently already doing most of the

875
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,860
work for your PlayBook development the

876
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:20,840
trick is just writing it down and

877
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,500
putting it in a shared accessible place

878
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,510
which can be pretty darn useful

879
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,220
we'd like to note that just like all of

880
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,059
the research our study does have some

881
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,970
limitations

882
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:35,450
first of all qualitative research is not

883
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:38,090
meant to prove things it's exploratory

884
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:40,520
it's meant to find new ideas and new

885
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,139
themes that can be researched in more

886
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,940
detail later and that's what some of

887
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,490
these concepts need they need more

888
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:50,179
in-depth research specifically on these

889
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:52,280
different ideas our sample was limited

890
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:55,610
our sample was based on english-speaking

891
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,590
us-based analysts and the metacognitive

892
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,209
awareness piece and specifically the

893
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,158
lack of metacognitive awareness piece

894
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,679
could have affected the validity of our

895
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:04,760
results Steph talked a little bit

896
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,890
earlier about the quantitative measures

897
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,000
we use we had to develop some of our own

898
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,770
one of those was the analyst skill

899
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,320
inventory this is probably because there

900
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:16,030
are not any psychometrically validated

901
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,289
proven ways to evaluate analyst skill

902
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,480
that's something we like to hope to move

903
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:21,860
towards eventually ours is flawed it's

904
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,299
far from perfect that would be its own

905
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,408
study in itself to continue to work on

906
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:26,510
that which is something we hope to do

907
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:28,309
you see those are the five factors we

908
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,570
basically analyst skill inventory on we

909
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:30,799
hope to improve that over time so it a

910
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,939
little is a little bit more valid but

911
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,770
it's a little bit limited in our case

912
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,720
because again there isn't one that

913
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:38,150
exists out there we really struggled

914
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,100
with particularly how to weight the

915
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:43,730
different factors and figure out how

916
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,709
they would impact her into different

917
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,390
analyst investigations that that

918
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,049
weighting portion was extremely

919
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,520
difficult

920
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:52,870
and in the immortal words of Tom Petty

921
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:57,080
sometimes waiting is the hardest part

922
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:59,389
now so that that's actually it that's

923
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,039
that's the short version of our findings

924
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,450
normally we'd stop and take questions

925
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,280
but I'm actually not gonna take any

926
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,100
questions today but I have a really good

927
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,119
reason we actually wrote all this up I

928
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,290
know this is a little bit of a novel

929
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,760
concept sometimes at security

930
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,589
conferences we actually wrote a paper on

931
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,990
this and the paper is being released

932
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:16,668
today actually right now there's the

933
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,080
link right there it's free to download

934
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:21,529
you don't even have to put in your email

935
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,418
address it's it's free to all there's

936
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,659
this whole notion in our field

937
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:29,690
a lot of folks are afraid of academic

938
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:30,890
research they they open up the document

939
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,179
and I see that it's formatted in two

940
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:33,469
columns immediately recognized it's

941
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,900
academic and they turn it off and go

942
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:37,189
away I understand we didn't put it in

943
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,409
two column format for that specific

944
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:42,139
reason but there's value to academic

945
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:44,090
like research our research isn't 100%

946
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,830
perfectly academic but it's academic

947
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,750
liking and that style and in that vein

948
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,520
and there's certain there's value I

949
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,650
found in again becoming more

950
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,159
metacognitive Leah we're learning how to

951
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,900
do the job better because ultimately

952
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,430
investigative work is learning it is the

953
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,750
same thing so if we understand how we

954
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,040
learn we increase that metacognitive

955
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,900
awareness we all become better at our

956
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,380
jobs it helps new folks become better at

957
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,750
their jobs

958
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,820
it makes entryway into the profession a

959
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,110
lot easier and that's something that I

960
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,110
think is on all of us to do to continue

961
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:13,820
to develop and hone the craft so with

962
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,750
that said thank you all for coming out

963
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:27,170
we appreciate the time

964
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:28,550
thank you so much so this is unrelated

965
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,790
to the talk this is kind of something

966
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,790
different

967
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:39,860
perfect so how many of you were at

968
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:41,660
security in Econ last year so quite a

969
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,740
few you had a good time yeah yeah so the

970
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,020
folks of security in can't do a

971
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,069
fantastic job of this conference and one

972
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,290
of the reasons I think they do that is

973
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,150
because they care so much about it I was

974
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:53,210
actually with with my good friend Phil

975
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,710
here a couple months ago we were

976
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,880
teaching a class up in Detroit and he

977
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,020
was asking me was like well Chris you

978
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,070
know you know what do you think is scary

979
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,820
and what can we do to make it better and

980
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,250
one of the things that I was thinking

981
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,260
about was you know if you remember at

982
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,000
this time last year right before the

983
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,230
morning break Phil got up and was

984
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,030
talking it was like okay if you want to

985
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,940
go upstairs where there's a nice area to

986
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,710
talk and mingle and there's some

987
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,990
security onion banners up there and you

988
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,420
could take your picture at the security

989
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,589
onion banner and what we found was

990
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,670
everybody kind of rushed up there to do

991
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,110
it and particularly everyone wanted to

992
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,410
take their picture with none other than

993
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:26,600
head onion Doug Burt's over here what we

994
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:28,160
found however was that there's only so

995
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,230
much a Doug to go around and there was

996
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,450
basically almost a riot to get your

997
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,920
picture made with Doug so we wanted to

998
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,919
do something about this

999
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,590
so so fortunately about I know two or

1000
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,820
three years ago Doug had a faint media

1001
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,590
thing he was doing where he had to have

1002
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,000
this picture made and I think I actually

1003
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:01,900
told him at the time this picture will

1004
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,080
come back to haunt you and it officially

1005
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,080
has

1006
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,430
so we will be carrying this up to the

1007
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,480
top for the break which is going to talk

1008
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,399
about here in a moment and you all be

1009
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,140

1010
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,190

1011
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,420

1012
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:31,130

1013
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:33,090
