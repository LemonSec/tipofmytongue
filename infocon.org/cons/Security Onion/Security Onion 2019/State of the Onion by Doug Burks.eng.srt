48
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:28,700
so speaking of Chris Sanders so we

49
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,290
earlier in the year we published this

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,489
security onion book folks have been

51
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,230
asking for a long long time hey your

52
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,620
documentation is great but I'd really

53
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,480
like it in a printed book format and so

54
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,550
we did that we took our documentation we

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,310
made it available on Amazon you can

56
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:50,690
purchase that and we made the decision

57
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:53,600
to donate all the proceeds of those

58
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,480
sales to the rural technology fund so

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:03,930

77
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,590
rural Technology Fund it's a really

78
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,390
great effort run by some really great

79
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,780
folks doing some really great work so

80
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,548
thank you for that next up I want to say

81
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,530
thank you to everybody who has

82
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:09,010
downloaded a copy of security onion we

83
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,049
are now over 800,000 downloads of our

84
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,700
ISO image that's not the only way that

85
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,590
you can download our software but that's

86
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,048
the primary way that most folks get it

87
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,358
so it would have never occurred to me

88
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,978
way back in 2008 that I started this

89
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,760
little hobby project that we would now

90
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:26,979
be over 800,000 downloads it blows my

91
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,669
mind so thank you all very much for your

92
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:35,700
active participation in our community so

93
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:39,340
what I'd like to talk about today is

94
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:41,560
supercharging your stock how do you

95
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:47,159
supercharge your security operation

96
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:51,130
center the subtitle of this talk is

97
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:54,150
building a better Berthe now some of you

98
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:59,190
asking the question who is Bertha a

99
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:01,900
better question might be what is Bertha

100
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,820
so big dog out there that was an

101
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,380
embarrassing picture that was kind of an

102
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,270
embarrassing thing that happened but

103
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,830
we're going to talk about some other

104
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,270
embarrassing pictures if you remember a

105
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,070
couple years ago at security on you

106
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,830
conference I showed this embarrassing

107
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,250
picture of me

108
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,229
as a kid with my homemade Nintendo

109
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,180
arcade alright that was kind of

110
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,890
embarrassing I'm gonna share some more

111
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,680
embarrassing pictures from my childhood

112
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,830
just a lot of fun so what is Bertha

113
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,450
think back to your first vehicle you

114
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,609
know for some of you it was that sweet

115
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,909
16 your parents bought you a brand-new

116
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,680
Ford Mustang for others maybe not so

117
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,320
much

118
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,890
maybe there's something like this Bertha

119
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:46,670
the wonder truck as in it's a wonder I'm

120
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:48,650
still alive okay so do we have any

121
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,720
classic truck fans in the audience you

122
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:57,440
might wager a guess as to the year of

123
00:05:50,720 --> 00:06:02,930
this classic antique so we're getting

124
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:05,210
close it's a 1967 Ford f100 wudu you

125
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:10,340
might like to wager a guess as to how

126
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:11,570
much we paid for this fine vehicle y'all

127
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,849
are really close three hundred and

128
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:17,000
seventy-five dollars and it was ours out

129
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,560
the door right and oh by the way when we

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,250
bought it it didn't look nearly this

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,040
good this actually looks better right so

132
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,590
this was my first vehicle okay

133
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:33,530
Bertha the Wonder truck and let me tell

134
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:36,619
you this thing has everything okay under

135
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:40,219
the hood was a 240 cubic inch inline

136
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:45,920
six-cylinder so we could do 0 to 60 in 5

137
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:49,430
point 3 minutes the brakes didn't work

138
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:55,840
too well but hey real men use engine

139
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,840
braking anyway right hi Chris

140
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,659
now it's kind of hard to see because

141
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,629
there's kind of a sign draped on the

142
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:07,449
side but the original bed was totally

143
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:09,909
destroyed it was a wooden bed the wood

144
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,829
had rotted the crossmembers were rusted

145
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:14,319
through so we tore off the original bed

146
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:17,559
altogether we built a brand-new stepside

147
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,239
bed cuz we're hardcore like that and you

148
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:21,939
know the wooden steps I admit it only

149
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:26,828
rubbed the tires a little bit just a

150
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:29,319
little bit okay now on that wooden step

151
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:31,779
side bed was a tool box to carry jumper

152
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,709
cables because I needed them all the

153
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:36,610
time

154
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:40,629
okay now would you just look at this

155
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:44,019
under the toolbox that was for us is a

156
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:47,110
bonus PA speaker that was wired up to my

157
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:48,369
CB radio microphone so I could key up

158
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:55,179
the mic and say hey get out of the way

159
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:59,049
my brakes don't work right now we did

160
00:07:55,179 --> 00:08:01,448
have one oddball tire because conformity

161
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:02,318
is boring nobody wants to be a

162
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,629
conformist you want to be a

163
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,439
nonconformist right so we had three

164
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:10,089
matching tires but zero matching mirrors

165
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,939
so that was kind of unique but you know

166
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,189
I focus on less on what's behind us and

167
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:20,709
more in front because I'm a forward

168
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:25,050
thinker right now I do want you to

169
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:28,409
notice the artisanal spray paint job

170
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,909
with a racing stripe down the middle

171
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:35,169
because that's good for another five

172
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:37,360
mile-per-hour right there right all this

173
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,299
thing really needs just some fancy RGB

174
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,389
lights it's good to go right truck of

175
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:49,050
your dreams all right so that was my

176
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:52,360
first vehicle and as as unique as it was

177
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:56,889
as with as many problems as I had with

178
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,319
it it did have at least some utility it

179
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:01,209
was a workhorse right I could jump in

180
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,430
the thing and I could go pull some stuff

181
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:05,739
I could haul some stuff I could move

182
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,839
some stuff around and you know I learned

183
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,880
a lot by working on this truck so it

184
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,220
certainly had some

185
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,820
value so it was really a work hell

186
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,050
workhorse for me now today I don't drive

187
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,730
Bertha anymore

188
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,900
alright that thing sitting in the woods

189
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:24,780
somewhere and so today I Drive a 2018

190
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,180
GMC Sierra this is a nice truck right

191
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:30,750
it's a workhorse too but it's faster

192
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:34,319
it's got a 6.2 liter v8 it goes zero to

193
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,630
60 in seconds rather than minutes it's

194
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,080
more powerful it's got a 6.2 liter v8

195
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:43,710
420 horsepower it's smoother it rides

196
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,100
nice right he just kind of floats down

197
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:50,310
the road so my new truck it has a lot of

198
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,160
advantages but it does had at least one

199
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,109
disadvantage compared to good old Bertha

200
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,410
and that's that when you pop the hood

201
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,600
that engine compartment it's so tightly

202
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,469
packed right it's so hard to work on

203
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,360
that thing and you've got to have

204
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,100
special tools and you gonna have special

205
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,140
training I see some nodding over there

206
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,060
you feel my pain right they don't make

207
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,620
them like they used to a good old Bertha

208
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,540
I could crawl inside the engine

209
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,690
compartment that changed spark plugs you

210
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:19,550
can't do that in modern vehicles right

211
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:22,200
so what does all this have to do with

212
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,579
security operation centers anyway what

213
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,120
does all this have to do with security

214
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,390
onion anyway when I first started in

215
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,150
security the tools kind of felt like

216
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:36,630
good old Bertha right I worked in a lot

217
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,939
of small shops with small budgets so we

218
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,770
may only have had one or two commercial

219
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,200
tools if we could have afforded that and

220
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,810
then maybe we tried to kind of fill some

221
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,190
gaps with some open source tools here

222
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,900
and there but there really was no

223
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:55,410
continuity it wasn't a smooth experience

224
00:10:50,900 --> 00:11:00,270
and so you know many commercial vendors

225
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:02,100
will sell you on a smoother ride but the

226
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,230
problem is they may have the hood welded

227
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,090
shut right where you can't get in there

228
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,560
and work on the product you can't get in

229
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:12,300
there and change your own spark plugs do

230
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:16,469
what you need to do ultimately defense

231
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:19,229
is hard but it's important and so it's

232
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,800
important for us to make defense easy

233
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,300
for others

234
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,189
so that's really where we're coming from

235
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,559
we want to take security on you we want

236
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:30,439
it to continue to be the workhorse that

237
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:32,540
it has been in your environments but we

238
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,509
want to make it faster we want to make

239
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:39,349
it more powerful we want to make it

240
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:42,019
smoother but at the same time keep it

241
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,040
easy to work on we want you to be able

242
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,929
to pop the hood

243
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,679
change your spark plugs change your oil

244
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:50,660
do what you need to do so that's kind of

245
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:55,819
setting the stage for what we want to

246
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:57,860
talk about today so let's talk a little

247
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:59,719
bit about the past year since the last

248
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,790
secure done.you conference I know a lot

249
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,529
of folks were here last year a lot of

250
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,029
new folks a lot of new faces so

251
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:07,339
appreciate you being here but I'll kind

252
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:10,189
of recap some of the things that we've

253
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,019
done over the past year to try to

254
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:14,170
further this goal of building a better

255
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:19,819
Berthe making it faster more powerful

256
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:22,009
smoother so starting off with a utility

257
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:24,290
called som port pcap so if you're new to

258
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,389
security onion this is the absolute

259
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,459
easiest way to get started with security

260
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:31,339
on you you download our ISO image you

261
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:34,248
simply run som port P cap and you give

262
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:36,259
it the path to a pcap file and that's

263
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:39,920
all you have to do it sets up the entire

264
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:42,949
system for you and it goes an aunt that

265
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,689
pcap through snorter sericata runs it

266
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:47,839
through bro generates all the nice

267
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:51,049
protocol logs and you're good to go it's

268
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,089
super fast it's super easy we made a lot

269
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:55,579
of changes to it to make it even faster

270
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:58,279
and even smoother so now it uses less

271
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:59,868
than four gigabytes of RAM so we're

272
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,540
really proud of that tool a lot of folks

273
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:05,629
are using that for their ad-hoc pcap

274
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,849
analysis and we hope that it does a

275
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:09,319
great job for you

276
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:13,459
so that's soo import pcap now in the

277
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:15,829
world of production sensors I'm not just

278
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,829
looking at single peak app analysis at a

279
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:21,378
time real production sensors we have now

280
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:24,349
moved from PF ring which is what we had

281
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:26,660
used in years past for kind of spinning

282
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,669
up additional instances of snort

283
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,459
sericata and bro to handle higher

284
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:34,009
traffic loads we now switch to AF packet

285
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:35,359
what that means is that we're going to

286
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:37,339
be even more powerful

287
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,769
we were in the past and we're especially

288
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:41,989
going to be smoother because we're no

289
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:44,569
longer having to rely on that P Efrain

290
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:47,389
kernel module which could periodically

291
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:49,549
cause issues on some systems so that

292
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:52,399
does make things significantly more

293
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:55,160
smoother now in listening to our

294
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,389
community a lot of folks love the fact

295
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,209
that over the last couple of years we

296
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:01,160
have heavily invested in the elastic

297
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:04,008
stack and heavily integrated with the

298
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,379
elastic stack and so a lot of folks have

299
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,360
asked us to give them the option of not

300
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,920
only the open-source version of the

301
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,110
elastic stack that we integrate by

302
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,748
default but also the capability of

303
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,059
switching into the features version of

304
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:20,480
the elastic stack that's licensed under

305
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:22,579
the elastic license so we made that as

306
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,069
quick and easy as possible it's one

307
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,689
command s o elastic features you run

308
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:29,360
that it takes care of all the dirty work

309
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:31,279
of switching your docker images behind

310
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,420
the scenes and getting that up and

311
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,790
running for you now one of the really

312
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,059
nice features that elastic provides now

313
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:45,069
for free in their basic license doesn't

314
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:47,868
cost you a dime is native elastic search

315
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:49,669
authentication which includes role based

316
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:53,480
access controls let me give you an

317
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:55,069
example one of our great customers they

318
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,139
came to us and they said hey we've got

319
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:59,779
this security operation center we've got

320
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,610
a lot of really smart analysts they get

321
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:03,169
really curious at times they like to

322
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,809
play around they like to modify

323
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:08,989
dashboards and that might cause problems

324
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:11,299
for other users so how can I kind of

325
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:14,329
lock them down and prevent those

326
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:15,499
dashboards from being modified and so as

327
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:18,709
it turns out this role based access

328
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:21,169
control allows us to do that so what we

329
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:23,299
did was we created this program again

330
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:26,269
making it as quick and easy and as

331
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:28,579
smooth as possible for folks to not only

332
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:32,239
switch to elastic features but enable

333
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:34,368
that indication and it takes all of your

334
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:36,649
existing user accounts creates those

335
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:40,100
corresponding accounts inside of elastic

336
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:42,949
and sets them as limited users by

337
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,539
default right so that way your standard

338
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,969
sock analyst they're not going to be

339
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:48,279
able to modify your dashboard

340
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,470
but you as kind of the superuser you can

341
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:53,399
still go in and make changes and manage

342
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,629
those user accounts as you see fit so

343
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,110
again we did a lot of integration work

344
00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:01,750
to make that as smooth as possible so

345
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,300
that's what it looks like in the new

346
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:08,290
Cabana interface for logging in with

347
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,930
your native elastic criticals and there

348
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,870
you can kind of see a screenshot of the

349
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,459
user management piece inside of Cabana

350
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,620
itself you can go in and modify

351
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:21,790
permissions and this user has access to

352
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,319
this and so on and so forth so that's

353
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,480
what we've done with the elastic stack

354
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,849
now let's talk about the setup process

355
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,970
itself one of the things that folks have

356
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:34,689
asked for or a really long time is the

357
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,300
ability to run setup over interactive

358
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:38,920
SSH session right traditionally our

359
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,128
setup process has been kind of

360
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,860
graphically driven it's excellent window

361
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:47,949
based so you can do x11 forwarding over

362
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,199
SSH but that might be clunky at times we

363
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:52,809
had another means of kind of automating

364
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:56,258
setup using Esso setup conch but that

365
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:58,870
had is a its own issues so really it

366
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:00,670
made sense for us to invest some time to

367
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:04,030
make this setup process go much more

368
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:07,319
smoothly over a standard SSH connection

369
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:13,270
just using standard with tail CLI and

370
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:16,270
that is a very smooth process now now at

371
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,129
the same time we made another change to

372
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,520
setup so now we have this thing called

373
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:24,640
SS setup minimal and so this really kind

374
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,400
of came out of the use case of a typical

375
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,130
home user right if you want to monitor

376
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,049
your home network you probably don't

377
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,909
want to spend thousands and thousands of

378
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,740
dollars on sensor hardware you probably

379
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:37,809
want to go to Amazon and purchase some

380
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,440
small form-factor box and it may only

381
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:43,210
have four gigabytes of RAM and so in

382
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,950
order to accommodate that use case it

383
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,900
used to be our requirements for

384
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,740
including all the elastic stack goodness

385
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:53,679
was a minimum of 8 gigabytes of RAM so

386
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,530
we took a good hard look at all of our

387
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,179
processes all of our configuration we

388
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:02,809
ended up taking our long stash

389
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:04,999
moving those into elasticsearch ingest

390
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,559
node doing all the heavy lifting there

391
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:09,289
and that allowed us to make logstash

392
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,269
much more lightweight so we can now run

393
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,249
in less than four gigabytes of RAM so

394
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:16,009
you can run Esso set up minimal and your

395
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:18,409
home network with a small form-factor

396
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:20,929
box with 4 gigabytes of RAM and it's

397
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:23,979
going to perform pretty well so we're

398
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:23,979
pretty excited about that

399
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:30,469
next up

400
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:33,139
sorry Kanna 4.15 now on the surface this

401
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:35,599
may seem like just a standard sericata

402
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:39,168
release this may not seem that much

403
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:42,678
different than sericata 4.1 for after

404
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:45,499
all it's just a point one increment of a

405
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:48,529
release however there's one key feature

406
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:51,940
that's included in story kind of 4.1.2

407
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:56,389
about in just a minute

408
00:18:51,940 --> 00:19:01,820
next up Zeke 3.0 this is the big one

409
00:18:56,389 --> 00:19:04,668
right the friends at bro slash Zeke have

410
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,099
been talking about this renaming of bro

411
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:09,259
to Zeke this is the very first version

412
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:12,559
where it's officially renamed and it's

413
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:15,679
now officially called Zeke so that was

414
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:19,639
released just what a week ago week and a

415
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:25,339
half ago we do have initial packages

416
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:27,678
built for Zeke 3.0 and we're gonna have

417
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:29,089
to do testing and feedback and things

418
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,539
like that we'll probably end up waiting

419
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:35,089
for Zeke 301 because that's just around

420
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:38,330
the corner and then we'll we'll do

421
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:40,039
testing and we'll put that out there but

422
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,279
just like I said before that sericata

423
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:45,049
has an interesting feature in 4.1.2 io

424
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,769
has an interesting feature as well

425
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:50,089
here's what it means any AWS folks in

426
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:52,879
the crowd you have a tee at AWS

427
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:55,609
deployments yeah we got some out there

428
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:58,399
so everybody asks how do you run

429
00:19:55,609 --> 00:20:01,609
security onion in the cloud typically

430
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:03,799
we've had some some possible scenarios

431
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:05,299
for doing that in the past but AWS

432
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,729
recently announced traffic mirroring

433
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:10,369
real traffic mirroring like a virtual

434
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:12,050
tap or a virtual spam court now this

435
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:14,870
comes across as of

436
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:17,450
excellent encoded stream and that's

437
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:21,439
where sericata for15 comes in because it

438
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:24,320
can do VX lan decoding and Zeke 3.0 can

439
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,080
do VX Landy Cody so now that means you

440
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:33,800
can see through the cloud and you could

441
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:35,350
say just look at that for us alright so

442
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,700
that's pretty exciting stuff

443
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:40,810
now all of that that I've talked about

444
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:44,930
so far that's kind of the traditional

445
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:48,200
security onion 1604 version that's our

446
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:50,020
current production release now you've

447
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,590
heard a couple of times today about

448
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:56,000
hybrid hunter and so we want to make

449
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,070
sure that there's an understanding here

450
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,280
that hybrid hunter is simply the

451
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:05,570
codename for the next major release for

452
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,520
security onion right this is not

453
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,379
separate from security onion it is the

454
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,440
future security onion that is simply

455
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:17,390
codenamed hybrid hunter what does all

456
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:20,090
that mean well number one today insecure

457
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,640
down in 1604 we package our software

458
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,879
using traditional a boon to Debian

459
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,120
packages ain't nobody got time for that

460
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,830
right recently I was working on a

461
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,409
package literally took me four weeks

462
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:37,100
just to get one package built correctly

463
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,930
and in today's a July environment that

464
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,270
just ain't gonna cut it any more so

465
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,370
let's move the containers we started

466
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,590
this move with the introduction of the

467
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,780
elastic stack we have the elastic stack

468
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,300
built in containers that was our way of

469
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,639
dipping our toes into the water of the

470
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,280
container ecosystem and that's been a

471
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
good experience for us we've learned a

472
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,790
lot of valuable lessons we feel like

473
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,800
we've got a good grasp on the technology

474
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:03,320
and we're ready to embrace it

475
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,960
wholeheartedly and so hybrid hunter is

476
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,159
going to be all container based those

477
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,400
containers are going to be orchestrated

478
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:13,570
with salt stack we're already using salt

479
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,940
stack today and security onion 16:04 and

480
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:20,360
now salt steak is gonna salt stack is

481
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:23,150
going to take an even greater role in

482
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,059
this new security onion hybrid hunter

483
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,219
now all that means

484
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,168
we're no longer limited to just aboot

485
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:31,329
you because we always get the question

486
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:32,199
for years and years especially from our

487
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:34,899
government friends

488
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:37,329
hey what about red hat what about sin os

489
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:39,518
that's what this is all about being able

490
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:42,188
to support not just to boot you but also

491
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:45,069
red hats in OS anywhere you can run

492
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:47,769
these containers we can we can add the

493
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:50,259
support via saltstack to be able to

494
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:53,169
integrate those containers right in and

495
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:56,469
as you've heard many times today we

496
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:59,169
realize that network visibility gets

497
00:22:56,469 --> 00:23:01,299
harder and harder we all realize that

498
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,849
and so we want to be integrating with

499
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:05,859
even more in point to limit treats you

500
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:09,849
fill in those blind spots and our

501
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:13,839
visibility alright so a brief review

502
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:15,849
about hybrid hunter and timelines of it

503
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,829
we announced hybrid hunter at last

504
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:19,208
year's security onion conference Mike

505
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:21,309
Reiss had started working on hydro

506
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:23,079
hundred back last January when he joined

507
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:24,908
the company and he did a tremendous

508
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:27,129
amount of work from January to that

509
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:29,649
conference last year and so that was

510
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:33,759
released officially November the 3rd of

511
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:35,829
last year it's hybrid hunter 101 that

512
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,329
was the initial release that was put out

513
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:39,069
there and then just a month later in

514
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:42,489
december of twenty eighteen hundred

515
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:44,649
hundred 105 included fleet for OS query

516
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:46,509
again integrating with those endpoint

517
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:48,758
technologies things that you heard Josh

518
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:51,159
talked about earlier today we made that

519
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:53,499
even better in Hydra hundred 106 which

520
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:58,809
was in January and that's this added OS

521
00:23:53,499 --> 00:24:00,939
query real rule packs and then 107 was

522
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:02,408
in April of this year and that included

523
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,449
the hive you heard about how the hive

524
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:06,429
earlier today we're really excited about

525
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:08,709
that integration of making it even

526
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:15,399
better at every single release that we

527
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:17,889
do in May we included fleet auto install

528
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:21,099
packages so Josh did some great work on

529
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:22,629
that and making sure that those packages

530
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:26,079
are already built for you and you're

531
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:27,879
able to deploy those packages out to

532
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:31,139
your endpoints and just make that as

533
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:33,939
smooth of a process as possible

534
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:36,579
now just recently in July we announced

535
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,000
hybrid hunter alpha we had finally

536
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:40,399
reached that certain

537
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,400
of features where we felt like this was

538
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,010
a good point to call this the alpha

539
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,870
release so one of the things that was

540
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,700
included in that release was a new web

541
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,100
interface called sensor Oni this was

542
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,220
kind of the replacement for Kat me if

543
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,860
you're familiar with the the current

544
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:59,780
pcap interface in security onion called

545
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,429
Kat me this is kind of the replacement

546
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,110
for that it's got a more modern

547
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,780
interface there you can see kind of the

548
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,639
packet overview you can drill into those

549
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,710
packets you get the details as you would

550
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,530
expect to see there and of course you

551
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:15,230
can also flip to an ASCII transcript

552
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:17,300
version of that and so we're really

553
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,160
excited about that Jason Earles spent a

554
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,600
good amount of time working on that he

555
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,910
did a really great job so we're really

556
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,000
appreciative to Jason for all of his

557
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:31,010
work on sensor Oni and so that was the

558
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,600
hybrid hunter alpha release but all of

559
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:35,660
that stuff that we've just talked about

560
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,429
is all in the rear view mirror and I

561
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:43,040
said before that we want to be forward

562
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:46,070
thinkers so now let's talk about what's

563
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:50,120
in front of us ladies and gentlemen

564
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:54,139
today we are excited to announce hybrid

565
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:56,780
hunter alpha two drops today this is

566
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,610
hybrid hunter 1.1.1 it includes Surrey

567
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:02,990
cotta four one five with that great VX

568
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:06,350
Land decoding it includes row 264 the

569
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,550
hive three four zero improved grip on of

570
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,230
integration we didn't talk too much

571
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,360
about refiner earlier but that's a great

572
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,310
way of keeping track of the health of

573
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,649
your security onion hybrid hunter

574
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,100
deployment and so Mike has done a really

575
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,450
great job on making sure that Gravano is

576
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,699
amazing right out of the box since

577
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:29,710
Huronia is now faster and smoother than

578
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:32,750
it was before we talked before about

579
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,820
taking our log stash parsers and moving

580
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,920
them into elasticsearch ingest node

581
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,139
we're now doing that in hybrid hunter as

582
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,890
well right which makes our parsing

583
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,920
faster it uses less resources so it's a

584
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:47,780
much higher performance environment lots

585
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,380
and lots of bug fixes we've been on a

586
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,240
bug squashing

587
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,679
tor for the past couple of weeks of

588
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,460
trying to make sure that this is as

589
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,840
stable and as reliable as possible and

590
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,030
then also you heard this morning Josh

591
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,428
Brown are talking about playbooks and

592
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,500
tack navigating all that cool stuff that

593
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:07,049
he talked about guess what all that's

594
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:13,110
already built in to security onion

595
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:15,179
hybrid hunter alpha 2 and finally the

596
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,428
big point of this release is that Mike

597
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:20,340
Reeves has worked tirelessly on building

598
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:21,900
a minimal ISO image to make this even

599
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,240
easier than it was before before you

600
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,850
would take your own abouttwo or your own

601
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,530
slash you would clone our github repo

602
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,629
you would run a script and go through

603
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,178
something he's made that process even

604
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:36,419
easier even smoother she can download

605
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:38,220
this minimal ISO image note that it is a

606
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,980
minimal ISO image meaning that it will

607
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,640
still need internet access so you can't

608
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,350
do this in air-gapped environments but

609
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,450
we think it'll be the fastest and

610
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:53,549
smoothest installation of hybrid hunter

611
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:55,620
to date so that's what we're dropping

612
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:57,840
today so now let's talk about the future

613
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,489
what does the roadmap look like well

614
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,250
we're currently working on a user

615
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,950
authentication subsystem so we hope to

616
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:07,500
get that integrated very very soon for

617
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:10,260
folks that are tracking RedHat AIT's in

618
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,919
OS 8 so NOS 8 just dropped very recently

619
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:15,150
we've already done the initial work to

620
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,710
try to figure out what it's going to

621
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,840
take for us to support that it's going

622
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:24,000
to mean some changes for our existing

623
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,918
images and integrations but we have a

624
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,320
couple of paths forwards on that you

625
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,850
know which we know how we can achieve

626
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,129
success there so we're looking forward

627
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,620
to fully supporting CIN OS 8 on the very

628
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:38,640
near future we're looking forward to

629
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:41,129
more integrations and more tuning but we

630
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,570
need testing and we need feedback all

631
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,669
right we don't want to be developing

632
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,350
this in a vacuum we want to make sure

633
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:49,500
that we're developing something that's

634
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:51,870
relevant for you in your environments so

635
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,419
it's not production ready we don't want

636
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,239
you to be relying on it for production

637
00:28:54,419 --> 00:29:00,540
usage but if you can spin it up in your

638
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,559
environment and give it a good test with

639
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,450
some really good real try

640
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,570
and give us some feedback on how it

641
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,019
works for you we would really really

642
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,019
appreciate that

643
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:20,309
so that's all of our software stuff but

644
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:23,379
as always there is just one more thing

645
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:27,940
last year we did announce Hardware

646
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:29,709
appliances at the conference and folks

647
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,350
have been really really excited about

648
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,740
hardware appliances and we've had a lot

649
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:37,299
of interest in a lot of the men in that

650
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,990
one of the things that we have done is

651
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:43,480
that we have built a new high throughput

652
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:46,809
appliance which we just received the

653
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,210
prototype yesterday afternoon so we will

654
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:50,918
have this on display tomorrow at besides

655
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,659

we haven't done any official benchmarks

661
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,159
but based on the specs of this machine

662
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,889
it's a beast

663
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,419
it's a Bertha it's a workhorse we're

664
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:11,590

665
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:15,809

questions yes sir

670
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:43,880
so the question is user authentication

671
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:46,850
subsystem will be integration with LDAP

672
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,890
that's not something that we have in the

673
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:52,840
initial release it might be something

674
00:30:48,890 --> 00:31:06,470
that we could look at in future releases

675
00:30:52,840 --> 00:31:09,799
any other questions yes sir absolutely

676
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:11,960
