62
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,350
important folks my parents are here

63
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:51,410

66
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:00,018
go so my parents bought me my first

67
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:02,000
computer when I was six years old and if

68
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:04,310
they hadn't done that if that had not

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,260
happened this would not have happened

70
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,330
right so I'm very appreciative for that

71
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,160
and of course my lovely wife Trish Burks

72
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,750
who I don't believe is here yet but if

73
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,880
you see her sometime today make sure to

74
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,100
give her a high five or a fist bump for

75
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,079
putting up with me especially during

76
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,739
busy weeks like this week which is the

77
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:24,320
busiest week of the entire year so thank

78
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:27,739
you all to all of these many folks for

79
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,350
helping us do what we do and really make

80
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,850
it a community effort so I think that's

81
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,430
all the things that I have if I

82
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:38,180
forgotten anything all right so it

83
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,930
occurs to me that well number one I have

84
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,930
a confession to make

85
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,099
don't tell anybody and I would imagine

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,170
that one or two of you may self-identify

87
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,849
as an introvert as well and with the

88
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,069
number of folks who raised their hands

89
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,409
as out-of-town visitors I would imagine

90
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:02,069
that you don't know everybody in this

91
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:04,709
room so what I thought we would do is

92
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:07,500
take just a minute I want everybody to

93
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,940
stand up and I want you to find somebody

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,489
that you've never met in your entire

95
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,769
life before and I want you to introduce

96
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,840
yourself so we're building community

97
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,970
here today starting right first thing in

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:24,180
the morning so welcome everybody

99
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,180
[Applause]
