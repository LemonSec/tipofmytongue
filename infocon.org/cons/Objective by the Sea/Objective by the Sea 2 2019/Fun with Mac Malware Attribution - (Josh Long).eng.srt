1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,290
my talk is titled fun with Mac malware

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,340
attribution and I had a lot of fun

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,350
preparing this talk so I hope that you

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,959
will enjoy it as much as I love this

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:19,609
talk so a little bit about me

6
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:21,169
this is turning into text on slide I

7
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:22,160
apologize

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,849
the short version of this is that I have

9
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:28,929
the chief security analyst if it's ago I

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,150
been working you know doing security

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,000
research for about 20 years or so give

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,090
or take and I've been doing it

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,070
professionally well let's say I started

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,270
writing about security topics about 10

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:53,090
years ago and since then Security's been

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,390
an aspect of my job and then a lot of my

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,470
my previous places that I worked and now

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,800
I get to do a full language is awesome

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,840
and so that's a little bit about me

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,030
so let's get to the fun stuff who makes

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,920
manic on where and why these were the

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,560
things we're gonna cover what are some

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,810
in the channel our keys and attributing

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,170
Mac malware to or any battler to an

25
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,840
author to an individual and then I'll

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,850
dress the the inevitable question of

27
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,479
does this presentation help the bad guys

28
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,069
will talk about why attribution matters

29
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:36,829
and then we'll get into the really good

30
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:39,439
stuff which is the case studies where

31
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,990
we'll talk about specific examples of

32
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,569
people who have slipped up and what we

33
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:48,469
were able to find out about them so

34
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,030
first of all who makes malware and why

35
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,200
what are the motivations that these

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,709
people have so historically that there

37
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,689
bit of course a lot of different reasons

38
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,429
why people created malware sometimes

39
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:04,609
they do it have curiosity sometimes for

40
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:07,569
their own software aggrandizement

41
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,979
recently I would say the majority of

42
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,349
drama that we see these days has two

43
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:16,000
main motivations and the first is

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,030
monetary for example malware the

45
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,340
attempts to steal money such as banking

46
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,290
Trojans or cryptocurrency wallets

47
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,650
dealers in order to abuse someone else's

48
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,750
computing resources for the attackers

49
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,970
profit for example crypto jackets and

50
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,320
things like that the other motivation

51
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,770
that we see a wise political innovations

52
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,480
some malware benefits military or

53
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,430
intelligence agencies these may include

54
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,709
malware scienter espionage or in other

55
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,470
words state-sponsored spyware or for

56
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,190
sabotage things like Stuxnet things

57
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,590
designed to affect nuclear or other

58
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,630
facilities or industrial control systems

59
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,430
and things like that so what are some of

60
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,520
the challenges figuring out who created

61
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,610
malware's is always easy and some cyber

62
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,980
criminals are just better than others

63
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,800
are covering their tracks in some cases

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,180
more advanced cyber criminals try to

65
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,950
mask or sow doubt about their true

66
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,570
identity through something called false

67
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,060
flags or they intentionally plant

68
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,410
misinformation into their code or you

69
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,630
know in other places to try these to see

70
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,170
researchers and throw them off the scent

71
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,170
yeah in some cases they may even put the

72
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,299
name of another researcher that they're

73
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,360
you know wanting mess around in their

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,370
file and then you know malware

75
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,220
developers often reuse code as well or

76
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,730
exploits that are found in other malware

77
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,989
sometimes they do it for convenience and

78
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,610
sometimes it's part of that false flag

79
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,090
thing to to make it appear that the new

80
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,280
malware is affiliated with an earlier in

81
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,280
our campaign and sometimes it's for both

82
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,070
seasons so let's help the bad guys by

83
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,019
giving them tips on let's go boy and

84
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,450
that kind of thing in my opinion no

85
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,760
really the techniques documented in this

86
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,670
talk are not brand new these are you

87
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,970
know just a few things that we've

88
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,070
observed but there are many many

89
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,410
resources on digital forensics and

90
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,780
Incident Response as well as open source

91
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,910
intelligence that explore these concepts

92
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,990
some techniques in much greater depth

93
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,530
however I do hope that this talk will be

94
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,090
helpful to and potential malware

95
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,650
creators by giving them a wake-up call

96
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,660
that if they choose to make malware

97
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,660
they'll probably get caught so when

98
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,970
cyber criminals realize how difficult it

99
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,060
is to avoid ever making even one simple

100
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,470
mistake that can lead to the discovery

101
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,930
of their true identity which may in some

102
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,610
cases lead to their arrest and

103
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,350
imprisonment or week apart them to

104
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,090
establish a good reputation for

105
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,220
themselves and their later careers it

106
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,440
becomes a lot less enticing to make and

107
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,390
distribute malware

108
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:12,190
having said that daxing is a not a good

109
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,470
practice and this is where human

110
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,210
individuals suspected and being involved

111
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,080
in a crime might have a highly sensitive

112
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,540
information about themselves to release

113
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,930
publicly and first up some not a nice

114
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,040
thing to do so let's get to the good

115
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,480
stuff the part you've been waiting for

116
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,360
the five real-world case studies where

117
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,220
we'll talk about real Mac malware and

118
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,560
how it has been linked to their creators

119
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,430
true identities so the first one we'll

120
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,750
talk about is cold root rat

121
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,910
coal group was a remote access Trojan

122
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,490
designed to trick victims into giving

123
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,400
full remote administrator privileges to

124
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,460
an attacker with built-in capabilities

125
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,830
such as keystroke logging and really

126
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,450
everything else that you might expect to

127
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,490
see rattled and Patrick wrote about his

128
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,140
research on this topic in early 2016

129
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,660
and one of the things that he wrote

130
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,090
about was that he discovered a 27 minute

131
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,790
YouTube video that was uploaded a couple

132
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,320
of years earlier by the malware

133
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,530
developer at peace hacker handle was as

134
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,570
displayed throughout the video cold zero

135
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,830
and in the comments on the video called

136
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,780
Sarah mentioned a website cold routes

137
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,880
calm so I was writing an article about

138
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,940
the colder draft and I was curious to

139
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,420
learn

140
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,840
hold zero and so I thought well why not

141
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,510
check out what has ever existed on cold

142
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,360
root comp so I went to the Internet

143
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Archive Wayback Machine and tried this

144
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,540
is really basic open source intelligence

145
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,980
tactic if you can even call it that I

146
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,200
just wanted to see what I could learn

147
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,280
and to my surprise cold zero had

148
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,200
formerly used the domain that has his

149
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,600
own personal home page I've completed

150
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,570
with his real nickname a photograph of

151
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,910
himself and links to his LinkedIn

152
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,220
YouTube Google+ and Facebook profiles

153
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,650
and by the way all of those profiles

154
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,530
used his hacker nickname called zero so

155
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,450
yeah so I had a decision to make sure he

156
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,230
shared his real name in my article

157
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,520
curiosity I googled this hacker handle

158
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
and reeling together and got an

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,550
interesting results it turned out that a

160
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,830
security blogger at data breaches net

161
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,750
had called out cold zero by his real

162
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,450
name publicly a couple years earlier for

163
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,760
his hacking activities basically what

164
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,880
this guy did was he had some forums and

165
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,790
you know it hacked by holes you know

166
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,190
right and so this blogger said okay

167
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,840
that's interesting cold zero so he

168
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,080
googled it and you know was able to

169
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,330
probably find the same things that I did

170
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,970
and so he wrote a little bit about about

171
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,880
this guy his article so since Muhammad

172
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,130
Osama which was his name already been

173
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,890
identified as called zero by himself

174
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,920
actually on his own website and also

175
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,480
since this information was published

176
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,820
elsewhere I mentioned his name in my in

177
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,070
my article well they turned out he

178
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:39,340
didn't like that so he contacted indigo

179
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,500
claiming that he did not own the domain

180
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,820
at the time that it was used in

181
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,950
connection with corporate wrap a person

182
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,090
I've already done my due diligence

183
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,580
before publishing and a couple chefs but

184
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,680
who is revered of history for the domain

185
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,740
so it was definitely the same guy

186
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,810
there is there was no way that it could

187
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,310
have not faded there had been no change

188
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,070
in domain ownership in fact Osama

189
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,750
continued to use the domain with his

190
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,550
nickname called zero even after he

191
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,560
stopped using a site as the homepage for

192
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:18,400
a whole group right all right so if

193
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,930
something by the way continues to use

194
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,510
his cold zero identity he describes

195
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,820
himself as an hour hunter and exploit

196
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,800
developer and as if the last time you

197
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,200
updated Twitter in September 2018 he

198
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,840
said he was looking for John alright so

199
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,540
number two k-state - we've got apple

200
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,360
juice operation apple juice marked the

201
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,400
first time that Lazarus group which is

202
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,220
hacking semen ties to North Korea had

203
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,130
targeted Mac OS with its fall children

204
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,820
our fault Chilton Mac OS in the form of

205
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,950
a Trojan horse a crypto currency app

206
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,050
from a shell company called sale is

207
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,800
limited or cos policy to get info window

208
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,020
of the app revealed one name in

209
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,880
connection with the malware John Brooks

210
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,050
with an X the name also appeared by the

211
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,850
way in who is records for the sealless

212
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,460
LLC domain and as it turns out Brooks

213
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,910
with an X is extremely uncommon and

214
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,150
possibly a made-up surname however

215
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,130
another name surfaced that was a lot

216
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,390
more interesting and that name was well

217
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,360
I know actually not that long ago I

218
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,310
couldn't resist I'm sorry

219
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,260
and so I know those episodes looking it

220
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,200
up the some details about the Windows

221
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,390
variants in this hour I looked on

222
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,140
virustotal

223
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,350
and I noticed something kind of

224
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,890
suspicious so this malware when it was

225
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,150
first uploaded the the date and time you

226
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,100
know comparing it it was it was uploaded

227
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,350
the first time three hours after the

228
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,950
apps creation time so I thought okay I

229
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,210
wonder what that could mean

230
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,780
and then within minutes the so basically

231
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,380
as soon as the viral

232
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,200
the virustotal analysis was complete the

233
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,750
files worked - saved by two community

234
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,040
members John Brooks and the third guy

235
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,519
while it Darwish so evidently someone

236
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,990
involved with the creation of the

237
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,390
malware was testing to see whether it

238
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,100
would be flagged by any popular

239
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,959
animators engines before releasing the

240
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,390
malware in the wild and trying to

241
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,220
increase the files credibility by adding

242
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,019
positive reviews so it's not really

243
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,060
necessary because it wasn't flagged by

244
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,420
any impacts products at the time anyway

245
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,300
but now you know how you got a new name

246
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,940
to research Walla garbage so let's see

247
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,790
what you're gonna learn about him

248
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,240
waleed our wish had a spended legitimate

249
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,850
looking LinkedIn and Twitter profiles I

250
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,279
found it interesting that he was a third

251
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,589
degree connection to me on LinkedIn

252
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,769
so that means evidently I know someone

253
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,500
who knows someone who knows him which

254
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,970
sort of lends credence to the

255
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,980
possibility that he may actually be a

256
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,160
real person assuming that he is a real

257
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,170
person it's unclear whether you knew

258
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,820
about the connections of last words

259
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,980
before developing code for the Selah

260
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,709
straight Pro pack or whether he was

261
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,570
simply a developer who was unknowing

262
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,220
that he hired by a thread after and

263
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,020
sieved into making the software that

264
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,970
would subsequently be exploited and

265
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,440
recognized so we don't know but he has

266
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,810
been completely silent on social media

267
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,459
since the discovery of this and ours

268
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,140
profiles are still there but yes the

269
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:46,490
posted anything since they are so

270
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,130
creative updater this is case study

271
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,610
number three and if anybody happened to

272
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,260
see Objective C retweeted my Twitter

273
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,130
posts earlier this week I said that I

274
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,320
found something really interesting at

275
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,360
the last minute that I wanted to ask the

276
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,050
top so this is it the creative update or

277
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,029
malware consistent of trojan eyes

278
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,540
versions of three apps mozilla firefox

279
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,339
browser and two titanium software

280
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,310
utility apps which

281
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,500
on its and deeper and they were

282
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,529
mistakenly distributed by Mac up the

283
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,600
software download site in February of

284
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,890
2018 the Trenton eyes disk image was

285
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,230
signed by an apple developer ID account

286
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,380
Ramos Jackson which later had signing

287
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,200
certificate revoked by Apple of course

288
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,360
notably as is often the case with Apple

289
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,580
developer IDs down in connection with

290
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,290
malware the given name and surname

291
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,060
appeared to be in their horse order from

292
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,610
typical Western practice in this case

293
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,650
the developed the the given game would

294
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,320
most likely be Jackson and the surname

295
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,500
Ramos in little additional information

296
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,770
has been uncovered about Robbie's today

297
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,200
but another name service a few different

298
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,020
places in connection with the Malheur

299
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,640
one of the look like domains through

300
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,660
which the malware was distributed had an

301
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,230
admin username that contained Thiago

302
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:21,160
Mateos 1985 and I know about Teague

303
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,730
pointed out a fun forensic trick

304
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,270
analyzing the hidden

305
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,190
DX order file on a disk image volume can

306
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,770
show you some interesting things

307
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,570
including the original path of the dmg

308
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,950
file and that trick revealed to other

309
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,350
variations of the name so we had Thiago

310
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,290
Brenda M and also Java development tapes

311
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,020
so we have like a full name now and one

312
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,560
of these these rings so way back in

313
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,470
February 2018 in in Patrick's my post

314
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,890
he said interesting I wonder who Tiago

315
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,550
by Dilma Tennyson's and I completely

316
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,320
forgot about this until earlier this

317
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,420
week I have to define it in some notes

318
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:17,550
that I taken about this topic and I said

319
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,250
okay challenge accepted

320
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,709
I think I can I can take this on so

321
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,820
let's see what we can find out so I'm

322
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,260
presented here for the first time and

323
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,160
objective by the sea

324
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,720
again these are super basic techniques

325
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,210
right and just doing a search often

326
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,310
reveals a ton of information about

327
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,800
somebody if you have a fairly unique

328
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,650
name or some particular things that make

329
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,650
it likely to tie to that person in

330
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,380
particular so I searched doctor go for

331
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,960
John Farrar Dale Mateus and this

332
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,910
original stood out to me for some reason

333
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,250
well we know that Thiago likes to

334
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,200
register domain names since he did that

335
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,810
for the creative theater campaign so

336
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,210
this could be a possible match and we're

337
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,790
domain but you know who knows I might as

338
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,300
well check it out right so there was a

339
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,760
full email address Lister and so I

340
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,090
thought let's see if I can find the

341
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,250
username portion of the address he wants

342
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,720
and I did yes who was a registered user

343
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,440
at geared to hacker of Brazil's hackers

344
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,020
guide forms yeah

345
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,510
tig designer which you might have

346
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,860
noticed was the first part of that email

347
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,250
address hey so you know his real aim is

348
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,690
job with run gentleman tips

349
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,800
oh and look um he was kind enough to

350
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,980
burn the share his real birth dates on a

351
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:55,580
hacker form yes I actually found a

352
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,050
surprising amount of personal

353
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,090
identifiable information and sensitive

354
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,040
information about him and again this is

355
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,089
all redacted but some of the things

356
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,940
included precise home address in stock

357
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,970
all of Brazil this is what his apartment

358
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,650
complex looks like I'm doing Street View

359
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,420
and the possible landline home telephone

360
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,450
number I haven't tried calling it I

361
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,950
don't know what I would say to them

362
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,150
exactly Java currently owns or is a

363
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,619
managing partner of several small

364
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,090
business ventures some of which are

365
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,180
registered to his home address and he is

366
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,700
registered dozens of calm calm down be

367
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,240
our domain names and I also encountered

368
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,410
the 2014

369
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,270
we're done bomb pastebin containing a

370
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,550
password that he may have used once

371
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,200
which by the way with six characters

372
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,990
yeah all right

373
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,140
appearance so case study number four

374
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,710
purity is an ad word family that does

375
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,900
the number of nasty things to infected

376
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,810
maps and it means surfer has done a lot

377
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,390
great research into it I encourage you

378
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,460
to check out his white papers about this

379
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,250
and also he has a slide deck from

380
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,160
talking to gave at RSA Conference about

381
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,470
this subject as well so they're going to

382
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,380
check this out if you haven't already so

383
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,940
after he had bunch of dead ends was

384
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,400
trying to identify hers creator Amin

385
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,080
used a terminal command to list the

386
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,750
contents of a tgz archive that was

387
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,600
dropped but now and this actually wasn't

388
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,420
something that he intended to find out

389
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,270
he was just he says he was just doing

390
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,520
this to be lazy because he didn't really

391
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,260
want to fire our app in Vienna or turn

392
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,110
off his his antivirus software so he

393
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,090
just used a command to list the contents

394
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,380
of his TGV file and the output happened

395
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,240
to display the username of the archives

396
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,690
creative and that username happens to be

397
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,370
the real person last name on the

398
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,600
aggregate Albert so through a Google

399
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
search for the name server learns that

400
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,160
the creator of the malware archive

401
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,500
worked for a company called targeting

402
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,300
edge who in it's linked in description

403
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,580
obviously perfectly matches a company

404
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,190
that we developed this kind of a blur

405
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,020
and server revealed it you go interview

406
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,300
that the developers subsequently started

407
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,380
using my user accounts called Batman

408
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,560
after this because you know you've been

409
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,510
exposed to already once and so no and he

410
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,640
thought okay well start using a

411
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,500
different username when I create

412
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,350
archives for this not for my network

413
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,760
okay so bad isn't that were creator

414
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,480
there

415
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,200
interesting January 2017 a different

416
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,970
developer who worked at targeting edge

417
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,020
applied for a job at cyber reason which

418
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,710
is surfers company and they keep posted

419
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,600
the guy that apply to his job posted on

420
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,940
the CV that his work had been the focus

421
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:16,420
of a cyber reason reports ok weird flex

422
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,470
okay and the last one is fruit fly this

423
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,280
is a case study number five and just

424
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,830
really quickly on the FBI tracked down a

425
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,110
guy named Phillip harder since Keith the

426
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,910
creator of the fruit fly came

427
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,090
commissioned malware which dirges gain

428
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,980
have been using for 14 years to spy on

429
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,410
victims in various places of the United

430
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,820
States although not all of the FBI's

431
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,200
methodology is for research or known to

432
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,360
the public it is clear that obviously

433
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,950
they had a lot more resources than the

434
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,970
average novel researcher and Thomas

435
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,410
Street by the way has been following his

436
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,750
case and he told me that dirtiest key is

437
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,010
still awaiting trouble so what have we

438
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,180
learned quite offering malware

439
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,520
attribution is not as difficult as one

440
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,210
might expect so here's my parting

441
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,370
message to anyone who may be considering

442
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,260
creating malware and thinks they can get

443
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:45,860
away with all right so the white paper

444
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,360
hasn't been posted yet there's a white

445
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,750
paper that goes along with that we'll

446
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,240
have links to this sentence discussed

447
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,790
here in and

448
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,680
I know not security people I want to

449
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,880
thank you

450
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,440
all right in these days and special

451
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,480
thanks to the people listed here for the

452
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,800
research and/or feedback on this talk

453
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,379
and we've got time left for questions

454
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,499
[Music]

455
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,080
my name is Connie Mitchell burning new

456
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,060
plants are affected by the scene nice to

457
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,130
meet you catchment my job sucks great

458
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,410
presentation thank you my question is

459
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,810
really around just general trends when

460
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,590
it comes to malware targeting Mac OS in

461
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,960
particular we're noticing a beautiful

462
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,330
garden that a lot of Mac's are making a

463
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,770
way into the inner products particularly

464
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,960
in I would say high-value executives R&D

465
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,030
groups and so on and we still seem to

466
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,250
hear from alcohol and it's certainly

467
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,220
perpetuated a security you know press as

468
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,360
well as I do

469
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,940
mainstream presses and how the Mac is

470
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,790
like nobody's know what are your general

471
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,280
ideas or thoughts the trends in general

472
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,800
and how preached of enterprises be that

473
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,870
so many their executives high-value

474
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:22,370
targets are walking yeah this is a

475
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,850
question that I think comes up a lot and

476
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,160
I think one of the things to that's

477
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,560
worth pointing out is that over the past

478
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,040
year we've really seen I think over the

479
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,440
past year has been a true good uptick in

480
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,970
the frequency and and really consistency

481
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,730
of new Mac now will be discovered or

482
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,640
being released into the wild

483
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,400
this is something that we're only gonna

484
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,260
see more of it's not going to decrease

485
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,570
because it is mentioned there are a lot

486
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,760
of high value targets that use maps and

487
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,860
frankly

488
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,050
Apple hasn't been tested the way that

489
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,980
Microsoft has you know Microsoft went

490
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,340
through

491
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,999
many many years of shame and

492
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:12,429
embarrassment as their platform you know

493
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:16,019
window is that vision exploited and

494
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,409
finally through secure coding and a lot

495
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:23,469
of internal work at Microsoft they

496
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:26,399
they've changed things around and so now

497
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:29,739
one could actually argue that Windows is

498
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:33,820
a safer platform than Mac OS because

499
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,129
Microsoft departments so much and

500
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:39,899
because Apple hasn't hardened enough and

501
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:43,899
so you know there's there's a question

502
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,549
of you know people like to point out

503
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,229
well there's so much more malware

504
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:49,299
available for Windows amen

505
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:52,179
yeah that's true in terms of like

506
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:54,599
quantity but that doesn't mean that

507
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:57,039
Windows is any more likely to get

508
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,399
infected than map you know it's

509
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,669
definitely the case that just you know

510
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,889
doing Google searches for the wrong

511
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:08,019
thing you might end up on a site that's

512
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:11,559
going to drive-by download infect your

513
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,889
computer if you don't understand that

514
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,079
your computer's doesn't need flash

515
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,539
players for example and a lot of people

516
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:21,099
really don't they just don't understand

517
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:23,589
concepts like that so we see that kind

518
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,779
of thing happening all the time and

519
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,819
those executives are going to be those

520
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,829
people who fall for those things as well

521
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:34,959
so it's I say now more than ever it's

522
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:37,599
very important for people to to think

523
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,399
carefully about protecting their

524
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,239
endpoints even their mapping points it's

525
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,519
if you're not running it in virus

526
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,159
software any more than Hooker and least

527
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:59,949
using Objective C tools a plug point in

528
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:01,959
the Skip intuition so those are like

529
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,639
four or five accountants right but is

530
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:06,069
that like that crappy object that sort

531
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,709
of train with the format and Mac malware

532
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:10,659
and it's the same question kind of lead

533
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,279
it to what you just talked about so like

534
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,919
on Windows that you'll be think about

535
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,169
now there's like 20 years away right but

536
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,170
you think that the like

537
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,870
these guys really rank amateurs because

538
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,450
like there's no a lot of weight league

539
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,490
there is so professional Matt Lauer well

540
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,470
do you think this crappy old state is a

541
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,750
result in fact before like the vast

542
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,180
majority forgave malware for mine are

543
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,330
just like just by encounters like okay

544
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,190
so I holes are great because they love

545
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,610
it

546
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,370
drill me I think this first the first

547
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,500
question goes you know I personally

548
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,720
haven't really researched it any other

549
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,250
not know besides the I suspect that if

550
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,290
we were to research the other malware

551
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,790
samples in the same way I would probably

552
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,710
see a lot of the same things it's just

553
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,300
it's just the reality it's very very

554
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:14,340
hard to hide your identity and so on the

555
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,620
other hand you know there was a what

556
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,330
some might call sophisticated threat

557
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,400
actor in there right there's this lavish

558
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,760
group and they've made mistakes too or

559
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,090
else they threw a developer under the

560
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,840
bus or whatever the case might be but

561
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,410
you know that's I think kind of

562
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,630
interesting to think about so what was

563
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,050
the second question

564
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,199
[Music]

565
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,340
yeah um again it's a great question I

566
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,420
don't know that we have all the answers

567
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,210
to that I think that obviously there's a

568
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,890
lot more research that could be done to

569
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,520
really dig into other nut malware and

570
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,140
see whether this is something that's

571
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,750
common across you know the majority of

572
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,330
math malware I kind of suspect that it

573
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:15,780
probably is but but you never know so do

574
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,850
your research I mean have fun with it

575
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,210
like I did and I need it and several

576
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,480
others
