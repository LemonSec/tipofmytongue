1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,599
yeah I might have Sam I'm a security

2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,019
engineer they're gonna be and I've been

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:13,540
thinking for a long time just in the

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,460
back of my head if I were gonna write

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,830
some malware like what would I want to

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,720
do with it and what we might focus on so

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,699
I'm not a tip what security researcher

8
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,970
I'm I came up as an admin and now I'm

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,099
screwed engineer so we go to little

10
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,200
different focus a background with other

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,859
people here but I kind of thought that

12
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:37,690
the most interesting things that you

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,629
could do today with malware with it

14
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:44,550
thank you agree so like a little

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,870
basically rerun occupies like in the

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,760
beginning there was a root and there was

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,469
nothing more powerful than there is

18
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:55,390
anything they wanted to on the Mac and

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,839
that was just it for like the first 10

20
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:03,570
11 years of its time and into Mac OS but

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,090
apples kind of figured out that route

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,520
has been more powerful than it probably

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,370
should have been and a few years ago

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,420
that came out of system integrity

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,430
protection this is a few other features

26
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,300
like requiring code panic or texts but

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,900
really the implications for malware

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,280
aren't that much all set really does in

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,190
my mind is just like keeps you from

30
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:36,130
deleting chess and this might matter to

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,500
you if you're like a huge organization

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,240
that doesn't trust your employees that

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,560
never do you work because they're just

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,740
going to play chess all day but I don't

35
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,170
think they're Malik's it really matters

36
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,620
that much so in Mojave

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,540
Apple came out with CCC transfer consent

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,890
and control and this was really about

39
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,030
protecting these are data from

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,170
applications at Chinon access to its

41
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,770
sure and I think that which does have

42
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,910
real implications from out where but not

43
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,650
the kind of matter that I would want to

44
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,170
write so what is TCC there

45
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,150
it really protects files on the disk on

46
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,250
in directories so that applications

47
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,590
aren't authorized to be done can't read

48
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,710
them so in this case Peru you can't read

49
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,430
the Highnesses database other user

50
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,720
that's kind of unfortunate you can't

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,120
believe it anymore but whatever we'll

52
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,780
write our malware to do something so

53
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,050
what I've really just thought about is

54
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,160
is it rootless or route less like what

55
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,690
is what is the less really means and at

56
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,790
this point we're in group that can do

57
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,050
less so it really is so it so if you do

58
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,440
a lot of interesting things and like on

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,290
many systems it's just words for the

60
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,459
taking so let's talk about that look

61
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,400
like looking still do that's interesting

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,209
in a case of not work so they're gonna

63
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,690
fall launch demons to persist you know

64
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,860
it's pretty simple on I think

65
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,830
modifying instead trusted routes so that

66
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,870
we can intercept software you can block

67
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,959
communication or if they're in DM either

68
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,150
by removing the profile if it's not dep

69
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,170
or just on blocking it through the PF

70
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,080
firewall or just modifying a host live

71
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,959
you can still do that we can unload all

72
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,459
those security tools that are protect

73
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,600
you from malware so whether that's the

74
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,790
launch humans or unloading the text we

75
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,410
can't load any new pets that are

76
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,370
wait-listed

77
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,380
but you can unload them so that's nice

78
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,540
we can spell authorization plugins to

79
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,440
get the users password and then grab

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,570
their keychain upload them somewhere and

81
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,630
they don't like passwords I really don't

82
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,380
understand why authorization plugins are

83
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,000
still permitted maybe that will change

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,358
tomorrow Mike Lissy

85
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,880
we can enable file ball to like this is

86
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,140
great for if we wanted to write a

87
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,200
cricket locker and there's like so much

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
more

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,850
and it's not really hard from how are

90
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,340
you here on something else like you can

91
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,620
really just ask for it and most users

92
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,080
are probably just gonna give it to you

93
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,880
but what we didn't have to ask for it um

94
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,620
it's like we're out use every way that

95
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,780
can now be really great in the case of

96
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,090
malware because you know these pop-ups

97
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,710
they're a little sketchy and people

98
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,200
forget their passwords or maybe our

99
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,720
admin and you know probably some user if

100
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,580
you're in a large organization and you

101
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,920
target it that's kind of where someone's

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,480
going to notice that I would say

103
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,290
something but let's do without that my

104
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,460
green escalations

105
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,630
have been in Mac OS for a long time and

106
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,160
people still focus on them here's the

107
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,400
vulnerability earlier this year in

108
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,320
feedback assistant where it would calm

109
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,950
we would run as cables that were that

110
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,490
may have been writable by other users

111
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,440
and the simple reverse collation and

112
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,700
that's cool because it's it's building

113
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,330
sort of Mac unless and and like this is

114
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,350
what a man looks like at a box but I

115
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,270
don't know anybody's market actually

116
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,990
works like that most people's max trying

117
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,220
to look like this and they have like all

118
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,550
this stuff on them they've got

119
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,170
applications and applications and more

120
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,720
applications and it just goes on and on

121
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,830
and this third-party software is just

122
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,700
like bad

123
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,740
you probably shouldn't trust third-party

124
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,430
software with root because you don't

125
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,490
really know what they're gonna do with

126
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,750
it it's like you shouldn't you shouldn't

127
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,460
trust those rights off with that with

128
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,400
root without fully analyzing what it's

129
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,220
doing so

130
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,620
let's talk about some examples where

131
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,090
that's really fond of these might be so

132
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,250
here's an application on which I

133
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,230
discovered was vulnerable to you know

134
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,100
vulnerable to root escalations by having

135
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,950
functions being bad so this is an

136
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,080
application which you drag and drop your

137
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,190
Applications folder and as we know for

138
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,980
the last few releases of Mac OS users

139
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,780
have the ability to install it the

140
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,400
victims the Applications folder without

141
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,580
authors that you may have access to they

142
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,320
can do that we're gonna drag and drop it

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,200
and then no authorization dialogue is

144
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,810
ever gonna pop up so we do that they

145
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,450
follow instructions and they right click

146
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,360
it and click open because this is not

147
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,570
code signing because that's really hard

148
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,190
to do and you open it up and you get

149
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,820
this dialog and after you type the

150
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,010
password name and it installs and

151
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,760
launching so the launch team that

152
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,080
installs looks like this and it points

153
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,610
to an executable that's inside of that

154
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,980
inside an application bundle and it's

155
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,210
fine except on modern versions of Mac OS

156
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,880
that file is going to be writable by the

157
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,300
user so malware could just come along

158
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,730
and change that file and the next time

159
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,150
launch team initializes it's been run

160
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,790
that as root so pretty simple through

161
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,640
escalation these are the extremely

162
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,950
common in drag and drop on kind of

163
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,040
applications so if you ever drag and

164
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,570
drop an application or your Applications

165
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,929
folder and pops up over any

166
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,950
authorization dialogue and should

167
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,179
probably question what it's actually

168
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,479
doing but maybe we should talk about

169
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,700
something that's more common than this

170
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:47,610
non cosign application and that does

171
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,290
this

172
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,360
you know I hope that most people in this

173
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,420
room would kind of question you know the

174
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,250
salon coats like half that on but then

175
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,610
pops with an authorization like you know

176
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,260
that something is kind of sketchy

177
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,420
they've had a sketchy looking disk image

178
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,610
so something more common than that so

179
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,930
I'm gonna guess that most people here

180
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,350
whose phone number is a great tool if

181
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,580
you want to install

182
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,450
you know Python 3 or other programs that

183
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,270
don't comment and I'm sure the homebrew

184
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,950
sells a lot of maths to a lot of

185
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,720
developers but it couldn't really treat

186
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,680
on tree truth with the respect that it

187
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,120
so a lot of formulas in lumber is time

188
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,240
but your install require you to do

189
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,470
pseudo to start the service for the

190
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,060
program that its installed

191
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,990
so in this case the NS master needs to

192
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,150
bind a lower number port so it needs to

193
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,750
monitor a normally you don't run over on

194
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,180
the pseudo we do each it meets a elevate

195
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,060
during its installation but not really

196
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,820
even if you if you run through as we

197
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,620
it'll warn me like hey don't do this

198
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,690
but sometimes it needs to be better so

199
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,920
in this case we can solve the announced

200
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,060
mask and conserve the service and it's

201
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,110
running and that's great but if we look

202
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,290
here that um that DNS mask file is owned

203
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,610
by my user and not by reach now Humber

204
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,970
have attempted to solve for this problem

205
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,310
by making DNS mess not writable so if we

206
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,150
look at the Doudna

207
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,690
file we only have read and execute

208
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,920
permissions on it and not on right so

209
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,470
like that's an attempt and you can't

210
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,450
break through that file without changing

211
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,140
anything but we still own the directory

212
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,480
we can still change that file so

213
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,120
in this example I just wanted to use

214
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,540
that too I made a simple script and

215
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,910
simple gmail script that we just create

216
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,860
a file in blackberry which all new group

217
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,700
and thank you so we can't change the

218
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,550
file but we can repaint it and so I

219
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,820
renamed it and move my Eagle executable

220
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,529
into the same place this is all just

221
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,230
running it's my user and then the next

222
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,050
time you reboot harden goal script cool

223
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,480
one so on I reported this to hungry a

224
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,269
few weeks ago and it's been fixed since

225
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:42,279
then for homebrew services and now it's

226
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,410
now whenever you start their service

227
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:52,070
they it's through homebrew it's it's

228
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,510
owned by group and that's take you like

229
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,720
it set so long with users cannot change

230
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,930
or modify them but like what else is

231
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,350
vulnerable this kind of attack there's a

232
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,160
lot of things now I can't say what is

233
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,269
vulnerable to this first lock is I don't

234
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:13,010
know everything that's vulnerable this

235
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,500
there's so many things but also this is

236
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:22,160
the number what is this 9 9 to 8 popular

237
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,860
applications including Mac management

238
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:31,130
tools like enterprise communication

239
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:37,850
tools even some Mac security tools are

240
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,529
vulnerable to these types of attacks

241
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:44,180
because they don't they don't place the

242
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,190
right permissions long sure they're on

243
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,750
to the i-x peoples that they whether

244
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,699
through launch humans directly or

245
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:55,190
through processes like things that we

246
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,670
can't handle it but I'll ship so I can't

247
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,920
tell you everything that is one of those

248
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,959
it's the first I don't know but also a

249
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,180
lot of them have been fixed in I've

250
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,940
reported to a lot of vendors about this

251
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,300
some are taking months to fix it

252
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,090
others dispute that this is actually

253
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,890
problem and other things are only happen

254
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,510
when you have combinations of different

255
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,760
software so I just wanted to show demo

256
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:39,970
of what this looks like I put my demo so

257
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:52,360
I've got a VM what we're here this is

258
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,930
the hard part so I've gotta be in here

259
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,690
and I developed this cilium work that I

260
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,600
called root canal and I already

261
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,610
downloaded it here and you can see that

262
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,480
I have a motorized because I don't know

263
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,460
what no ization actually checks for but

264
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,200
I wasn't able to get it to reject

265
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:27,490
anything I wrote so here's here's a nice

266
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,320
little application I spent about five

267
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,850
minutes in interface builder you can

268
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,980
like blender up all these things

269
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,000
whatever those buttons you can play mmm

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,990
but when you click this button here you

271
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,300
end up with this like objective by the

272
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,580
seat root CA trusted in your system

273
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,070
teacher and like what actually happens

274
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,900
when I click that button

275
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,640
so it's scanning the filesystem for

276
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,760
launch demon name well loads on watch

277
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,990
demons in the memory to figure out what

278
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,500
they want

279
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,290
it's and all ex pupils that those run

280
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,480
and it will prioritize anything that has

281
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,300
a watch path that can be written to so

282
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,860
watch path so probably my favorite

283
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,650
feature to launch these is you can make

284
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,250
things one just right now on them so if

285
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,110
it finds one that has a watch path

286
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,149
I can touch it will touch that and run

287
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:35,440
immediately now if there are times there

288
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,089
aren't any of watch paths they will

289
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:41,019
still do you will still do this but you

290
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,550
have to wait for the service do you want

291
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,339
whether that's to reboot I'm probably

292
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:47,649
thankfully found one that you so much

293
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,870
path we've done this MOA faster because

294
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,490
we're eating angry and more fix right

295
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,200
but that's really it I did give it a

296
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,550
nice feature where you can click it

297
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,680
again it will remove the route but

298
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,660
there's and I don't know why and key can

299
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:10,029
access it we will live show it in there

300
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:13,420
but when it disappears you have to

301
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,209
relive the half of it so that's that's

302
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,550
like the example never get it right and

303
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,350
I can obviously have it be way more than

304
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:30,100
that but I didn't want to like check the

305
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:39,570
lock micromachine back

306
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,850
so that's the demo of this like it

307
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,500
really stands for everything that I

308
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,540
can't tell you what is installed in that

309
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,000
VM there's a lot of third-party software

310
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,750
installed on that we an they're very

311
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,480
easily at these way but really this is

312
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,720
like about your descriptions and you

313
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,220
know Apple remove this repair disk

314
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,730
permissions thing but you've got to

315
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,260
repair your dis permissions if you're

316
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,959
going to use a third-party software

317
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,680
applications have their creditors

318
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,359
connections and it's not just

319
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:34,150
drag-and-drop applications or like

320
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,450
homebrew services applications that

321
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,120
install through packages can be very

322
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,710
vulnerable to this kind of thing as well

323
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,660
whether that's because in the ROM they

324
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,020
specify things being owned by the center

325
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,770
everybody is in instead of real or they

326
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,520
have crazy person install scripts that

327
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,310
change everything that got installed in

328
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,440
the right way so what I would strongly

329
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,790
recommend is if you're gonna install

330
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,820
things from packages but have any post

331
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,890
install scripts install it on another

332
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,110
machine and then analyze what it

333
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,460
actually ended up that's because I've

334
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,210
seen installers that like hundreds of

335
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,590
post install script and you don't really

336
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,890
know particular but how can we tell what

337
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,660
it's actually horribleness and how did I

338
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,900
find it and how do I find out things for

339
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,960
me so I they're going to be leaves it to

340
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,880
focus query which is originated at

341
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,670
Facebook and it's a great way to look at

342
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:43,110
what's actually on your system and and

343
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,050
like okay

344
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,190
because it's equal interface you can

345
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,380
join against different tables and look

346
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,850
at different conditions of different

347
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,800
things so I like to write somewhat

348
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,220
complex sequel queries on that we use in

349
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,170
history and don't worry I'll share these

350
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,620
out later on but what this one does

351
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,610
so all the launch demons in your system

352
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,960
[Music]

353
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,880
although this one looks for requests is

354
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,919
there scrambled so this look this looks

355
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:16,590
like all the processes that are running

356
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,460
every and all the and the files that are

357
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,190
backing them and whether or not they're

358
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,400
actually owned by we or owned by we're

359
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,860
like can they be written by the elected

360
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,659
and the mining we owned by regional but

361
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:33,940
they might be writable by finally use it

362
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,669
so this helps us find vulnerable on

363
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:42,429
applications and executables and it's

364
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:43,539
not just the things that are directly

365
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,820
referenced by launch demons but it's

366
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:51,309
things that they may invoke now the one

367
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:52,899
of the hard things about demons is that

368
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,580
it's very hard to tell it's actually

369
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,000
executed so this is this is a example of

370
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,380
watching them from okay it's not

371
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,029
vulnerable to this type of attack look

372
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:05,020
could be if someone like schmatta these

373
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,940
are local for curses if you like seven

374
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,289
seconds seven that would obviously be

375
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:11,590
vulnerable but here we have user local

376
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,929
monkey supervisor look it's easy to tell

377
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:16,480
it that thing that stupid but later you

378
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,279
have a parameter of this manage software

379
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:23,140
update executable but it's like it's

380
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,580
just a string and you don't really know

381
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,610
like when you're looking at thousands of

382
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,529
our students like what's actually been

383
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,090
executed so that's why it's really

384
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,010
important to look at the actual

385
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,230
processes it's not exploited well this

386
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,179
is the same exact query I need that I

387
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:42,899
will share out the good directories but

388
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:45,580
the point here is that oh scream it's

389
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,559
really easy to find three sections or

390
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:51,789
abilities and when you look at the

391
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:55,299
launch demon ones and processes to you

392
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:59,200
on this is a sizable story so here's an

393
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,610
example of something that would get

394
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,919
returned from postcards from Carbon Copy

395
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,649
corner and we can see that this

396
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:08,620
ex-people is owned by my user and same

397
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,440
run by root I mean I attempted to

398
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,570
replace X cables here but it's not

399
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,890
actually vulnerable to this type of

400
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,720
attack because Carbon Copy corner

401
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,800
um verifies the pets cables that it's

402
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,520
going to execute as before action once

403
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,470
them so just because something gets

404
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,510
returned on some of these queries

405
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,610
doesn't mean that back you can level so

406
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,880
how do you minimize us your companies or

407
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,630
your direct exposure the same thing as

408
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,600
well as if your developers I'm obviously

409
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,450
evaluate as David thanks after your keep

410
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,860
usually local they might have you path

411
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,410
like it's really um it's really popular

412
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,810
to you know you sound brewing

413
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,360
I think Humber effectively on so it's

414
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,370
path these days but it's easy to swamp I

415
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,160
use anything um if you're developer and

416
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,130
you want your program to end up in in

417
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,920
users hats so they can easily limit use

418
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,820
this feature

419
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,610
Dracula's flexi fast lucky you can

420
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,980
create a file in this folder and it will

421
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,520
hand out and the contents of that bottle

422
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,950
end up in users paths without you having

423
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,230
could dump your executables maybe use

424
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,160
your local bin or somewhere else tools

425
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,560
like monkeying puppet use this and it

426
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,250
works out pretty well if you're if you

427
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,390
have management tools that that call out

428
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,480
on their excuse mother that's like that

429
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,580
you're using factor with puppet or you

430
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,800
use it like extension attributes in camp

431
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,680
or whatever you're doing useful paths to

432
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,690
executables the ones that ship on the

433
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,070
system instead of just saying for all or

434
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,460
we like user control on use the things

435
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,920
and apple chips that Apple gives you so

436
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,330
you're less susceptible to having

437
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,790
something on you and follow up with I

438
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,160
was Prairie on you can use classes

439
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,800
events even to know kind of works

440
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,860
following the tips but the real winning

441
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,810
move here is just assume that any non

442
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,350
sandbox process for the one

443
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:34,600
on a real on as much as you can do to

444
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,809
guard against this kind of thing without

445
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,899
doing crazy full static analysis of

446
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:43,330
everything that's been relying on the

447
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,720
computer it's it's harder than that is

448
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,100
something like we conditionally executed

449
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,629
or something like that so yeah there's

450
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:57,970
just seeing that and like what could

451
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,169
Apple and you to help us with this um

452
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:04,059
the things that we found most common

453
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:08,350
were directly volatile processes to

454
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,129
watch II so it would be great if watch

455
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:16,509
II wouldn't execute directly programs

456
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:22,240
that don't have safe permissions I don't

457
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,610
think this will change because it's been

458
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,450
the behavior forever but it would be or

459
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:33,100
go along way to change this if there was

460
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,200
a method that walk all mount say about

461
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,830
so down the Mac it would be great to

462
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,570
guard against a second malware even

463
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,889
after your installations were still

464
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:44,350
there but I think what's really gonna

465
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,779
happen is that routes abilities are

466
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,429
going to be reduced even more over time

467
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:51,159
on so that we even lost interest in

468
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:56,259
during the backers and with that does

469
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:57,759
anybody have any questions and I will

470
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,690
tweet out the queries to for the North

471
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,220
Korea that's the homework that I want

472
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,990
everyone to have is let go of all these

473
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,519
queries and see what's all about your

474
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,700
system because I'm betting that at least

475
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,970
half the vaccinations are vulnerable to

476
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,200
these types of attacks

477
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,350
questions I have a question um you could

478
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,840
be a good idea for an hour author or two

479
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,809
perhaps once they get on a system run

480
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,509
this query and then dynamically

481
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:34,019
basically find yes so that's just yes so

482
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:38,240
that's exactly what my sample does um

483
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,919
when I was first writing it I was like I

484
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,039
just had five quoted paths but yeah then

485
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,990
I was like well why don't I just seen

486
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,759
everything wasn't that all right I wrote

487
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,620
it in Swift there's my first Swift app

488
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,870
so it's super fast but if if you're

489
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,269
malware wants route and you can do this

490
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:58,919
then you should do it

491
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,480
well you shouldn't right now look like

492
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,159
one if you're going to and your malware

493
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,929
needs route like just to make it easier

494
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:08,899
for your users instead of asking them

495
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:12,419
talk about like if you can't find

496
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:13,980
anything vulnerable then it's still pop

497
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,169
it up like yeah

498
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:18,990
and we also surprised by the fact that

499
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,659
Kazak busy if we literally um yes like

500
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,909
so really all it does so the app it's as

501
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:34,220
simple so if that it has the program um

502
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,259
but actually does the militia so sure as

503
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:40,080
a string and then it just works without

504
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,200
the file system yeah and I mean I don't

505
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,389
know what the authorization does at this

506
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:48,419
point but I submitted it maybe Apple

507
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,899
will make it so that this one thing it's

508
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:54,090
rejected in the feature but hope that

509
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,139
leg yet yes I think like apps looking at

510
00:26:58,139 --> 00:26:59,759
your file system like that's a little

511
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,679
big enough thing to do have some idea

512
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,909
things to the file system that's

513
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:03,450
legitimate

514
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,700
so it's hard it I think it would be hard

515
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,929
to vote that they contain numbers

516
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:11,519
automatically but it's certainly

517
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,340
something that I would expect should not

518
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,959
be notarized in the future
