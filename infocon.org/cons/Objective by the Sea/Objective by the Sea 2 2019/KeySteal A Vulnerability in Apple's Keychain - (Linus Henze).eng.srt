00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,609
[Music]

2
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:13,280
image photo of

3
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,860
looks like and yeah as I stats you put

4
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,930
all your personal password across the

5
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,540
keys everything you want to be encrypted

6
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,150
out of the news because being able to

7
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,070
access them in keychain and it's

8
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,170
encrypted by using you know login

9
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,020
password so it means when you log in

10
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:53,230
yeah automatically be decrypted and yeah

11
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,900
what uses the keychain basically quite a

12
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,400
lot of APIs officers

13
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,610
I can't and I can use the in keychain

14
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,350
and also have a few apps like swag

15
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,970
together yeah anymore and use logging in

16
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,220
to take up hot spots using the same

17
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:21,070
system keychain system features yeah

18
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:27,950
because it's thoughts mainly yeah it's

19
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,010
more interesting when you are you know

20
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:38,269
in your company wish to apply absolute

21
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,709
make sure that yeah it's any credit than

22
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,680
their network and it's also encrypted

23
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,810
but of course cannot be encrypted using

24
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,970
user passbook we can also edit that

25
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,310
casually need to encrypt the encryption

26
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,610
key with a user password and the just

27
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,799
can't do that because business started

28
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:58,610
our system

29
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,430
he's only readable by road and you can

30
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,560
know menu that you can check what's

31
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,470
inside us and also some content box you

32
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:16,700
be able to see all right some that

33
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,228
Marcus and this one just about a

34
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,060
keychain

35
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,760
well the keychain usually as someone's

36
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,030
they are

37
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,470
and yeah you can also use it to share

38
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,440
credentials with perhaps problems of

39
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,180
others of course it's a single

40
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,070
population if you lose you're in a sport

41
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:45,500
safe yeah you just won't be able to get

42
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,380
your passwords again and second doesn't

43
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,680
watch it trust yourself as a keychain is

44
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,010
very large because I decided to create

45
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,650
one process that handles the kitchen and

46
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,450
thousands of other things basically this

47
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:12,200
process access any keychain and I just

48
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:19,300
show quick example of that first of all

49
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,120
this that's basically everything inside

50
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,240
each man's kitchen hunt and there are

51
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,669
multiple classes five homes in have

52
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,010
passports key certificates like that and

53
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,490
you know each item has attributes and

54
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:43,370
attribute usernames whatever you want

55
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,540
and also if you use the keychain and

56
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,290
know about secure notes and I have to

57
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,120
tell you that secure notes are not a

58
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,790
class but they are just a generic

59
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,810
password and yeah the keychain access

60
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,200
program I just set one of the attributes

61
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,990
to secure notes of knows it's not a

62
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,540
normal password policy you know well

63
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,640
small example or you can't access the

64
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,789
keychain

65
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,210
focus on this it's actually pretty

66
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,959
[Music]

67
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,480
and now you want to tell us system if

68
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,930
you want to get your attributes items or

69
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,030
if you want to get the actual data which

70
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,830
is encrypted and if you get the actual

71
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,380
date like that there might be from the

72
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,699
user to all of it yeah additionally you

73
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,220
can just put other attributes in there

74
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,290
because pictionary to a function

75
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:21,150
2008 Ranieri each various back then

76
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,490
that's keychain internals how the

77
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,450
keychain box magazines basically

78
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,620
responsible for the keychain passing

79
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,440
encryption keys and it's doing the

80
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:48,840
access control and yeah there were

81
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,859
forgot here with your framework

82
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,880
implements of executed random and you

83
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,099
know that's also a low-level

84
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,110
there's Nick the interface generator and

85
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,840
basically you can use mink for remote

86
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,550
procedure corner and those I know like

87
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,860
nice then used lower-level actually nice

88
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,400
to do to actually communicate with

89
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,500
security new interesting part is Alice's

90
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,990
communication work and communication my

91
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,010
thoughts and also for those of you who

92
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,470
know they're just message queues and

93
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,500
they work

94
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,380
it means you've got one process that

95
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,620
basically owns the amount parent was

96
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,690
able to read messages from spot and many

97
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,330
processes that so a lot to send to the

98
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,560
support yeah he covers these processes

99
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,420
alters hemorrhage and newborn also has a

100
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,300
name and game basically and it's not

101
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,170
unique on a system so I like normal

102
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:25,210
tcp/ip port and yeah these names are

103
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,760
just unique for each process that means

104
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,510
I've got two processors AMD and process

105
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,690
am may have four one two three four five

106
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,460
and process B may have at 1:57 and it

107
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,560
could still read next to the same port

108
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,910
internally and what's also important

109
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,670
about this process when I create a new

110
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,580
part then other processes won't know

111
00:09:51,580 --> 00:10:01,560
about it it's also a special kind of

112
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,000
transport and yeah each process has one

113
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,990
of its power and allows you to modify

114
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,010
the process

115
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,090
reading writing creating new painless

116
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,750
solutions whatever I want and you can

117
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:30,400
also use it to process because once your

118
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:42,480
process is of course you need to send

119
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,640
and is meta messages are just structured

120
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,170
data are embodied and dakara contains

121
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,649
basic information like all

122
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:01,149
a message to before the replant Martin

123
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:04,689
they are to basically tell recipient

124
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:08,350
alone we are to send reply to and of

125
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:14,439
course message ID in this recipient

126
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:19,420
knows what kind of messages and then

127
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,110
there's also funny this is basically the

128
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,800
body has two parts one part of my column

129
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,629
and this column process part may contain

130
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:39,189
other parts and process also contains

131
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:48,509
memory buffers whatever you want and

132
00:11:48,509 --> 00:12:09,850
yeah you can just use message to each

133
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,620
ways as a great example

134
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:23,350
well you will be Twitter and you would

135
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:30,220
like to and I'd like to find out my

136
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,620
password because I've used a function

137
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,470
then you would need to send the message

138
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,100
like this and what you put in this

139
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,350
message is correct

140
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:49,749
of course mr. J's username mind username

141
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:57,850
and you open Sanders to security and

142
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,029
some wild take out of my storage

143
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,740
processor and down

144
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,880
with the effects super secure as work

145
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,870
and what you need to know is if you look

146
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,000
at both messages you will see that's the

147
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,350
reflect what's different

148
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,210
the reason for this was because upset

149
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,360
all things the most unique the process

150
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:38,500
so usually has number-17 sounds the

151
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:58,090
mascot will give I told you that's a new

152
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,110
credit our processes don't know it also

153
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,290
means it can just send a message to do

154
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,490
this because he sews because we don't

155
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:16,590
know for and because II to find out it

156
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,660
was launched the process on the bus and

157
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,670
this process basically has applauded

158
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,290
stats and whenever a new process when

159
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,620
you spawn a new process the process will

160
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,660
inherit your instructors usually in

161
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:50,140
support and yes you can use this boost

162
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,720
reports because every service needs to

163
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,530
check in with the county as a message to

164
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,930
the schools before and then just

165
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:09,449
basically since is receiving such as on

166
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,160
just the clusters ruining the case of

167
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,430
Twitter for example first eats you Sam

168
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,220
Osteen message that's we're looking for

169
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,170
security so ologist security and

170
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,360
Blackbaud again and sent this message

171
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:44,340
and contain ox e yeah back to us we can

172
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:50,330
use this for you to the communication

173
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,860
now about keygen and access control of

174
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,030
course I need to be some access

175
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,180
controller simply don't want arbitrary

176
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,520
process us to just get all the passwords

177
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,310
and because of this there's an access

178
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,970
control is associated with each keychain

179
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,630
item and basically interested with

180
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,090
protections that are allowed to access

181
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:22,890
the item yeah of course our turret

182
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,250
processes cannot edit this I see no only

183
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,590
the users allowed to do so or occasions

184
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,100
already in this list our question is how

185
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,150
is it enforced and it's actually pretty

186
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,000
simple before what you want to do

187
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,260
anything in security the doctor and Amy

188
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,110
with rest of each and the first did you

189
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,200
create a set and when creating a session

190
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,130
you send your special tasks for security

191
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:59,130
evil then used to signature and yeah

192
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,890
that's it cool in mind if you were

193
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:08,430
allowed to access what you do is first

194
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,280
of all what needs to send a created

195
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,720
session request and need to put in there

196
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,510
and also yeah can we talk they were like

197
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,369
all automated because later

198
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,319
and we are doing additional requests

199
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,449
don't want a separate task force on each

200
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:32,559
time and because of this we just and we

201
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,039
only include our tripod in a massage and

202
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,220
security dealer them look groups list

203
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,610
all sessions and find our time work and

204
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:54,940
there's a whole way to and yeah you do

205
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,830
miss a message and security evil session

206
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:14,200
and send came back the access parts know

207
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
it's time to actually exploit the

208
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:25,140
keychain and tell you oh and you know I

209
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,330
needed the Sun forces came because you

210
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:35,370
know greatest explorers and I

211
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,620
just thought that having samples camp

212
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,270
would be cool and I looked into samples

213
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,610
profile of continent which is the

214
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,539
process data JavaScript and yeah it's

215
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:51,700
allowed to access common Apple security

216
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,659
so the service and just because of the

217
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:58,179
name because it contains security just

218
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,070
thought I have to look into that and

219
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:10,830
yeah didn't find a sample scared box and

220
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,779
whatever it was I hope through the

221
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,289
documentation and this article about

222
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:21,820
hosting Gaston and I never heard of this

223
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,840
feature and I guess none of you but

224
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,490
about people and basically these

225
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,450
features and clone plans

226
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,120
security and allows you to tell the

227
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,920
system that you are now launching a

228
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,500
plugin and whenever you are now doing a

229
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:47,480
chain requests with all system okay yeah

230
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,140
problem is still doesn't work so I used

231
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,360
to fix up and also has the ability it's

232
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,580
only ethics and vulnerability is

233
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,000
basically this function it's causing

234
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,490
posts and hosting part what does this

235
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,400
function do basically we've got two

236
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,140
modes to a neighbor

237
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,260
this gets code hosting feature it's a

238
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,690
proxy mode which is the easier mode you

239
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,880
just tell us system ok I'm launching a

240
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:32,720
given and telephone for you and there's

241
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,270
also this dynamic mode can be enabled

242
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,690
using this function and you need to have

243
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,440
a Mac part two you know then we use by

244
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,770
security and kitchen requests or code

245
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:53,870
the controller data then security D will

246
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,720
send message to the popular out of 12

247
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,970
and you don't have to send a reply back

248
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,930
what's the problem is function well no

249
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:12,950
factors now this is not that's not know

250
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,490
back in there it's just checking if

251
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,690
you're already in dynamic mode and

252
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,660
refuses to set up there is a cure what

253
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,300
is most part you cannot be in no more

254
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:32,780
than in your sections and looks correct

255
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,440
is correct

256
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,620
the Barkers here there's always a fun

257
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,080
our country and thus will be involved

258
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,030
when your session is

259
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,050
and the session really because it causes

260
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:53,000
accidents and basically Daskal subjects

261
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,310
in which mode you are and if you are in

262
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,180
dynamic mode then it does cause destroy

263
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,630
on the pottery past what a problem of

264
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,590
that it's calling market are destroyed

265
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:13,280
on the product past and what does means

266
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,920
is you can just send a random part to

267
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,750
security and when you say the part

268
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,910
already knows about and it would not get

269
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,890
an additional part but it just will get

270
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,240
a new reference on the problem is that

271
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,360
when you use markup or destroy and the

272
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,010
reference count will be set to zero

273
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,280
and what they should have done is they

274
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,010
should have used my dear okay which will

275
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,730
just drop the additional reference god

276
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,200
and yeah when all these references get

277
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,860
destroyed then you basically have a use

278
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,100
of freedom they're not there with memory

279
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,570
but my boss and you just have some part

280
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,920
of security even and this also exists

281
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:12,200
and which my to use it you can also them

282
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,500
replace this porn yeah of course we can

283
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,860
not read out important security but what

284
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,960
can we do with that we just need to go

285
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,580
back to security sessions and I told you

286
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,260
that to create a session universe and

287
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,970
hospital and when you send a task for

288
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,510
this session will be tied to a sport and

289
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,600
what you can do now is you can process

290
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,990
which just create a session and then use

291
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,040
it back to free passport and know I've

292
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,260
got a session that just has a daily top

293
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,299
part

294
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:58,619
and you can not access it anymore

295
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:04,059
and doesn't sound really useful actually

296
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:04,659
yes

297
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:11,830
and if I tell you what can be used for

298
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,359
just a small party or just interested in

299
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,929
this part this is the monthly visits or

300
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:22,200
when you're creating a new session and

301
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,960
the ending part is this one what it does

302
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,389
is it checks at the taskbar that sounds

303
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:30,940
is already tied to a session and if

304
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,039
that's the case and you asked to create

305
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,859
a new session it will think you've got

306
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:39,570
amnesia and will reset your session and

307
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,389
you know it's not in your session it's

308
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:46,450
not really hard and this part is

309
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,220
interesting because this yeah find

310
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,929
identification setup function just

311
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:57,249
reloads the kills the contrail from a

312
00:24:57,249 --> 00:25:01,960
process but it's using a process ID and

313
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,840
it has saved and the process ID is saved

314
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,220
the first time you create a session so

315
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,919
it is not taking the process ID of the

316
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,599
process that actually made the request

317
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,369
to reinitialize the session but it's

318
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:21,369
taking a safe process edgy and yeah what

319
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:27,669
can we use this for basically being a

320
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:30,340
session and then somehow really revise

321
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,639
it and make sure that the process ID

322
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:36,099
memo or process that originally created

323
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:40,210
the session as now yeah that I need of

324
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,009
another process that has a special

325
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:45,639
entitlement or private security and only

326
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:49,389
creation then will be able to secure

327
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:52,690
chain without any password promise

328
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,799
because this function that checks

329
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:02,200
yourself and has this and it checks the

330
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,770
process signed by Apple and it has this

331
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,670
right entitlement and yeah basically

332
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,980
humans are cares it's true

333
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,790
and also this comment is from Apple for

334
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:16,940
me

335
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,490
so they already tell you pass this

336
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,580
checked and you often forgive it and

337
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,210
there will be no problem just need to

338
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,980
finds a process that passes in high

339
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,480
demands we can use your techmount

340
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:41,800
database and we just choose like

341
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,750
concentrator and do all these these

342
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,210
things will be able to access the

343
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,410
content without a passport

344
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,190
it's just one last problem understand

345
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,090
and Great Recession we don't have access

346
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,990
to it anymore

347
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:08,030
and what we need to do this we somehow

348
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,230
need to replace this task or obsession

349
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,560
and we can do that by sending a neutral

350
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,370
thoughts eventually one of them will get

351
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,290
the same moment as well as what had

352
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,200
become comma just has a list of youth

353
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,300
sports and it just likes to be used for

354
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:43,610
names all right and this security D and

355
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,460
so how he stood process and the first

356
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,680
thing we need is a hub process okay now

357
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,980
we need this type of process to create a

358
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,310
special security D first and to do that

359
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,490
needs a task board and just ask a common

360
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,190
for and it needs to create a new

361
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,940
connection port that we'll use for

362
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,500
security Houston good class and what we

363
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,460
do is we just send a message without ask

364
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,120
for an action for and so yeah

365
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,950
I would not put the cotton on the stay

366
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,000
of the cost and I'm not really

367
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,010
interesting and what security analysis

368
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,760
creates the session for discussion and

369
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,610
it pulls your passport in them and

370
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,930
creates a new session where this

371
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:42,850
connection part will be put it but okay

372
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,910
and you know what to do this freest as

373
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:52,490
well and to do this we need yeah again

374
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,520
review process it also has a task force

375
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,440
and connection port and what we do now

376
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,090
is we stand test port of the whole

377
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:07,880
process to our trade process which is

378
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:16,850
Sam just ask for process and job now I

379
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,980
can do the actual free and how do we do

380
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,250
that

381
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:33,470
yeah we need to first okay and we get in

382
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,770
replying look what we need to do now is

383
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:45,290
we use hosting action and we send a

384
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,560
message with a hosting part and this

385
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:57,020
book has process and passport will be

386
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,560
political session is hosting good and

387
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,410
now we can just left the trigger process

388
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,750
actually

389
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:14,750
so axles and China and the corner will

390
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,770
stand security didn't touch the present

391
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,560
instance okay this has bought in there

392
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,030
are just dies and yeah doesn't exist

393
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,280
anymore and what security view will do

394
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,180
this butchers Alito specialty

395
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:37,880
now help us diello caved on trigger

396
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,410
process measurable what will be going on

397
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:48,530
and now this Accord smart or destroy on

398
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,650
the hosting talk because the hosting

399
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,700
name as the taskbar first session it

400
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,370
will also die now because it's removing

401
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,320
all references setting the reference

402
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,570
camera of this task four to zero so

403
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:13,400
we'll be gonna process this and I'll

404
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,520
cast port just don't exist anymore

405
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,310
there's now session that has tied to a

406
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,980
non existing task board and the session

407
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,540
will never die because security will

408
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,250
never know that yes

409
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,680
associated tasks for tonight because it

410
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,500
has no associated Pasquale so even if

411
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,140
our hello would die now then the color

412
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,880
would also send a message for security

413
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,880
telling it that the process diet parts

414
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,040
the transport will just get a new number

415
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,580
and goes to the list villages don't find

416
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,230
the transport and list of sessions we

417
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,870
need to do now is we need to regain

418
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:00,920
access to our session and so yeah we do

419
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,060
that by setting new travel for security

420
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,480
we first of all we should create a new

421
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,310
session because we don't have one at

422
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,140
least security it doesn't know that we

423
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,440
have one we just as its message again we

424
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,690
ready midnight report and those sessions

425
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,740
can see them that even though the task

426
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,050
part of the first session should be

427
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,870
equal to the second session doesn't the

428
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,510
case because the colleges assignment in

429
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:42,620
new normal if you apply and now you can

430
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,769
just thank you fought through security

431
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:52,139
and to do that we need task 1 and 1/3

432
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:55,139
connection part need quite a lot of

433
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:59,730
posture and what we do now is a security

434
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,529
message that we would like to add a

435
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:05,600
connection to one of our sessions in the

436
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,559
second session and this new connection

437
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,139
of what we proposed in the West and tell

438
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:20,090
us at work and now we can just ask

439
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,850
security to create another connection

440
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,850
but this time use our third connection

441
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,230
as a task pod and use a test port yeah

442
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,720
just to test it thanks for in this case

443
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,399
look at a reply that doesn't know

444
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,000
passport because if you look there our

445
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,169
connection port just isn't a technology

446
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:49,019
but we do this deletes the connection

447
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:53,669
bar and when we do this a few thousand

448
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:58,440
times takes two seconds of me then yeah

449
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,970
when we do this step of salmon the third

450
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:08,790
connection session then the third

451
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,770
connection port will get the same number

452
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:16,079
as the task port and as you can see this

453
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,819
part this one the same cost promise I

454
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:21,780
don't understand nama

455
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,699
and so you get a reply and probably you

456
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,679
first need to find out if things worked

457
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,909
and we do this step again and this time

458
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:37,139
our test port will be registered first

459
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,629
session because security we know things

460
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:41,760
that of the connection port is about a

461
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,300
task board and we gather with fly back

462
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,409
to that work and you know and how we

463
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:52,730
know that Scott succeeded

464
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,550
yeah we need to do now us we need to

465
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,520
send us that connection at the same time

466
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:07,910
part to our main key spirit process and

467
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,890
to send receive right it is that simple

468
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:16,140
our process will soon die and we need to

469
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:30,300
make sure that as well as I have a

470
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,610
process mom - exactly the internet

471
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:37,620
concentrator and and I've just written

472
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,110
the process ID numbers to the session

473
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,820
and the hell process and right now the

474
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:53,550
process is we do an expect not and first

475
00:35:53,550 --> 00:36:02,750
of all the ice in this process and

476
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,970
internet a contractor will be there and

477
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,910
it will have exactly the same process ID

478
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:16,500
because we used exact before and I just

479
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,050
additionally and I will rename this

480
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:26,820
connection port I can do now us use

481
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,600
affect us or to reinitialize the session

482
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,670
and it just do that by asking security

483
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,280
key to create a new session and security

484
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,610
he will see that you know the session

485
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,580
already exists and will reinitialize it

486
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,090
and will visualizing the session it will

487
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:49,500
use the same safe versus ID to get the

488
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,000
entitlements and protocol true yeah of

489
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,300
banks and it will get the code signature

490
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,430
entitlements from you know cosmic radio

491
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,920
because this is the one that housed the

492
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,930
process ID one week wait so so now

493
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,260
our connection with purchase ecology of

494
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,680
discussion and security the things that

495
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,350
the secessionist own my ideas have a

496
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,620
concentrate on and we get a reply back

497
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:25,200
that work and now we basically won

498
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,640
because we can use the session or to

499
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,630
just ask a security to give us whatever

500
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,420
passport we want and there won't be a

501
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,240
passport from because the planes will in

502
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,860
the net concentrator which is allowed to

503
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:48,200
access the keychain so yeah one month

504
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,140
before the short demo I just show you

505
00:37:52,140 --> 00:38:01,410
how you they tell you that they fix the

506
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,140
music leadership with improve memory

507
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,110
management I really like to see that

508
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,370
improvement with memory management

509
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,330
because there I didn't talk about memory

510
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:17,600
at all so it's not a memory back but ok

511
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:24,660
ok and what they did this or that's

512
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,010
rather saying what I think they did this

513
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:39,030
because so I didn't do that and it looks

514
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,220
like they replaced this microphone is

515
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:47,100
prior to the ok correct so you won't be

516
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,870
able to read apart and it also looks

517
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,260
like and they change this setup function

518
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,710
so when you now reinitialize the session

519
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,860
yeah it will not only use the process I

520
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,720
need that it's safe but it will also we

521
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,820
use the generation and the generation

522
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,580
number is just a 32-bit number that is

523
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,090
incremented each time you do a fork on

524
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,180
exact and yeah

525
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,410
would need to expect four billion times

526
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,250
to be able to pull out this attack again

527
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:30,470
the Q and a buck like I did so even if

528
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,819
you could find a back to free important

529
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:38,740
you just cook it sports anymore

530
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,689
all right now demonstration

531
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,570
this too

532
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:26,530
and now I run my key steel demon because

533
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,030
I decided to make this he monster

534
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:36,210
processors can just request session and

535
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:40,770
takes a few seconds exploit succeeds and

536
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:49,470
now we can use but you can do now is I

537
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,120
guess there's a program called acuity

538
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,120
you know it can use to dump the keychain

539
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,020
but usually that which was a path of

540
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,430
product up here but I injected a small

541
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:08,140
library in this security program and a

542
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,630
request to the keychain these requests

543
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,450
will do my site to include effect a spot

544
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,680
and what happens is that will just run

545
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,830
and

546
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,500
shown you all the information and as you

547
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,690
saw there was no problems nothing and I

548
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:34,060
can just move it on demo eyes from doing

549
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,350
there and yeah let's find the data there

550
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:43,330
and the bestest passport just look in

551
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,640
there again for teaching access to work

552
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,670
with keychain forms these of passports

553
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:55,410
of the same and also show you that

554
00:42:55,410 --> 00:43:14,640
I can read system keychain my watch and

555
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,010
my super secure possible and that's just

556
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,670
the change that possible to correct with

557
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:30,829
the to proxy because it's the system and

558
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,989
[Music]

559
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,440
[Music]

560
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,869
and Google soon fine gets bought online

561
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:05,160
good luck and next few days

562
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,099
[Applause]

563
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:37,130
there any questions I actually didn't

564
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:41,720
take me that long I already knew about

565
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,200
my book replacement attacks most apps

566
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,680
you know very easy for me and to be

567
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,300
honest finding this yes wasn't too hard

568
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,859
because I sometimes read about SEO

569
00:44:57,859 --> 00:45:01,040
hosting article and I noticed that it

570
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,869
doesn't work but I didn't look into that

571
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:12,220
and yeah I just bought week or weeks

572
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:23,000
maybe two weeks this is kind of

573
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,470
tangential I may have an idea but it was

574
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:28,010
kind of curious give an idea how the the

575
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:31,510
system key is generated per device key I

576
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:37,430
just know that yes and it's just

577
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,380
generated at random I think the first

578
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,710
time you

579
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,170
[Music]

580
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:03,829
and so the we can reinforce the test why

581
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:06,109
is that like a pole mobility in Norfolk

582
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:13,309
sale well I'm not really falling I'm

583
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:16,519
just using the fact that the condo has a

584
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:21,440
list of recently used pots and basically

585
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,740
whenever you send a process that you

586
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,250
thought as know about come over go

587
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,339
through this list contain multi athletes

588
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:36,980
and yes also a generation and based on

589
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,069
this generation number and the entry

590
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:44,529
itself or generator number and basically

591
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:48,519
if you get the same generation number

592
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:52,940
one entry then you will also get the

593
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,269
same
