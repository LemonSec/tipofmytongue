1
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:06,920
my name is Joshua most people know me as

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,570
prophets Anja been around Joburg seen

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,510
for quite a while so I basically taught

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,090
myself everything about hacking the

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,360
chief research each week or for the

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,400
green boys in an accident jailbreak so

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,219
this is really more of a story about

8
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,600
well my entire year of 2017 I was

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,700
working on this exploit I don't usually

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,890
have that long as an attention span but

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,450
this was actually really really fun to

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:54,770
track what got me started and this was

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,350
actually back when I was a child so I

14
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,170
had an old Macintosh before my one other

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,789
13 school also had one so we kind of

16
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:11,539
shared you know video games that I was

17
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,310
going to do mine one day ups there was

18
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,479
something called Apple remote access

19
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,639
basically allows you to dial into a

20
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:23,619
negative use phone and xstep this was

21
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:26,450
1997 course the internet was still

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,810
clearly very nuanced

23
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,090
so I didn't have it in it at this time

24
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,729
I did not even have I'm building

25
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,479
actually went to school and traded a han

26
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,259
Solo trading card in for my first 56k

27
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:47,149
modem chance to test this out at bowing

28
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,399
to his computer set it up when he using

29
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,779
the shower one morning and maybe it's

30
00:01:53,779 --> 00:02:00,259
not a little bit so before this there

31
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,630
was a couple of odd things I've noticed

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,249
when I was doing my research for example

33
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:10,209
this kernel extension you can see it is

34
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,709
has a copyright header at the top but

35
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,540
I'm not sure what their copyright in

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,550
here because there's nothing there

37
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,490
this entire criminal extinction every

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:28,320
single one of the file is empty so after

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,750
a while you can't get it think like this

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,410
is a common time so I basically pulled

41
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,920
every single Apple open source code

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,080
extracted them the lion counted every

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,200
single one sorted ascending order

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,060
I'm gonna check to see which ones were

45
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,100
empty and which projects having those

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,610
memory ranky file one of them was an old

47
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,130
friend of mine that BP antigen

48
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,970
originally discovered this file when I

49
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,400
was trying to look into it I couldn't

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,090
tell why is that dick throwing back in

51
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,510
that wasn't in the binary there is a key

52
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,830
it was called no sandbox looking into

53
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,770
what that he does they basically

54
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,060
redirected it around the sandbox

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,959
initialization I wonder why they didn't

56
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,630
want people to find that yeah it's

57
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,580
clearly lighting security through

58
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,620
obscurity of a lot of repeat offenders

59
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,560
we're showing up there UI user said a

60
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,890
lot of course the main one I wanted

61
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,500
we're interested in was the PDP one a

62
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:55,220
very old software I actually found the

63
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,980
source report on one of the Apple vinci

64
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,989
websites

65
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,209
unfortunately Apple removes a stuffit

66
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,420
expander support so I did not look at it

67
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,579
yeah so then I realized okay so the

68
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,829
entire VPN system is actually built on

69
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,940
this old legacy modems for the next

70
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,400
thing said both do similar things but

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,880
one just does it for sound waves either

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,530
one does it over right now so how do I

73
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,200
actually get in and by installing these

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,320
PPP configurations and EP and stuff to

75
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,080
actually test it there's one thing which

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,390
kind of bothered me always whenever you

77
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,320
go up to change your Wi-Fi password for

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,790
different networks or DBS they never ask

79
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,110
you for your root password

80
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,110
this stuff is held in very secure

81
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,270
locations something has to be running

82
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,170
this birthday the easiest method I can

83
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,710
was simply go up to your network

84
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,390
configuration files you can select one

85
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,570
export configuration and as it basically

86
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,530
exports a phoebus file containing all

87
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,300
the different settings for T that were

88
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,360
configuration you can actually modify

89
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,940
that and had some extra ones in there

90
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,080
which don't really document this was

91
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,290
mostly just for testing though so beyond

92
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,170
that we have two well the VPN stuff

93
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,620
Renza it's the user so suddenly they get

94
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,630
a little more cartridges so one sticking

95
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,150
around through there I discovered there

96
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,690
was still a UNIX optic in flash bar size

97
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,360
running so a peb company it was seven

98
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,660
seven seven breathable right what's it

99
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,190
for

100
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,360
so let's see

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,560
we done this is the basic header format

102
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,110
for the tactics going over the units I

103
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,720
see very simple protocol one thing that

104
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,360
caught my attention that first lap that

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,140
would be the bug as you see down or it

106
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,260
says block the very bottom each are any

107
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:47,150
data one we should not have a character

108
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,810
or an array of size one there yeah

109
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,730
entire structure is now going to be

110
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,500
opposite by seven days look inside the

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,350
code you see apple tries to fix this a

112
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,550
couple times they first make a macro

113
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,650
basically just subtract one from it

114
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,930
before parsing it they still did that

115
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,590
wrong put in the code we continually do

116
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:23,720
call back and then fix that yeah so

117
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,190
these are some of the commands you can

118
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,180
sing to it most of them well I wasn't

119
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,950
sure which one to focus on so I just

120
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,520
focus on them all basically very simple

121
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,040
fuzzy but it was really only one thing

122
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:50,210
that stood out to me but lots of other

123
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,450
options

124
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,050
more about millions but thinks this

125
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,790
exploit actually did require a building

126
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:10,240
to be set up as a network device most

127
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,780
people don't have modems able I have had

128
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,920
a hard time trying to acquire one myself

129
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,470
first

130
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,330
yeah Morgan's work extremely complicated

131
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,010
back then every single provider actually

132
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,900
have their own unique specific or they

133
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,600
still do today

134
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,669
these things are pretty Apple but Apple

135
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,039
needed a way to support all these people

136
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,049
fortunately you don't necessarily need a

137
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:46,540
modem in order to do this so on the

138
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,750
order max every single time you plugged

139
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,160
in a serial to USB adapter it would

140
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,950
automatically create a new serial line

141
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,660
they were configuration in there most of

142
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,550
the sewer line buildings or well since

143
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,280
they're modems are also sewer line it's

144
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,670
very easy to simply modify what second

145
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,640
is you turn in esterline device in

146
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,080
deliver later on when they release the

147
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,760
newer Mac of throws they actually well

148
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,870
it has USB C so you can't really tell

149
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,080
you that but serial line just legalized

150
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,830
to it fortunately every single adapter

151
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,490
the USB Sita a I found would

152
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,630
automatically create a server line

153
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,660
device for that effect so if you had

154
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,360
used USB we didn't even need to have a

155
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,050
moment so you know doesn't like the fuzz

156
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,410
whisker but this is the exploit for the

157
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,460
purpose escalation

158
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,110
even though I closed everything in here

159
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,830
continuously the stupidest bugs I found

160
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,850
was this one right there

161
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,160
the sin PPP connect apparently if you

162
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,740
run it from the socket it watches ppps

163
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:26,060
root they're not as music yeah so when I

164
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,550
suppose these are typically the error

165
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,620
codes that should have been started at

166
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,120
256 now this is the error results my

167
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:46,819
buzzer guy and here you can see actually

168
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:48,500
took me a while because I kept buzzing

169
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,480
it and not realizing what was happening

170
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,870
then I finally realized oh this actually

171
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:01,420
watching roots not user anymore still

172
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,009
nobody actually EP running is yeah we

173
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,920
either how do we actually gain oh that's

174
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:18,170
easy for next so back in 1997 Apple

175
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,660
released their I magically and it

176
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,209
included a built-in modem what are the

177
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:26,839
firstly lake specifically for innovation

178
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,970
by Mac in the next Mac and they included

179
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,620
different logo stuff the CCOs burgers

180
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,949
yeah Apple documented quite well on that

181
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:42,769
let's see so these scripts handle both

182
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,050
following up and answer any other

183
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:50,269
telephone so what's in a typical sea

184
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,630
snail bundle really just the folder

185
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,329
within info.plist and ACCC expert the

186
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:03,939
example of both this is mice info.plist

187
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:06,230
and you can probably start to get it

188
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,740
where I'm going on the next wave

189
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,120
simply adding a whole bunch of days and

190
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,990
couple little bites into there it

191
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,280
actually allows you to select specific

192
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,640
variables inside of the bundle including

193
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:35,800
the username password yeah APN oh yeah

194
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,560
and you said a couple variable ones

195
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,660
awesome so those variable strings look

196
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,000
kind of the first day of testing I spent

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,570
about two days working on something to

198
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,720
buzz or creates CCL scripts so I can

199
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,640
close it all and I thought you know

200
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,770
let's just try these variable string

201
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:06,040
things in their insensitive but well

202
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,420
that's that's right at the budget of

203
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,060
mittens and it turns out half of them

204
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:17,140
are open 13 which one of the strings are

205
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,450
actually passed out strings so it

206
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,530
actually makes it a little more

207
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,170
difficult we can't just overwrite the no

208
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,589
value and then you know reading some

209
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:37,270
arbitrary data after that like

210
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,520
interesting I've never seen a packet

211
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:51,670
elsewhere instructor will of my life so

212
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,190
here's the first one and note in the F

213
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,130
there is just a bar string and tonight

214
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,270
to put foster and 2727 together both of

215
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,080
those we gained 255 bytes

216
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,530
this is especially black classic Butler

217
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,430
overflow but with modern sections click

218
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,890
to stack quickly and it goes max

219
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,120
perience we

220
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,209
almost exactly the same and finally

221
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:29,379
right there's also a good one this one

222
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,029
was actually the one I decided to focus

223
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:37,240
on because it seemed a lot more fun so

224
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,360
this is a very simple example of a CCL

225
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,819
script all this does is leaders

226
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,699
basically sex really well it looks

227
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,610
similar to a single code similarly what

228
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,730
the top increment number tries my one

229
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,199
write hello world

230
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,970
we'll put a new label check to see if we

231
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,480
had a number of tries is greater than

232
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,040
five it is jump to three otherwise come

233
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,379
back to one and come in again so print

234
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:13,360
hello world five times these are always

235
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,769
like a manatee get in there

236
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:20,160
a lot of these are interesting but they

237
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,019
kind of all come into play once you're

238
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:25,809
trying to create this cooking concept

239
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:29,800
exploit strip those are some of the more

240
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,459
interesting one so yeah so my first idea

241
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:37,300
was how about being Note one so I can

242
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,990
somehow grab the stack 30 earlier in

243
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,269
memory there'd be no problem just

244
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:46,120
rewriting that and then next C is duck

245
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,829
complaint

246
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:53,410
nothing then boy the interesting one was

247
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,459
slightly more difficult has it had more

248
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:01,149
constraints these are the basic gadgets

249
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:05,079
I had to work with the return

250
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,040
the man is essentially a limited 16 hit

251
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,459
read to the script

252
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:18,149
well it's almost I'll get to that later

253
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,139
jsr 16-bit write some tiny controls we

254
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,410
can almost create a full turn place

255
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,449
machines just on this information

256
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,360
there's some of the pillars so you can

257
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,800
see here it says a crispy taco sack if

258
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,460
it's equal to be a maximum type of start

259
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,850
you can do this if not it doesn't think

260
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,760
what if top stack is greater or less

261
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:58,010
than and I want to point out that doing

262
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,130
the right overflow we can overwrite but

263
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,050
a sweet type of stack and there is the

264
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,270
script line fantasies there so we

265
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,650
control the stack around the top of

266
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,310
stack so it's very nice

267
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,589
reading reproductive almost other

268
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,450
gadgets so the next feeding memory there

269
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,350
so you want to try and find you know

270
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,900
where our members out of taking space we

271
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,560
can actually compare the bytes there one

272
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,670
we have in a vertical strip we can

273
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:47,410
actually find where it shows that we're

274
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,520
solving it drives and recharge earlier

275
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,740
easily to use for it well

276
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,360
conditionals I was also thinking you

277
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,930
typically use X to store lots or this

278
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,600
furnishing but might be in doing a

279
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,110
little cheating oh yes and we can also

280
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,570
have these different states but when it

281
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:20,080
answered when it all started

282
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,690
yeah thanks between these two we had

283
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,040
should be a backswing right fortunately

284
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,920
a Thursday support pitfalls involved in

285
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:42,400
this so the maximum size of the script

286
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,510
is 32 kilobytes

287
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:51,970
days 32 tonight sorry doesn't kill mites

288
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,520
of characters for 32 kilobytes of lines

289
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,850
whichever comes first

290
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,240
so we're limited you those reads I said

291
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,070
either under 0 7 ffff and we can only

292
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:14,440
write 0 X 7 epithet the way it works

293
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,820
it's all based on yes line ever again so

294
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,419
one issue with this it means if you want

295
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:27,240
to write the value 0 X 2 0

296
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,460
do you want to exact the toxic you would

297
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,390
have to be at line 32 in the script it

298
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,630
also means you cannot read it or write

299
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:48,280
the same bike it also means that

300
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,910
unfortunately you cannot write to stack

301
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,910
you cannot create those addresses or you

302
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,880
cannot also the gadgets from yeah

303
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,860
dynamic linker because those are two

304
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,299
pardonable but we were in the

305
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:17,200
overflowing is starts back there's a

306
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,040
string buffer here 256 so everything

307
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,260
below that you can overwrite the stack

308
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,940
top of stack like

309
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,360
interesting thing about this is nesting

310
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,070
when it was only 16 but it was declined

311
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,850
there's a way to do so they're literally

312
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:49,360
indexing 32 bits and Saturday 16 already

313
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,250
I'm sure for all right but there's some

314
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,360
other fun stuff we can actually

315
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,360
overwrite beyond this one my personal

316
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,190
favorite is Gino stirring down there I

317
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,780
can James an audio and all those defined

318
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,620
as a Pascal string consisting of one

319
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,220
place that one body is a space zero to

320
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,660
zero but since we can overwrite this we

321
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,630
can actually also use it as a scratch

322
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,690
register if you look at how it's the bar

323
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,400
string if we string is greater than your

324
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,770
next on the strings it just returns that

325
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:41,560
to you know string literal right so as

326
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,860
far as how to exploit this we see Co

327
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,800
engines tight loop that basically is

328
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,830
constantly generating these callbacks

329
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,160
pictures you see it's basically just a

330
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,270
linked list which contains other

331
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,390
call-out structures to be executed in

332
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,330
order almost better than laughs

333
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:15,979
part of the problem is actually figuring

334
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:18,259
out a clear and memory these things are

335
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:20,749
something out of here because it's in a

336
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:22,239
very tightly

337
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:25,279
luckily though you can actually delay

338
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,999
this for a bit by adding a character

339
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:31,669
Glade it's back in the day modems are

340
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:36,320
really slow well they were slow by

341
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,989
today's standards by their standards

342
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:41,960
they were really really fast so they had

343
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,940
to go really really slowly defended

344
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,879
something gives you a little bit more

345
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:53,139
time and controlling the heat finally

346
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:57,649
position this is one it's actually kind

347
00:22:57,649 --> 00:23:04,519
of a freebie so it includes a resource

348
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,470
file for PvP so if you just crazy that

349
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,729
eg PRC in your home directory so will

350
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:15,279
automatically launch it shelter for you

351
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:22,099
whenever he is becomes online okay for

352
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,539
their lecture those routes

353
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:28,519
let you see it PCC it's probably fifty

354
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:31,539
guys that's it

355
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,239
but however you still need to code

356
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:43,889
execution for the persistent like

357
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,950
however lovingly a collection ships

358
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,479
nitpick by default and also next a

359
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:54,399
yeasty version at least ten excess fuel

360
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,690
exactly it's very simple like that Reina

361
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,019
pipes to tep kok day and you're using

362
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:05,859
Apple's own sign programs to service

363
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:22,629
exploit Apple doesn't use Apple Mac OSX

364
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:26,559
phones I eventually just shared this

365
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,399
with them a quick they even working on

366
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:34,839
the VPN application they might not go

367
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,359
comfortable I'm quoting all this VPN

368
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:45,519
bugs so I see reporting the hooked up a

369
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,679
little bit of a reputation within many

370
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,089
years finally got it into the App Store

371
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:58,169
as the very first beat the entire wall

372
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:03,839
that was definitely not anything but

373
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,179
this is only a scratch on the surface of

374
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:09,460
the number of bugs in there this was the

375
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,149
path of least resistance there are other

376
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:17,849
ones which look like demand injections

377
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,599
quite a few more it's a very very old

378
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:25,989
portion of only actually very people

379
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:27,239
even understand it

380
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:30,309
however you can't really have a VPN

381
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:33,279
security product if the BPM on the phone

382
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,710
is broken

383
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,129
so really hoping that more people will

384
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:42,059
start looking into this

385
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,670
we're doing some amazing things here at

386
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:56,280
13 or 13 I should be out oh especially

387
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,090
out of later next month and I had some

388
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,180
other amazing things in the pipeline so

389
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:10,920
working on the future and that's about

390
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,160
it
