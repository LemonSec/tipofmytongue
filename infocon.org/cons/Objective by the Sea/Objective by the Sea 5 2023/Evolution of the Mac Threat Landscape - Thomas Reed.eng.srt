1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,559
bye

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,780
as many of you know Thomas he's a

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,320
incredible Mac malware research and and

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,780
obts OG as well I think he's talked at

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,240
every single objective by the Sea so

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,070
round of applause to Thomas Reed

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,580
[Applause]

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,800
all right can everybody hear yeah sounds

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,099
like it so hey everybody

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,300
um so today we're going to be talking

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,000
about the evolution of the Mac threat

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,399
landscape I've been around for a while

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,719
now

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,540
um I've been using Mac since 1984 and

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,520
I've seen a lot of things

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,520
um I think my first piece of Mac malware

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,200
I ever saw was in 1992 with a campus

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,719
computer lab so

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,700
I've seen a lot of interesting things

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,980
over the years so that we'd start out

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,800
this morning with something

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,840
fairly non-technical and talk about some

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,660
of the old malware that has been around

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,180
and sort of comparing contrast with what

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,760
we're seeing today so you know old

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,880
behaviors compared to to new ones

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,799
just a little bit about me to start off

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,680
with as mentioned my name is Thomas Reed

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,720
I work for Malwarebytes I'm director of

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,140
core technology there and a big part of

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,540
my job there is really knowing that the

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,960
Mac threat landscape and the Mac

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,619
you know customers

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,460
so let's kick it off here with the the

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,640
very first

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,740
widespread virus so this is not the

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,860
first virus there were other viruses

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,900
before this but the really first first

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,240
really widespread one

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,100
contrary to popular belief actually

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,799
affected Apple devices so it was the elk

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,220
cloner virus in 1982 and it affected the

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,740
Apple II computer

44
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,060
it spread through floppy disks and um on

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,119
the I believe it was the hundredth run

46
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,459
of the virus it would display this

47
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,959
little poem

48
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,280
um on the screen

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
so really it was kind of just a prank it

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,080
was just for fun you know nothing

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,599
malicious about it

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,280
um although apparently it did crash some

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,280
computers but you know this is kind of

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,080
the way that viruses started is they

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,060
were just kind of proof of Concepts and

56
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,000
pranks to start off with

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
these days we don't really see a lot of

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
viruses on the Mac anymore or even on

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,739
Windows for that matter um you know

60
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,780
viruses are much less common these days

61
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,700
than they used to be

62
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,680
um but we have seen a few things that

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,440
had virus-like Behavior so back in 2020

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,440
we saw Thief Quest

65
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,580
which was

66
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,160
um some malware that among other things

67
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,400
that it did it actually infected

68
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,260
binaries that were found in the user's

69
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,239
home folder now of course in the user's

70
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,739
home folder you don't need any special

71
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,080
permissions there

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,420
so it could freely infect the binaries

73
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,160
and what it did is it pre-pended the

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,440
malicious code onto those binaries so

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,440
that the malicious code would run and

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,200
then it could run the legit code make it

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,000
look like nothing was wrong

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,239
one of the biggest examples of binaries

79
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,120
that it infected this way were a number

80
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,519
of Google helper processes that at the

81
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,080
time were stored in the user's

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,560
application support folder I did notice

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
that these are no longer there on my

84
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
latest system so apparently Google

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,280
learned not to put binaries there now

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,220
the good news here was that Google

87
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,120
actually detected this so if you were

88
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,340
running an infected system and your

89
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,640
Google helper processes had gotten

90
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,400
corrupted gotten infected and then you

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,860
open chrome chrome was smart enough that

92
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,720
it would actually notice the files had

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,340
been modified and it would delete them

94
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,159
and replace them with new copies

95
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,280
um but who knows what other processes

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,400
might have been infected and and not had

97
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,159
that benefit of of you know that kind of

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,019
intelligence

99
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,940
um

100
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,540
so we also you know we we think of

101
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,639
polymorphic and encrypted malware as

102
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,979
being something relatively recent and

103
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,419
sophisticated

104
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,120
but this actually was you know seen back

105
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,540
in 1988 with Seven Dust on the Mac

106
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,600
um this was another virus

107
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,060
um you know viruses were really the big

108
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,699
you know the main source of malware back

109
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,040
in that day

110
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,600
and this was you know there were a lot

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
of a lot of different versions of Seven

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,780
Dust

113
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,419
um lots of you know encryption and and

114
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,660
what not to keep it from um being

115
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,040
detected

116
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,639
um

117
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,400
and this was getting a little bit more

118
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,259
malicious so some versions of the

119
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,800
malware actually would delete files

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
um you know it claimed that it could

121
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,000
speed up your graphics

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,940
um operations but it really didn't do

123
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,040
any of that and did some malicious

124
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,139
things and you know it was a little more

125
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,660
than just a prank

126
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,419
so these days and we've we've seen some

127
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,539
of this in earlier talks yesterday there

128
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,699
are a lot of obfuscation and encryption

129
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,880
techniques out there these days so a lot

130
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,060
of what we see are on the Mac are

131
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,340
obfuscated shell scripts so up here on

132
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,500
the screen is an example of a launch

133
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,360
Agent P list

134
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,340
and you can see there that what it's

135
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,340
doing is it's taking a base 64 encoded

136
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,539
string

137
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,660
and it's passing it to

138
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,539
um you know base64 to decode it and then

139
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,510
piping that to bash

140
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,840
[Music]

141
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,039
and this is a very typical trick you

142
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,100
know which it's almost it almost defeats

143
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,900
the purpose because you know if you just

144
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,940
look for stuff like this where you're

145
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,400
seeing something getting piped to base64

146
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,780
and then to bash or to sh or zsh

147
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,780
that's an immediate sign that you're

148
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,759
dealing with something malicious so why

149
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
even bother obfuscating when you've got

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
these obvious

151
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,620
um you know indicators here

152
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,840
upx is also a very common method for

153
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,220
encrypting malware on Mac OS so you know

154
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,100
that keeps you know reverse Engineers

155
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,560
from being able to easily you know look

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,819
at it and you've got to jump through

157
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,919
some hoops to decrypt it

158
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,800
uh we also see lots of Highly obfuscated

159
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,139
binary code and I forget who but

160
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,880
somebody showed some examples of that

161
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,800
yesterday

162
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,520
there are all kinds of different

163
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,860
examples lots of malware uses custom

164
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,199
code and they'll do things like do you

165
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,960
know basically just bit shift strings or

166
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,680
they'll you know have you know strings

167
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,139
where they've got numbers for you know

168
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,539
each ASCII character that are separated

169
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,699
by different characters or you know all

170
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,199
kinds of different techniques they use

171
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,220
to hide the strings that they're using

172
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,900
um somebody also talked about compiled

173
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,080
Apple script so there's really not been

174
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,740
an easy way to decompile and analyze

175
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,740
compiled Apple scripts there are some

176
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,479
ways these days but they're not perfect

177
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,220
they're definitely not up to the level

178
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,979
where you know you you can be at with

179
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,139
your typical binary code with opening it

180
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,419
up with Ida or Hopper or something like

181
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,740
that

182
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,840
and then of course the bane of any

183
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
reverse engineer you know or apps built

184
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,380
with go or rust or electron and you know

185
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,740
they just you you makes you want to tear

186
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,180
your hair out when you see one of these

187
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,520
because it's they're just they're a pain

188
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,380
in the butt to to figure out what what

189
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,800
they're doing

190
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,500
so back in 95 we saw the first word

191
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,319
macro virus was called concept and

192
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,819
that's really what it was it was just a

193
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,460
proof of concept

194
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,160
it was not malicious but this was the

195
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,560
first cross-platform malware so this

196
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,900
could infect Max and windows machines

197
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,300
which was you know

198
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,360
really new at the time blew everybody's

199
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Minds unfortunately this malware

200
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,060
actually you know brought in the era of

201
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,580
word macro viruses being really common

202
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,379
and widespread

203
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,299
which brought about the end of John

204
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,299
norstad's excellent disinfectant gap for

205
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,919
those of you who are old enough to to

206
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,140
remember that

207
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,899
um you know let's let's that was a just

208
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,779
the best app uh best security app ever

209
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,140
at the time and and you know really just

210
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,320
crushed me to see that go away

211
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,140
um and and this was the reason because

212
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,240
it just couldn't couldn't cope with the

213
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,380
word macro viruses

214
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,480
um so these days word macro malware

215
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,820
really isn't it it used to be more

216
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,459
common than it is now I still see it

217
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,860
being you know fairly popular with red

218
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,180
teams

219
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,839
um

220
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,600
I think maybe some red teamers might

221
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,600
you know agree or disagree but it seems

222
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,120
like it's popular with red teams

223
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,399
where we do see it in the wild it tends

224
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,120
to be more targeted you know because

225
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,380
you've gotta you've got to use some kind

226
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,420
of a Sandbox Escape which means you've

227
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,399
got to have

228
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,500
um you know a certain version of Word or

229
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,560
Mac OS in order to Target that and

230
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,060
you've got to know your adverse your

231
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,140
your

232
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,360
um not your adversary your your victim

233
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,800
is

234
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,519
um

235
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,100
running a vulnerable version of the

236
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,820
software you can see here actually

237
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,480
um

238
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,839
this this example here is some malware

239
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,600
that actually stole directly from a

240
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,959
proof of concept made by Adam Chester

241
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,480
um and you know you can see it it

242
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,320
actually uses the xpn SEC name there so

243
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,180
it's kind of a giveaway that it stole

244
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,519
his code

245
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,500
and this used a Sandbox Escape that

246
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,040
actually no longer works I actually I

247
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,800
tested it just to see before the talk I

248
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,480
was just curious if it still worked and

249
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,700
it it doesn't work anymore

250
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,080
hahaha

251
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,839
but interestingly word macros do still

252
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,240
exist on Mac they still you can still

253
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,180
enable them which

254
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,860
I don't know why Microsoft thinks that's

255
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,920
a good idea but I think it should they

256
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,579
should just die

257
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,160
um

258
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,600
there we go

259
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,579
looks like we skipped one

260
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,500
something's something's wonky here

261
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,620
what is going on here

262
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,060
let me just start that over

263
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,459
all right there we go so the first back

264
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,300
door was in 2004 when renapo it was also

265
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,060
called opener although rent a post kind

266
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,440
of a better name because opener is a

267
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,300
real common word

268
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,240
um and this was a Trojan unlike of you

269
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
know a lot of the stuff that had come

270
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,260
before was more virusy

271
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,779
and it was really the first Mac back

272
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,920
door to exfiltrated a lot of data

273
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,839
another thing that it did is it changed

274
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,300
a lot of system settings to make them

275
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,760
less secure

276
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,200
and that's that's also something we see

277
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,339
today with certain things

278
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,060
um

279
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,300
today it seems like almost every piece

280
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,880
of malware for Mac is has a back door of

281
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,700
some kind and there are so many

282
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,380
different kinds of back doors out there

283
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,519
I mean you know it's anything from a you

284
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,459
know um some some kind of Open Source

285
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:03,420
tool like eggshell or or Empire or

286
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,519
something like that

287
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,959
um to just your basic reverse shell

288
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,820
to something like a Cobalt strike Beacon

289
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,040
we've actually seen Mac malware that has

290
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,220
used Cobalt strike beacons in its

291
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,260
operations

292
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,839
um but one of the things that we often

293
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,959
see with Mac malware is just custom

294
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,480
backdoor code just written in Objective

295
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,000
C or Swift you know compiled Mako

296
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,260
binaries

297
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,140
and that's hard to detect because you

298
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,660
know depending on the obfuscation and

299
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,399
exactly what they're doing it might be

300
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,980
really you know really tough to to spot

301
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,060
that

302
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,620
um unless you're you know doing

303
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,300
something like with EDR where you're

304
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,220
looking at behaviors and not the

305
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,560
compiled code

306
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,019
um and here you can see an example of

307
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,500
some custom back door code this was

308
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,019
decompiled in in Hopper

309
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,360
and you can basically see that it's just

310
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,420
taking a string that it receives and

311
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,540
it's passing it to bash essentially so

312
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,180
just running a running a script with

313
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,040
Bash

314
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,139
so that's that's a fairly common

315
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,120
technique that a lot of malware uses

316
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,860
so in 2007 we saw RS plug which was kind

317
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,380
of the first real financially based

318
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,420
malware so this was malware that

319
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,579
actually it was also called DNS changer

320
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,860
because it would change your DNS

321
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,959
settings and it would set it set your

322
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,019
your DNS to a malicious server

323
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,480
uh and it did this for the purpose of

324
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,760
fishing so that it could actually change

325
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,000
the server to a mo you know for certain

326
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,579
sites to a malicious site to try and get

327
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,100
your credentials and get basically your

328
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,120
money

329
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,440
um

330
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,779
and this was eventually shut down by the

331
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,519
FBI it's kind of an interesting story

332
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,459
the FBI shut down they they caught the

333
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,980
people responsible they shut it all down

334
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,100
but because so many people had been

335
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,680
infected with RS plug this was really

336
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,940
widespread

337
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,279
the FBI couldn't just shut down the DNS

338
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,899
server if they did there would have been

339
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,300
hundreds of thousands of people whose

340
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,980
internet would suddenly stop working on

341
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,079
their computers and and you know they

342
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,579
wouldn't have understood why folks like

343
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,740
us we you know that we might think okay

344
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,380
let me go check the DNS settings your

345
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,579
average user they're going to be like

346
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,740
why is my computer not connecting to the

347
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,380
internet and and they'd have no idea

348
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,560
so what the FBI actually did is they ran

349
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,040
that malicious DNS server although they

350
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,839
removed the malicious entries they still

351
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,500
ran that server for years afterwards

352
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,139
until they finally decided okay we're

353
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,260
seeing less traffic on the DNS server

354
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,720
now and and it was they deemed it was

355
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,680
safe to shut it down

356
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,779
so obviously these days everybody knows

357
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,579
you know lots of malware is financially

358
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:00,959
motivated

359
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,880
um there are lots of things involving

360
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,279
cryptocurrency especially so crypto

361
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,100
Miners and Steelers lots of things that

362
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,160
pretend to be wallets or trading apps

363
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,320
that really are there to steal your

364
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,480
cryptocurrency

365
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,180
um we also see things that steal

366
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,279
information for the purpose of selling

367
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,380
it you know so things like credentials

368
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,540
or you know that sort of thing that's

369
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,600
all very valuable to these you know

370
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,060
malware creators

371
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,060
so these have been a little bit less

372
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,279
common this year I have I don't think

373
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,740
that I've seen a new crypto Miner all

374
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,260
year which is this is the first year I I

375
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,120
haven't seen one of those

376
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,079
maybe because cryptocurrency is kind of

377
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:49,860
not doing so great but we did see one

378
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,480
new piece of malware this year that was

379
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,519
more financially motivated which was

380
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,220
Trader Trader this was

381
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,980
thought to be North Korean always kind

382
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,320
of you know

383
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,160
I'm always a little leery of attribution

384
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,560
so I will say it's thought to be North

385
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,680
Korean and it sort of was a combination

386
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,880
of spyware plus a Steeler that was aimed

387
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,399
at stealing your cryptocurrency and

388
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,019
North Korea seems to have a particular

389
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,880
interest in that in stealing

390
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,519
cryptocurrency

391
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,380
I don't know how that's working out for

392
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,519
them these days but

393
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,120
um so then back in 2008 we saw the first

394
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,839
pop now these days we are Awash in pups

395
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,899
or potentially unwanted programs they're

396
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,720
everywhere but at the time they they

397
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,420
really didn't exist until 2008 with Max

398
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,660
sweeper and this was kind of an

399
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,519
interesting program it was one of these

400
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,860
junk cleaning tools that we see so much

401
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,279
of today it would use some kind of

402
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,040
sneaky and and underhanded ways of

403
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,839
getting onto your computer and then once

404
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,940
there tell you all look at all these

405
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,280
problems oh my gosh your caches your

406
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,660
caches you got to clean them

407
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,099
and of course if you wanted to clean

408
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,500
them you couldn't because you'd have to

409
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,220
purchase the software first so um you

410
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,799
know it was kind of it it opened the

411
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,980
door there to the that entire industry

412
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,500
that that we see on the Mac and on

413
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,380
Windows these days

414
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,220
um

415
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,640
so today as I said pups are just

416
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,620
everywhere we see all kinds of these

417
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,960
junk cleaning apps that you know just

418
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,700
throw up their hands and say oh my gosh

419
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,320
look at all this horrible stuff that's

420
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,440
going on on your system you know

421
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,660
um they they call out things like caches

422
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,480
and log files and and that sort of thing

423
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,880
as major problems

424
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,080
um

425
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,860
and we also see some scam AV apps out

426
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,059
there as well

427
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,919
um and these These are generally

428
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,799
programs that have licensed

429
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,620
a free AV engine or maybe not even

430
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,280
licensed or just using it

431
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,880
and you know they they you know Market

432
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,640
themselves as a legit AV app but they

433
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,440
use some kind of shady techniques for

434
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,480
getting installed and for you know

435
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,559
pushing you real hard towards a purchase

436
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,240
um and a lot of these things come in

437
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,460
especially the junk AV apps they come in

438
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,500
through these sites that you you know

439
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,539
can get to through advertising or a

440
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,059
variety of different means that will you

441
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,799
know throw up these big your infected

442
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,260
messages and you know of course you

443
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,760
click through and you download whatever

444
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,760
it tells you to to get usually it says

445
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,100
you're infected with tap snake that's

446
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,020
like the the big thing that they say

447
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,900
which is very funny because tap snake is

448
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,120
not only Android malware but it's

449
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,940
Android malware that's kind of dead at

450
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,919
this point but still it's a big threat

451
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,760
to your Mac right

452
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,900
and so you you know you download through

453
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,440
these sites and you've got your your pup

454
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,100
um

455
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,799
and unfortunately some of these AV apps

456
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,799
now have system extensions which makes

457
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,440
them really difficult to remove

458
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,820
um you know basically those system

459
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,940
extensions are protected by Mac OS

460
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,580
so you know there's there's nothing that

461
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,400
you can do other than

462
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,860
um you know remove the app through a

463
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,679
very specific method so if your

464
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,380
antivirus software removes it system

465
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,660
extensions there forever basically

466
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,340
we also see a lot of scam apps in the

467
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,620
App Store so that there's been a big

468
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,559
problem with that in recent years you

469
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,780
know a lot of these apps that have the

470
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,720
the subscription scams like they trick

471
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
you into you know purchasing a

472
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
subscription that's going to charge you

473
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,539
20 bucks weekly or something like that

474
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,280
and what a lot of these apps do so

475
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,140
there's an example here on the screen

476
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,380
this my metronome app

477
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,059
um basically what it did is when you

478
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,000
open it up it would show this window

479
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,100
there was no way to close it the only

480
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,960
way to get rid of the window was to

481
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,240
click the purchase button you couldn't

482
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,919
quit the app you couldn't close the

483
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,480
window

484
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,120
um so if you didn't know that force quit

485
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,539
existed like you know most users then

486
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,039
you're kind of stuck

487
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,200
and the way that they get away with this

488
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,480
is they actually will do things like

489
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,460
they've they've got a flag that they can

490
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,520
set in the app that tells it don't show

491
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,580
this you know particular UI while it's

492
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,980
in review and then as soon as the app is

493
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,500
through review and accepted by Apple

494
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,440
then they flipped the flag and suddenly

495
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,059
the app starts showing this malicious

496
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,480
behavior

497
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,500
and then in 2010 we saw our first adware

498
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,220
and this was opinion spy AKA Premier

499
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,320
opinion is the name that's the name of

500
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,200
the company behind it

501
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,340
at the time and this was such an

502
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,500
innocent time they called this spyware

503
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,320
like you know like this is spying on

504
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,240
people you know because it was

505
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,580
monitoring Network traffic yeah I mean

506
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,700
technically that's kind of spyware but

507
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,580
in modern times we know like you know

508
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,559
there's a lot worse you can do with

509
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,799
spyware than that so these days we would

510
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,620
consider this to be adware

511
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,419
um because it's really just essentially

512
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,159
a Tracker tracked all your network

513
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,360
traffic and and then monetize that data

514
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,340
and they're still around they're still

515
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,799
doing this today just in different ways

516
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,620
this adware was first found in a whole

517
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,520
bunch of screen savers from Seven art so

518
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,960
if you went and downloaded one of these

519
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,460
screensavers then you'd have something

520
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,780
on your system

521
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,159
tracking all your your network

522
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:57,600
operations all of your your websites

523
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,700
you're visiting

524
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,480
so adware today is everywhere this is

525
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,760
one of the top detections you know

526
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,039
between adware and pups

527
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,000
that makes up almost all of the

528
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,860
detections that we see at Malwarebytes

529
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,900
you know malware is just a little

530
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,240
fraction of that

531
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,080
um and it ironically adware is often far

532
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,360
more sophisticated than most of the

533
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,280
malware that's out there

534
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,940
um

535
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,340
now because of some of the changes Apple

536
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,260
has made in recent years regarding

537
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,360
signing code signing and notarization

538
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
requirements a lot of this stuff is no

539
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,700
longer signed some still is and then

540
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,980
it's a whack-a-mole game for Apple

541
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,380
but a lot of times they're they just

542
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,080
don't bother anymore and so what you'll

543
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,840
see is something like this where they'll

544
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,780
you know pop open a window in a DMG and

545
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,400
they'll give you some basic instructions

546
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,059
you know control click and choose open

547
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:59,940
and that'll bypass and let let it run

548
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,159
even though it's not signed now of

549
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,840
course Apple can still block this with

550
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,179
xprotect if they've seen them the adware

551
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,520
before but that doesn't always happen

552
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,159
and as we mentioned earlier there was

553
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,780
some malware that

554
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,080
um in in the good old days that caused a

555
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,820
lot of changes to the system and and

556
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,700
created a lot of security holes adware

557
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,440
today does the same thing it will do

558
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,240
things like make changes to your pseudos

559
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,500
file

560
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,820
um you know we've seen things where

561
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,640
every user is allowed to use sudo

562
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,679
without a password

563
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,980
because adware made that change

564
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,900
it'll install

565
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,940
proxy servers so it's basically man in

566
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,539
the middling all of your network traffic

567
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:47,100
and even if you remove the adware a lot

568
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,960
of times you might not be getting that

569
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,140
you know that proxy removed

570
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,780
um so lots and lots of things that

571
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,780
adword does that affects the security of

572
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,520
your system as a whole and even if you

573
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,760
remove the malware it's your system's

574
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,380
still insecure

575
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,220
and it's very very sneaky lots of

576
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,559
analysis evasion you know it can tell if

577
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,720
you're running it in a VM it can tell if

578
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,700
you're you've got a you know Hopper on

579
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,120
your system something like that

580
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,840
um

581
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,020
and and lots of really sneaky and

582
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,760
creative ways of getting the adware

583
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,679
installed so we saw one piece of adware

584
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,220
not too long ago that would actually

585
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,840
when you installed it it would make a

586
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,380
copy of safari in a temporary location

587
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,299
and then it would change a Javascript

588
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,480
file inside of safari to automatically

589
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,720
accept a particular system extension

590
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,880
then it would pop open that version of

591
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,159
safari while the screen is obscured by

592
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,480
other things

593
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,159
and then close it again and then delete

594
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,460
it now at that point you open the legit

595
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,380
copy of safari and their system

596
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,720
extension is installed

597
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,620
no user input needed so you know you the

598
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,960
usual thing you see asking you to accept

599
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,960
the system extension or the the browser

600
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,940
extension

601
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,400
didn't happen

602
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,700
and and so you know there have been a

603
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,700
number of very Creative Solutions from

604
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,559
the adware folks to this requirement

605
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,600
that the user has to click something to

606
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,340
accept the the browser extension

607
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,200
that's basically it that's a little

608
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,799
um

609
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,620
kind of a summary of how things have

610
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,500
evolved over the years and interestingly

611
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,419
a lot of the techniques that we see

612
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,380
today

613
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,039
actually got their start as early as the

614
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,880
early 80s so very interesting stuff out

615
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,140
there any questions

616
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,200
unfortunately no so when it comes to

617
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,900
pups apple is in kind of a little bit of

618
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,799
a hard place unless you can prove

619
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,520
that they're doing something wrong

620
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,760
Apple you know from from my

621
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,799
interpretation Apple feels like they

622
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,799
can't be the one to say no you're not

623
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,200
allowed to use certain apps like mac

624
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
keeper

625
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,020
um

626
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,320
so unless you can prove actual

627
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,419
wrongdoing

628
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,340
which is difficult with a lot of these

629
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,500
pups then Apple's not going to take any

630
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,480
action

631
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,480
unfortunately

632
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,720
absolutely yeah

633
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,260
yeah so I I can't speak for other

634
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,360
vendors but yeah Malwarebytes one of our

635
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,840
big focuses is on the pups you know we

636
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,740
have a really strong stance against pups

637
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,260
and um we are you know we have lawyers

638
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,779
that are willing to stand behind us on

639
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,279
that

640
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,360
um and so yeah that's Apple's hands are

641
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,640
kind of tied and I I understand why you

642
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,140
know if you're

643
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,380
Apple you're a huge company you know

644
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,740
you've got this monolithic platform that

645
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,100
could almost be accused of being a

646
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,440
monopoly and then they start telling you

647
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,480
no no you can't use that app because we

648
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,760
think it's bad

649
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,640
um not because it's doing anything

650
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,779
outright malicious we just think it's

651
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:49,919
bad

652
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,159
that wouldn't be a good look for Apple

653
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,659
um even though we would all applaud it

654
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,220
if they blocked some of these things it

655
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,600
wouldn't you know wouldn't be a good

656
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,400
look for them so that's where the third

657
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,580
party vendors really come in as we can

658
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,679
we can take action on that when Apple

659
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,039
can't

660
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,179
any other questions

661
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:14,539
oh yep

662
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,919
I

663
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,539
I don't think that was actually animated

664
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,179
but that would have been diabolical yeah

665
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,640
that would have really that would have

666
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,559
put the nail right in the coffin there

667
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:45,480
yeah I think

668
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,179
um with with pups and adware and one of

669
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,460
the the most concerning things about

670
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,919
them is that they

671
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,679
um are are very focused on finding that

672
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,740
line where they don't

673
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,220
yeah where people can't detect them

674
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,620
um you know not not that they

675
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,260
actually can't but where they feel like

676
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,100
they shouldn't legally speaking and they

677
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,260
try and find that line and ride that

678
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,320
line really really close

679
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,179
um and and that's where some of the

680
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:21,360
problems lie not from a practical you

681
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
know detection standpoint but from a

682
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,659
legal standpoint it's

683
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:28,740
it's something that a lot of people

684
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,960
really just don't want to deal with

685
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,679
um

686
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,620
and I'm kind of lucky because you know I

687
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,440
have had legal threats before over stuff

688
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,299
like this I actually had an adware

689
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,340
company before I was working at

690
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,620
Malwarebytes threatened to sue me if I

691
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,360
didn't take down a whole bunch of blog

692
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,340
posts

693
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,360
um

694
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,940
and and that scared the crap out of me

695
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,279
but I'm I'm very fortunate that now I've

696
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,399
got folks that will stand behind me and

697
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,179
um

698
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,360
support me in in that sort of thing

699
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,399
but still it's it's a problem it's a

700
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,439
it's a legal problem so

701
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,340
anybody else

702
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,620
yeah

703
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,840
it's pretty large I don't know exactly

704
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,539
how many miles or how big on disk but I

705
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:25,260
have samples going all the way back

706
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,679
um to the very early days I don't have

707
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,620
samples of every piece of malware that

708
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,779
has ever existed for Mac but I'm pretty

709
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,580
close

710
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,919
so

711
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,279
yeah

712
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,980
yeah

713
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,559
so most of them the the most prevalent

714
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,559
malware that we see these days which I'm

715
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,360
saying malware but really it's pups and

716
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,700
adware

717
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,620
the the biggest source of that these

718
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,899
days is from malvertising you know so

719
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,840
you're on some legitimate site and

720
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,340
there's a malicious ad that's been

721
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,860
injected into the the ad feed for that

722
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,559
site and that malicious ad ends up

723
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,720
redirecting you to one of these scam

724
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,539
pages and then from there you download

725
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,120
either some kind of a pop or some kind

726
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,919
of adware

727
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,179
um and you're you know the user is

728
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,240
tricked into downloading these for one

729
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,799
reason or other either because your

730
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:35,039
system's infected or because

731
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,260
um look you have to you know there's

732
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,240
this content here that you can't see

733
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,640
because you need this plug-in it's it's

734
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,940
kind of ironic Flash Player is very dead

735
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,460
at this point and yet that they still

736
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,440
use that as a lure you know you've got

737
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,000
to install Flash player to see the

738
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,039
content

739
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,580
yeah

740
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,679
I haven't seen that no

741
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,880
um that's something that I probably

742
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,480
wouldn't have much visibility into

743
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,700
um so somebody else might have seen that

744
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,399
but I I haven't seen that personally

745
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,840
all right cool thanks everyone
