1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,640
uh next up we have josh he's going to be

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,920
talking about um well i'll let him dive

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,160
in but basically uh you know apple's

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,080
claims about patching older operating

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,440
systems which you know we've all been

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,520
told to patch and keep updated but you

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,520
know really what apple says is sometimes

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
different than uh the reality so let's

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,320
give josh a warm round of applause

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
all right awesome here we go

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
okay so the the title of my presentation

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,239
is n minus one and n minus two should we

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,719
really trust in you an examination of

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,680
mac os security updates

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
and uh so the n by the way that we're

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,960
talking about here is the a placeholder

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,879
for the current version of mac os 10

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,360
whatever that happens to be at the time

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,480
currently that is mac os big sur the n

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,199
minus one then is mac os catalina and

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,440
the n minus two currently is mac os

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,839
mojave

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
just briefly i'm the chief security

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,959
analyst at indigo i've

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,040
spent more than 20 years

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
doing all kinds of different kinds of

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,159
cyber security research and i i love

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,280
doing it and this is some of my latest

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
uh research

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,280
okay

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
um so this is a little bit of what we're

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,840
gonna cover today um there's there's a

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
few other things included in here but

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,000
uh we're gonna go over really briefly a

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,360
history of mac os security updates um

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,759
what has apple done in the past and and

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
that can sort of give us an idea of what

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,520
they're going to continue doing in the

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,280
future

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,600
we'll talk about whether new mac os

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
versions as they come out are inherently

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,960
safer

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,479
we'll talk about the 400 plus big sur

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,240
era vulnerabilities obviously we're not

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,159
going to get into a lot of details but

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,759
there are some pretty interesting ones

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,439
that we'll talk about

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,240
and then how does all this relate to ios

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,000
of course they share a similar code base

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,960
and

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,840
you know

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,080
are there implications for ios based on

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,720
this research that i've done into mac os

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,879
vulnerabilities

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,040
and and we'll talk about some some other

56
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,959
things that we can take away from this

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,120
hopefully regardless of whether you are

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,440
a system administrator whether you are

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
an individual user and are just curious

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
about what you can do to improve your

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,959
own security

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,480
we'll talk about some of those takeaways

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
as well

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,280
okay so first of all although the the

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,840
first max and thus the first mac

66
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
operating system were released in 1984

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
apple of course made a significant shift

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
in january 2001 when it released mac os

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,959
10.

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
in november 2003 this seems to have been

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
the first time that apple released a

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,680
security update for a previous operating

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
system

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,760
mac os x version 10.3.1 was the latest

75
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,280
at the time but apple released a

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,280
security update for 10.2.8

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,440
because releasing an update for an old

78
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,239
os was unprecedented apple actually made

79
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
a statement about it at the time

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,200
and this is that statement it is apple's

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,519
policy to quickly address significant

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,000
vulnerabilities in past releases of mac

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,959
os 10 wherever feasible

84
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,840
now that might be news to to probably

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
most of the people here like apple has

86
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,440
actually made statements about their

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,760
security patching policy

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,959
um but they actually did um it was back

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
in 2003 but they did make a statement

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,799
about it

91
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,640
and today really this remains one of the

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,959
very few public statements that apple

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,799
has ever made regarding its security

94
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,400
update policies

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,280
uh unlike microsoft for example um

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,840
they're very uh well-known for

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
announcing in advance like this is how

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,599
long we're going to support our

99
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,519
operating system this is how long we're

100
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,680
going to support uh this version of

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,799
microsoft office but apple never says

102
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
how long they're going to be releasing

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,879
updates for a given operating system or

104
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,679
software product

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,720
exactly one month after apple made this

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
statement apple made another interesting

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
statement along with the release of

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,880
security updates for mac os

109
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,399
10 versions 10.3 and 10.2

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,199
this is that statement and they say note

111
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,680
the following fixes which appear in

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
these two security updates

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,479
um

114
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,320
well they say so the following fixes

115
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,840
that are in the panther update are not

116
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,320
included in the jaguar update

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
so this is 10.3 and 10.2 that they're

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,440
talking about mac os versions since the

119
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,400
jaguar or 10.2 versions are

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,080
not vulnerable to these issues

121
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,960
okay that's actually pretty cool like

122
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
i'm kind of wondering why apple doesn't

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
still do this like this would be really

124
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,440
really useful information to have

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
but unfortunately apple no longer makes

126
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,199
statements like these which leaves open

127
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,000
to speculation why some vulnerabilities

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
don't get patched for some mac os

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,639
versions and we'll talk more about that

130
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,560
later

131
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,199
so apple followed a

132
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
pattern of n and n minus one approach

133
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,199
for many years from that point and they

134
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,960
were releasing security updates

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,199
typically for two mac os 10 versions at

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
a time and eventually they started the

137
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,720
practice of patching a few apps that i

138
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,639
suppose were then considered maybe

139
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,960
non-os software like itunes and

140
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,479
quicktime and safari for also the n-2

141
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,759
mac os 10 version as well

142
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,600
but then apple appears to have really

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,320
solidified the n minus 2 support in

144
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,479
september 2012 when they started

145
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,600
releasing security updates

146
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,240
simultaneously for mac os 10 versions

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
10.6 10.7 and 10.8

148
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,360
apple has followed similar practices

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,919
ever since then for the current and two

150
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,000
previous major mac os releases

151
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,759
okay so why do mac users sometimes not

152
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
upgrade to the latest mac os

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
there are a lot of different reasons

154
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,600
obviously it's going to vary depending

155
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
on the user

156
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,479
in some cases the user just doesn't

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,919
think they really need the new features

158
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,000
maybe they saw apple's

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,919
you know latest event and they kind of

160
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,080
go yeah none of that really impresses me

161
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,479
i'm fine with what i've got

162
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,240
maybe they're concerned about something

163
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
breaking when they upgrade and those

164
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,800
concerns might be well-founded because

165
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
for example

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,880
some people might know that

167
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,919
they might have heard that they can't

168
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,400
use their legacy apps anymore maybe it's

169
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
some old version of microsoft office

170
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
that they are still using for whatever

171
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,080
reason they just don't really want to

172
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,400
pay microsoft for the new version and

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
they have heard that it won't run if

174
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,160
they upgrade to the latest mac os so

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,840
maybe they stay on the old version for

176
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,280
that

177
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,919
also other macs may not really be

178
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,479
compatible with the latest os so if

179
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,319
you've got an older model

180
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,319
you really may not be eligible to

181
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,000
upgrade to mac macos

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
every

183
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,759
other version or so they tend to drop

184
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
support for certain mac models whatever

185
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,280
kind of happens to be on the list of of

186
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,919
devices that they apple now considers to

187
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,720
be legacy or obsolete products

188
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,039
and so some older macs simply just won't

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,199
run the latest mac os and

190
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,960
some users are blissfully unaware

191
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
they're you know they're using a an

192
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
eight or nine year old mac and they have

193
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,479
really no reason to upgrade because it

194
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,639
still works just fine for them so they

195
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,120
keep using it

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,800
okay so let's talk about a couple of mac

197
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
security myths or at least assumptions

198
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,840
that a reasonable person might make

199
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,479
myth number one new mac os versions are

200
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,879
inherently safer or in other words by

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
simple virtue of them being new they

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,199
must be safer right after all apple

203
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
added new security features they told us

204
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
about in a much hyped event

205
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
and they presumably fixed all the known

206
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,199
bugs and so we have nothing to worry

207
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,759
about right

208
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,639
well

209
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,879
not exactly and there have been a couple

210
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,199
of really major snafus

211
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,319
in apple's mac os release history where

212
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,400
they accidentally introduced some really

213
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,360
egregious security bugs in a major new

214
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
mac os release

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,240
let's go back in time to the release of

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,199
mac os 10.13 high sierra it shipped in

217
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,240
late 2017 with a pretty terrible bug

218
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
that became known as i am root

219
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
by simply typing root into the username

220
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,520
field of a permissions prompt and then

221
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,039
pressing return or clicking on the

222
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,760
default button twice you would actually

223
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,399
enable the root account and set a blank

224
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
password for the root account

225
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
this guy named patrick wardle right here

226
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,480
noted that the root account could also

227
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
be enabled remotely

228
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
oops

229
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
i'm going back a little further in time

230
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,279
another memorable apple security failure

231
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,760
was the infamous go to fail ssl bug

232
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,720
which came to light in february 2014.

233
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,959
because of an erroneously duplicated

234
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,399
line of code

235
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,959
os-10 mavericks treated broken ssl

236
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,959
certificates as valid

237
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
enabling man-in-the-middle attacks and

238
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,519
then after patching this for ios which

239
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,360
was also vulnerable apple took an

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,920
additional four days before releasing a

241
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,399
patch for macos

242
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,399
okay so let's talk about myth number two

243
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,640
all mac os security updates are created

244
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,600
equal

245
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
one might reasonably assume that since

246
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,480
apple's releasing security updates for

247
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
my mac once i install them my mac must

248
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
now be perfectly secure right

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,640
even though i'm still on an older macos

250
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
version i just got updates so i must be

251
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
secure

252
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,600
well as you've probably guessed by now

253
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
not exactly

254
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,279
in fact it turns out that's pretty far

255
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
from the truth but how can we find out

256
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,080
the truth of the matter

257
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,320
um there are some pretty significant

258
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,839
barriers that make it hard to get a

259
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,200
complete and accurate picture of exactly

260
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,040
how secure my version of mac os is

261
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,200
when apple doesn't patch something for

262
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
one or more operating system as we'll

263
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,839
see that they often do

264
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,720
is it because that vulnerability doesn't

265
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,839
affect that os for some reason

266
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,600
this isn't always clear especially when

267
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,760
dealing with proprietary or not well

268
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,399
documented apple os components

269
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
apple hasn't made public statements

270
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,240
about vulnerability applicability for

271
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,640
many years and apple generally doesn't

272
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,399
comment privately about such things

273
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,920
either

274
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,040
or perhaps

275
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
maybe apple really did patch it but they

276
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
just forgot to mention it in the

277
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,240
security release notes that's possible

278
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,640
too right either way apple's silence

279
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,519
means that we may have to rely on the

280
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,440
vulnerability reporters the researchers

281
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,399
that apple acknowledges to help answer

282
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,200
some of these questions for us

283
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
but even this isn't always easy many

284
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,839
researchers report vulnerabilities

285
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,200
anonymously

286
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
and may be difficult to find contact

287
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,720
information for some of them and there

288
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,800
can be other challenges as well

289
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
on the bright side i already knew some

290
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,680
of the researchers who had been

291
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,360
reporting vulnerabilities over the past

292
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
year so i at least had some place to

293
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,800
start

294
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
but before i even knew what questions to

295
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
ask researchers i had to start compiling

296
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,160
and analyzing data so i carefully

297
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,240
examined all of the details from every

298
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,480
macos security advisory since big sur

299
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,839
was released to present

300
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
by my account there have been 468

301
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,399
vulnerabilities that have been patched

302
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,320
over the past year so this is a shot of

303
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,839
my

304
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,440
spreadsheet that i put together

305
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
obviously it goes on

306
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
much longer than this

307
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,079
but this is just an idea of what sorts

308
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,320
of things i was looking at

309
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,079
and after organizing all of this data i

310
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,760
could see that there were definitely

311
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,000
differences in what got patched for one

312
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,720
mac os version versus another

313
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
after getting feedback from some

314
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,519
researchers i was able to clean up the

315
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,160
raw data somewhat in cases where they

316
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,399
knew that a vulnerability only affected

317
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,839
certain mac os versions and not

318
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,279
others so let's take a look at some

319
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,519
rough numbers as i mentioned

320
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,079
there are 468 total big sur era

321
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,920
vulnerabilities

322
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,079
and of those

323
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,440
217 vulnerabilities were patched for all

324
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,600
three of the currently supported

325
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
operating systems big sur catalina and

326
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
mojave

327
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,519
154 vulnerabilities were only patched in

328
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,200
big sur

329
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
74 vulnerabilities were only patched in

330
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,720
big sur and catalina so n and n minus

331
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
one

332
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,399
11 vulnerabilities were patched in only

333
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,880
catalina and mojave so if we're trying

334
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,240
to kind of figure this out it could

335
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,839
either be that

336
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,480
perhaps maybe big sur wasn't vulnerable

337
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,959
anymore maybe they made some underlying

338
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,560
changes and

339
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,720
now big big sur

340
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
is not affected by whatever

341
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
vulnerability may still apply to

342
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,000
catalina and mojave that could be

343
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,920
seven vulnerabilities were patched only

344
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
in catalina

345
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
which okay again maybe there's like

346
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,279
something that

347
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,760
was going on in catalina's development

348
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,880
where there's something that only

349
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,959
affects that one operating system that's

350
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
possible and also two vulnerabilities

351
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,440
were patched only in mojave

352
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,760
but this one is really weird

353
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
three vulnerabilities were patched in

354
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
only big sur

355
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,120
and mojave

356
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,959
so you're telling me

357
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,519
that there was a vulnerability in

358
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,680
the oldest one

359
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,760
[Music]

360
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
not the middle one but also the next one

361
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,440
like how how does that happen

362
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,839
exactly

363
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,760
um and of course i reached out to apple

364
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
and asked these questions

365
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,399
i did not get an answer

366
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,720
yeah

367
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,160
but

368
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,519
there's one more thing

369
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,000
sometimes apple annotates

370
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,600
a vulnerability with these words they'll

371
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
say apple is aware of a report that this

372
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,240
issue may have been actively exploited

373
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,639
and specifically this has happened 15

374
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,880
times since the release of macos big sur

375
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,279
last fall now actively exploited is

376
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,480
apple's way of saying that these

377
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,639
vulnerabilities have been used by actual

378
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,720
attackers so they've actually been

379
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,160
observed in use in the wild or have

380
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,399
reportedly been used in targeted attacks

381
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,519
so of those 15 vulnerabilities six of

382
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,160
them in red on this chart were patched

383
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,360
for only big sur four of them in yellow

384
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
were patched for only big sur and

385
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
catalina

386
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,199
and five of them in green were patched

387
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,680
for all of the currently supported mac

388
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,079
os releases including mojave now there's

389
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,240
a little asterisk on that one because

390
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,560
one vulnerability the one that cedric

391
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,399
jaron and patrick spoke about a little

392
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,920
while ago this morning

393
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,320
only applied actually to big sur and

394
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,959
catalina so i'm counting it also in the

395
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,680
everything got patched category

396
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
but obviously there's a lot of

397
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
discrepancies here now these are some of

398
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,279
the most serious vulnerabilities right

399
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,519
these are ones that we know somebody was

400
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,920
actively exploiting

401
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,800
so

402
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
why is there so much disparity among

403
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,760
these actively exploited vulnerabilities

404
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,199
i think we need to explore those further

405
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,920
this is that list of 15 vulnerabilities

406
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,199
as you can see many of these

407
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
vulnerabilities were reported by people

408
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,759
who chose to remain anonymous which

409
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,759
makes it nearly impossible to find out

410
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,600
whether or not some of these may have

411
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,079
only impacted the mac os versions that

412
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,079
were actually patched unless of course

413
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,480
apple tells us but

414
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
you know

415
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,360
uh although for web bit vulnerabilities

416
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,199
in particular it seems like a fairly

417
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,680
safe assumption that they probably apply

418
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,959
to all os versions webkit is a core

419
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,800
framework used throughout the operating

420
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,079
system not just safari so it seems like

421
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,480
apple might want to patch in the wild

422
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
webkit vulnerabilities across all mac os

423
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,720
versions and not just for big sur

424
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
but they're not for some reason at least

425
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,519
in these three cases

426
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,040
but there's another vulnerability on

427
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,440
this list that's made a lot of headlines

428
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
recently

429
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,800
this one here which apple patched two

430
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,079
weeks ago for big sur and catalina did

431
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,360
not get patched for mac os mojave

432
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
but the reason the vulnerability itself

433
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
made headlines was not because it wasn't

434
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
patched from mojave it was that it was

435
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
one of the vulnerabilities used by

436
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,090
the pegasus spyware

437
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,169
[Music]

438
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,720
okay so if you're not familiar with

439
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,920
pegasus

440
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,320
back in july there was a leak of tens of

441
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,880
thousands of high-profile individuals

442
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,199
who were allegedly potential targets of

443
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,839
this mobile phone spyware pegasus has

444
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
been used to target business executives

445
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,160
religious figures academics ngo

446
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,480
employees union officials and government

447
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,319
officials including cabinet ministers

448
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,480
presidents and prime ministers

449
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,439
and

450
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
more than 180 journalists that we know

451
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,720
of

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,799
pegasus often infects devices via

453
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,520
zero-click remote attacks that exploit

454
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,919
zero-day vulnerabilities

455
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
so getting back to that vulnerability

456
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,480
that pegasus leveraged apple didn't

457
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,440
patch it for mac os mojave

458
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
and also it wasn't just a matter of

459
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,840
apple forgetting to document that it was

460
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,600
patched because there was no

461
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
corresponding security update released

462
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,679
for mojave

463
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,880
so then the next question is was mojave

464
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,280
actually affected by this vulnerability

465
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
i asked apple but of course they never

466
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
responded to my inquiry

467
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,280
however one person i reached out to did

468
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,679
mickey jinn is one of the unsung heroes

469
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,919
of the apple security community by my

470
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,440
count he's tied with one other

471
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
researcher for the highest number of

472
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,039
vulnerabilities that apple has credited

473
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,520
to a researcher since big sur's release

474
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,840
44

475
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,880
vulnerabilities mickey recently

476
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
published his own independent analysis

477
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,679
of this pegasus vulnerability so i asked

478
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,120
him if he knew whether mojave was

479
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,480
affected by it

480
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,520
he confirmed that mojave is indeed still

481
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,440
vulnerable

482
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
now i'm not aware of any reports so far

483
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,360
about this vulnerability being used

484
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,240
against desktop computers but now that

485
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,400
multiple independent analyses of this

486
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,320
vulnerability have been published and

487
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
apple has chosen not to fix it for

488
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
mojave it would be very easy for a

489
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
malicious actor to take advantage of the

490
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,280
opportunity

491
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,160
so you might reasonably ask okay okay

492
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,039
but

493
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
are there even a lot of macs that are

494
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,600
still on older operating systems well

495
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,080
you might be surprised although big sur

496
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
and catalina collectively make up about

497
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
78 percent of macs being used online

498
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
today that means that more than

499
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
one-fifth of actively used max

500
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,440
is running mojave or older and that of

501
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
course means that they're vulnerable to

502
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,200
this or other serious vulnerabilities

503
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,559
that may never get patched

504
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,480
okay so at this point you might be

505
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,120
wondering about ios does it have similar

506
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
problems

507
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,360
okay so there's a lot to unpack here but

508
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,640
there's

509
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,160
a bit of a different situation with ios

510
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,600
currently apple is releasing patches for

511
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,320
the newly released ios 15

512
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,360
and

513
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
ios 14 interestingly even though it

514
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
supports the same devices apple is kind

515
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,039
of starting to do i guess the kind of

516
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,880
thing that they have done for many years

517
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
with releasing

518
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,080
support to some degree for the n minus

519
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,919
one version

520
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,280
but also

521
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,159
apple is still patching ios 12 kind of

522
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,919
some older devices first of all are

523
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,640
stuck on ios 12. and this is actually

524
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,480
why i think that apple is still

525
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
releasing some patches for that

526
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
operating system

527
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,919
some of those models include the iphone

528
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,559
5 6 and 6 plus

529
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,799
there were a few ipad models

530
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,720
and you might think uh well i mean do

531
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
people really still use iphones that old

532
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,679
um

533
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,280
yeah

534
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,679
there still are people using old iphones

535
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,720
um and also another really interesting

536
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,039
one that is stuck on ios 12 is the ipod

537
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,760
touch sixth generation

538
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,679
now this model of ipod touch was

539
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,159
actually discontinued only four months

540
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,679
before apple dropped ios 13

541
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,880
which

542
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,280
eliminated support for that model of

543
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,039
ipod touch

544
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,760
so if you had just bought the ipod touch

545
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,840
6th gen like right before the 7th gen

546
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
came out you got 4 months of security

547
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,000
updates for it

548
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,760
ouch

549
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,600
so i think that's probably part of the

550
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,760
reason why apple is still releasing some

551
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,799
limited

552
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,039
updates for ios 12. but that's a key

553
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,760
point there there are limited updates

554
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,640
and based on the patch that apple just

555
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,720
released for ios 12 i think it was last

556
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
week

557
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,240
apple seems to only be attaching the

558
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
actively exploited vulnerabilities in

559
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,280
ios 12. so all the other vulnerabilities

560
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
if apple's not aware of them being

561
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,039
actively exploited they're not going to

562
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,480
patch them for ios 12 so it seems

563
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,440
ios 13's not getting updates anymore ios

564
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,200
14 is supposed to continue getting

565
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,880
updates and now ios 15 is the latest but

566
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
it's missing two actively exploited

567
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,600
patches that are found in ios 14.8

568
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,640
i asked apple again about this and

569
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,520
they didn't respond

570
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
oh yeah so also that little animation

571
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,120
was to remind me that

572
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,440
if you happen to be running ios 14.7

573
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,799
or older um or even if you've got ios

574
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,360
14.8

575
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,960
you're not going to get prompted with a

576
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,679
little badge like this to upgrade to ios

577
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,280
15. i don't know if that's something

578
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,039
that apple is only going to be doing for

579
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,760
a short amount of time but for whatever

580
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,600
reason

581
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,840
i had a device recently that was on ios

582
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,679
14.7

583
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,559
and it did not give me a badge to notify

584
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,280
me that there was ios 14.8 which

585
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,799
patched actively exploited

586
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,799
vulnerabilities and it also didn't give

587
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,480
me a badge to let me know that there was

588
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,760
a brand new shiny ios 15 available

589
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,240
and i checked and it's a lot of devices

590
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,320
actually that are experiencing that so i

591
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
i don't know exactly what apple's plans

592
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,440
are there

593
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,039
um and for more details about what's

594
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,280
going on with ios security updates we

595
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,720
have some recent articles on the mac

596
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,320
security blog that explore ios further

597
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,280
okay so what can we take away from this

598
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,600
generally speaking the current mac os

599
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,919
version is the safest one

600
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,000
sure yeah there have been cases in the

601
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
past where there's been some

602
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,200
vulnerability that apple introduced with

603
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
the new version but generally speaking

604
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
the latest is the safest because it gets

605
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,880
the most total patches and they're the

606
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,360
most important ones apple

607
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,080
has a history of of always fixing those

608
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,840
actively exploited vulnerabilities at

609
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,919
the very least for the current operating

610
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,000
system

611
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,520
so um you probably want to avoid using

612
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,480
the two previous versions of mac os as

613
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,039
your primary mac os like on your main

614
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,679
computer that you use

615
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,240
and it's probably best to

616
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,320
quickly upgrade to the latest mac os

617
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,240
version

618
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
and if you happen to be using

619
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
one of those two previous macos versions

620
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,840
make sure that you don't assume that

621
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,039
just because you're still getting

622
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,120
security updates from apple that you're

623
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,480
necessarily safe from serious

624
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,559
vulnerabilities they may not be getting

625
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,880
patched they may never get patched in

626
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,240
some cases

627
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,000
and if you really need to keep a mac on

628
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
an older version of mac os for a

629
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,400
particular app it probably again

630
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
shouldn't be your main mac maybe keep

631
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,279
that one offline or you know don't use

632
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,279
it as your machine that you use to

633
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,799
browse the internet and things like that

634
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,480
so um

635
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
i know you probably have some questions

636
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,760
you want to know more about some of

637
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,840
these vulnerabilities and what the list

638
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,120
looks like

639
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,039
and so i'm going to be releasing all

640
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,480
that information i'm still kind of

641
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,080
compiling this

642
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,159
but we will be releasing a white paper

643
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,960
soon with additional details um if you

644
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,279
want uh to be notified when that white

645
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,360
paper is available you can sign up

646
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
for a notification at

647
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,240
the mac security blog

648
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,960
blog.intigo.com

649
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,600
you can also follow me or into go on

650
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,640
twitter

651
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,000
to get notifications because we'll

652
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
definitely announce there once the white

653
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,320
paper is available

654
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,640
and next up i really wanted to thank the

655
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,440
researchers who provided feedback i

656
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,960
couldn't have really done this without

657
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
their help because again

658
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,360
apple doesn't really say much

659
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,279
and so these folks

660
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,400
are amazing people who not only are they

661
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
spending their time contributing and

662
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
helping apple to fix major bugs in their

663
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
operating systems

664
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,039
but they also were kind enough to take

665
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,200
the time to uh to respond and help

666
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,279
answer some questions related to this

667
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,080
talk so thank you very much to all of

668
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,039
these

669
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,480
really important folks for their

670
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
invaluable feedback

671
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,080
and finally thank all of you for

672
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,919
listening to this talk and i know

673
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,159
there's a lot of people watching

674
