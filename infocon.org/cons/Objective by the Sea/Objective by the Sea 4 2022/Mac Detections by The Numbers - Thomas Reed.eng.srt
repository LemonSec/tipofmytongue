1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,279
great talk all right next up we have the

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,440
thomas reed i feel like he doesn't need

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,599
much of an introduction uh all of us in

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,440
the space are well over all the great

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,200
work he's doing he's gonna be giving an

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,720
interesting talk of

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,359
um kind of mac malware adware by the

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,359
numbers which is really interesting

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,119
because you know working at malwarebytes

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,560
he has great insight into larger trends

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,480
that some of us as individual security

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,920
researchers might not see so really

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,199
interested in

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,719
thomas's talk

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,960
we missed him last year

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,120
he did speak virtually so super stoked

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,719
though here in person so let's give

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,360
thomas a round of applause

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,280
thank you

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
thank you

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,879
and i i had i was looking at the picture

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,320
from last year

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,879
and i i was wearing the same shirt

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,280
by no by coincidence so

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,039
different hat

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,840
but

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
there was a hat yeah

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
so all right

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,000
so

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
as patrick mentioned today we're going

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,438
to be talking about mac detections by

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,280
the numbers we're not just going to talk

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
about data we're going to talk about

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,360
some threat

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,119
characteristics and stuff like that as

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,200
well um so i'll try and mix it up a

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,720
little bit

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,600
a little bit about myself as as said i

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,240
do work for malwarebytes if you want to

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,920
talk to me about anything you can find

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,360
me on twitter there's my email address

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,880
you know

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,759
all questions all comments anything

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,040
you're you know you're welcome to

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,159
contact me anytime

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,799
so let's just start off with a little

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,400
bit of info

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
about our overall detection so far this

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,799
year

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,200
and you can see it's been

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,799
more or less

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,399
steady sort of between you know 7.5 and

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,439
almost 15 million um you know no

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,159
there's some you know dips and rises in

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,759
there but nothing

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,799
like really huge um

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,200
so uh if we look

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,399
a little bit more at like the um

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,920
geographical distribution of everything

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,400
that we've seen this year you see it's

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
very strongly weighted towards the us um

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,400
you know with the uk and australia and

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
canada and whatnot all following up

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,520
this is pretty much in line with

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,000
our customer base so we have a very

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
strong u.s customer base

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,040
and then we have a lot of folks in

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,319
europe uh you'll notice they're really

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,720
you know there's not a lot actually

70
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,280
there are no countries in that top 10

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,959
that are in the pie chart

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
in asia we don't have a real strong

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,879
presence in asia

74
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,519
you know in particular china uh you know

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,200
our software has trouble getting through

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,599
getting through the great firewall so

77
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,080
it's um we don't have a strong presence

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,879
there so our data there is not as strong

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
so the top things that we have seen this

80
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,239
year and this changes every year it's

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
kind of interesting to watch how this

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
changes i think last year

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,000
the very topmost item was uh pcvark

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
they're they're a potentially unwanted

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,000
program vendor also known by some other

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,319
names like uh in inovus think labs and

87
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
cystweek

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,519
but this year the top was

89
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,799
jdi which i believe stands for just do

90
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,200
it or just develop it

91
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
something like that

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
and they develop

93
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
among other things total av and

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,120
scanguard

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,519
they also

96
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,560
got a little bit more notoriety back you

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
know

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
10 years ago or so with things like

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,080
zip cloud and just cloud and and all

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,959
those kinds of things that were in

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,840
so

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,319
many bundle installers back in the day

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
so they've re they seem to mostly have

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
retired those things you don't see them

105
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
as much anymore but now it's scan guard

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
and total av which are

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,399
you know just clones of each other under

108
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,198
different names

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
and then one little fun fact here about

110
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,919
our detections we had

111
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,639
one detection in antarctica this year

112
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,240
and it was this search ext

113
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
safari extension

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,360
this is a really old safari extension

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,880
you know that that kind of safari

116
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,680
extension doesn't even work anymore

117
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,759
i think this particular adware is

118
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
something that we called conduit which

119
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,639
we also don't see a whole lot of anymore

120
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,919
so it's kind of interesting that this

121
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,280
turned up in antarctica of all places

122
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,680
was it this guy i don't know probably

123
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
not but

124
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,199
it's kind of interesting to you know

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,680
theorize you know what that what might

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,639
have been going on there

127
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,880
so when it comes to

128
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,919
some of the new actual malware so we're

129
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,600
sort of throwing out all the pups and

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
adware for now

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,720
when we're looking at

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,680
what was new this year with the just the

133
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,759
malware

134
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,320
our top detections were a

135
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
generic

136
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,400
sort of a behavioral detection that we

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,420
have in our engine

138
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,639
[Music]

139
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,280
osx.generic.suspicious which is kind of

140
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,880
a generic name on purpose

141
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
there are things from many different

142
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
families of of malware and adware and

143
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
whatnot that fall into this category

144
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
and in general they're all very

145
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,120
suspicious behaviors and so in this case

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
what was added this year what we added

147
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,240
to it

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,680
was there was a new version of v search

149
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,400
also known as pirite or pirate or

150
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,160
however you say it

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,960
in the windows world

152
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
and it added this script called helper

153
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,400
update in the user's bin folder which

154
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,319
i don't think i've ever i don't know i

155
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,759
don't know if anybody else in here has

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,039
ever seen a bin folder in the user

157
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,199
home folder i haven't so

158
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
we we put in a sort of a generic rule

159
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,600
for this because it is kind of

160
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,440
suspicious and all it has in there is

161
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,120
kill all terminal which is pretty

162
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,160
suspicious um

163
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
so that that's one new thing we saw this

164
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,400
year but in the past

165
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
with this one

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
so here are some of the things we've

167
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,840
seen and it's you'll notice here there's

168
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,639
a trend most of the things that we are

169
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
detecting with this are all launch

170
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
agents and demons

171
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,759
so

172
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
we see a whole bunch of these where it's

173
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,639
a launch daemon with this weird like com

174
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,599
dot

175
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,120
uuid

176
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,440
dot plist form

177
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,319
um

178
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
you can scroll through our data and see

179
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,680
just like

180
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
tons and tons and tons of different

181
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,319
uuids

182
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,599
we see a lot of these so it's

183
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,840
a launch daemon again that's named com

184
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,199
dot

185
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,000
two or three words that are randomly

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,880
chosen i believe from a dictionary

187
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,599
with a p at the end dot p list

188
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,720
so we see tons and tons of these coming

189
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,960
through

190
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,759
there's this

191
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,000
folder in application support we see

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,919
tons of these where it's just a dot with

193
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,080
a uuid after it and there's some pretty

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,000
suspicious stuff inside that folder

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,840
lots and lots of other uuids

196
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,599
there and then here

197
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,800
i'm just scrolling through a list

198
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
of items in launch agents that are named

199
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,280
either

200
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,440
com.sumrandomword.plist or dot some

201
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,879
random word dot

202
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,000
and then two random letters dot p list

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,599
and you can see

204
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,479
in this video it just keeps going and

205
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,639
going and going and if we keep watching

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
we won't even get out of the a's

207
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,120
so

208
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,759
you know this is very very prolific lots

209
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,759
and lots and lots and it's it's really

210
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,599
difficult to detect this sort of thing

211
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,160
by by name you know you have to go into

212
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
the content

213
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
um

214
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
before we talk a little bit about the

215
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
data just what exactly is suspicious

216
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,159
about these things

217
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,039
um

218
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,839
in a lot of cases it's something like

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,039
piping

220
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,919
something from curl into bash or

221
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,320
taking some weird um you know base64

222
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
encoded

223
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
chunk of text

224
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,519
passing that through base64 and then

225
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,120
piping that into python or you know a

226
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
number of other things like this that

227
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,959
really shouldn't be going on inside of a

228
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,800
launch agent or daemon p list

229
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
and so here on the data what you'll see

230
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
is we've actually seen a bit of a

231
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,360
decline in this over the course of the

232
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,720
year now that decline is kind of

233
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,040
relative because we still are seeing

234
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
a lot of this

235
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,040
but but it's definitely not as much

236
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,959
recently as we were seeing towards the

237
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,760
beginning of the year

238
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,320
and where do we see all this kind of

239
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
stuff so most of it again is in the

240
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
united states which is kind of in you

241
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,279
know

242
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,880
expected because that's where our

243
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
customer base mostly is

244
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
um but in this case there's a little bit

245
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
of a difference in that you know with

246
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,160
with our

247
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,240
global detections there was a small

248
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
little i think it was like eight percent

249
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,880
was in the other category and here 25

250
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,360
percent is in that other category so we

251
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
see a lot more of this in some of those

252
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,160
more you know less

253
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,360
the countries that we have less

254
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,399
representation in so for example asia

255
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,040
so let's take a look at dub robber this

256
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,920
is one also known as um xcs set um this

257
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,399
is one that came out this year uh it

258
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,720
came out in january i believe

259
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
uh or i'm sorry actually this one came

260
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,959
out last year but jamf

261
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,360
and we have some representation in here

262
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,320
discovered a new zero day

263
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,760
uh in in a new variant of of this

264
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,360
malware

265
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,079
so we had some new samples to play with

266
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,160
and that's why it's in here it was

267
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,000
discovered last year but there was some

268
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
new stuff

269
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,560
and this malware uses a lot of run-only

270
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
apple scripts which are

271
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,120
pain in the butt to figure out what

272
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,399
exactly they're doing

273
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,880
um you know it's there's no easy way to

274
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,920
decompile these things uh i know phil

275
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,320
stokes has some information about it on

276
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
his blog but um

277
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
on sentinel one but

278
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,399
it's it's still

279
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,480
even with all the tips that he gives

280
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,560
it's really difficult to to crack into

281
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
these run-only apple scripts so i mean

282
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
there's a reason the bad guys are using

283
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,519
those these days and this this isn't the

284
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,800
only malware that does that

285
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
so

286
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,079
as you can see here we saw a pretty high

287
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,079
spike in dub robber right around the

288
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,000
time that it

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,120
this new variant was discovered

290
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
and then it fell back off again pretty

291
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
quickly so you know that's usually

292
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
because

293
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
um

294
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,839
that particular variant there were a lot

295
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,680
of machines that were infected by it and

296
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,480
then

297
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
once they were sort of cleaned up

298
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
there aren't there you know we were past

299
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,240
the point where it was still being

300
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,880
distributed

301
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
this one we do not see our normal you

302
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,040
know like this is not our customer our

303
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,680
normal customer base that's strongly us

304
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,519
this was 50 percent

305
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,040
pakistan

306
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
um then india and then the united states

307
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,079
was only six percent so

308
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,760
this one was more strong in um

309
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,519
in the middle east um also there's some

310
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,920
you know japan is on the list hong kong

311
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
china so it's stronger in asia as well

312
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,360
rather than in the us and europe

313
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
electro rat was another one from this

314
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
year this one was discovered january 5th

315
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,720
so very early on in the year and it was

316
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,680
a fake cryptocurrency trading app that

317
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,600
was really signed to steal your

318
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,120
cryptocurrency

319
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,040
and it dropped some files on the system

320
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,399
that were designed to look like

321
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,240
spotlight related files you know

322
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,320
that's a pretty common thing that we see

323
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,279
on mac os as i'm sure most of you guys

324
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,839
who deal with malware know

325
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,040
and there were all kinds of other

326
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,200
support files that it dropped as well

327
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,959
so electrorat

328
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,120
we really haven't seen a whole lot of it

329
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,600
we've seen a total of four

330
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
cases

331
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,639
and all of them were in the united

332
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,200
states so

333
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
and as you can see we haven't seen it

334
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
since april

335
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,880
so this one i don't know why it's so

336
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,279
small it's possible that it really was

337
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,440
never widely distributed

338
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,600
or it's possible that

339
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
we just saw the cases that were in the

340
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,279
u.s and we didn't really you know maybe

341
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,800
it was more strongly distributed

342
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
somewhere else that we don't have

343
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
a strong customer base we just don't

344
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,519
know

345
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,839
osa minor was one that was found in

346
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,279
january 11th and it also

347
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,440
like uh dub robber xcset it also uses

348
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,240
some run-only apple scripts

349
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,959
and it actually had this this trick

350
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,040
where it went to this website shown in

351
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,440
the screenshot from the sentinel one

352
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,959
website

353
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,079
and it downloaded a minor script that

354
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,120
was disguised as a png file but that png

355
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,959
file was actually a run only apple

356
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,040
script

357
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,440
and and so that was kind of you know you

358
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,279
don't see that kind of stuff with mac

359
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,839
malware as often you know usually it's

360
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
very straightforward so disguising this

361
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,800
as a png and downloading it was

362
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,320
sneakier than we usually see on mac os

363
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
this one we did see you know we've been

364
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
seeing some fairly

365
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,079
constant

366
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,720
detections at a fairly low level

367
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
they peaked a little higher back around

368
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,720
the time that it was new

369
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
but as you can see we're still seeing so

370
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
a few here and there every month

371
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,040
but not huge numbers at all by any means

372
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,000
and this one was very strong in china

373
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,680
but also had representation in the

374
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,760
united states fairly strongly so um

375
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,279
you know but you'll see

376
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,680
there are a lot of other like in

377
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
addition to china there's hong kong

378
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,279
taiwan

379
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,560
thailand

380
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,199
so there was there were a lot of other

381
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,279
asian countries that were on the list

382
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,240
here so this one was very strong in asia

383
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
silver sparrow tony talked about this

384
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,199
one um i think that that was earlier

385
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,880
today right yeah

386
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,199
um it's starting to lose track of which

387
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,839
talks were what day but

388
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,720
um

389
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,040
so this one as tony mentioned it was

390
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,600
distributed through a um

391
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,920
you know a file inside the pkg file the

392
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
distribution file which ran a javascript

393
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,680
that dropped all the executables

394
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
and this one

395
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
had the infamous

396
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,519
dot underscore in su file

397
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,240
and this caused a lot of stir because

398
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,199
you know

399
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,040
if that file was present the malware

400
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,440
would uninstall itself but nobody really

401
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,720
knew

402
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
what that file looked like

403
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,800
nobody knew

404
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,920
you know where it came from

405
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,880
we got some data on detections of the

406
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,839
dot

407
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,519
insu file and got some you know hashes

408
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,560
of it

409
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,199
all exactly the same hash and if you

410
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,600
hash an empty file you get the same hash

411
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,279
so they were it's just a completely

412
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,279
empty file

413
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,839
still have no idea where it was coming

414
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,480
from you know there are many theories

415
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,839
you know like maybe the malware had

416
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,000
run its course and the operators had

417
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,639
decided to self-delete so they had it

418
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,920
deploy this file and self-delete

419
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,079
could be that it was from something else

420
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,519
we just we don't know

421
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,360
and there was a lot of controversy about

422
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,000
that file so we were initially detecting

423
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
that.ensue file because we wanted some

424
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,680
intelligence about it we wanted to know

425
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,000
what was in it and you know we found out

426
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,759
pretty quickly that it was just an empty

427
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,120
file

428
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
um and you can see her numbers there

429
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,920
were pretty high um and these included

430
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,320
those.insu files

431
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
now after a while we decided you know

432
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,639
this isn't really this isn't a malicious

433
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,400
file it's just an empty file we should

434
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
probably stop detecting it

435
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
plus there were some people that were

436
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,119
actually using it as a means of

437
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,520
preventing the infection so they would

438
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,760
actually put the dot into file on their

439
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,959
hard drive

440
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,760
to

441
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,319
keep themselves from getting infected

442
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,919
and we were like well yeah we don't want

443
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,160
to mess with that so we stopped

444
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,919
detecting and you can see that it

445
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,240
dropped off right away

446
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,480
now what you can't see in this data is

447
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
you know

448
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
that what's hidden in that that mountain

449
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
there you know how much of that is the

450
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,080
insu file how much is everything else so

451
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
how much did it actually drop

452
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,080
so

453
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,840
i filtered the data i got up this

454
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
morning and actually did this

455
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,160
i was inspired after talking to tony

456
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
yesterday

457
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
this is what it looked like without

458
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,000
those ensue file detections and so you

459
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,679
can see there was definitely a spike

460
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,799
back in february but it was not nearly

461
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,039
as high without the dot ensue files

462
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,720
so

463
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,640
that's what the actual data looked like

464
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
without

465
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,280
the without the empty files

466
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
and this one was

467
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,960
very predominantly in the united states

468
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,360
this one you know if

469
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,039
it's you can't memorize all the pie

470
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,280
charts but if you if you compare this to

471
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
our global

472
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,600
the pie chart of our global distribution

473
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
of everything we've detected this year

474
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,480
it's very very similar to that so

475
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
this one was pretty much you know

476
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,640
distributed within

477
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,440
you know

478
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,679
sort of uniformly within our customer

479
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,000
base

480
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,440
electrum stealer uh this one was one

481
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
that showed up in february and it was a

482
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,000
fake version of electro electrum um

483
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,919
again this was you know designed to

484
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,080
steal your cryptocurrency

485
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
there were a whole bunch of reddit

486
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
threads about this and that's they they

487
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
were outing this this app as being a

488
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,320
fake

489
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,160
and it really wasn't anything fancy it

490
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,000
was just the app it didn't install any

491
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,080
kind of persistence method

492
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,679
didn't install anything else on the hard

493
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,919
drive it was just the app

494
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,320
but i mean for its goal stealing your

495
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,480
cryptocurrency that's all it needs right

496
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
this one actually

497
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
we have never

498
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,320
seen an actual detection in the wild

499
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,799
no idea why you know it could be that

500
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,039
it's outside of our user base you know

501
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,600
maybe it's stronger in china and

502
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,520
not that widespread in china so we

503
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,600
haven't seen it

504
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
maybe it's

505
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,600
you know just very very rare we just

506
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
don't know but we've never seen it

507
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,639
before in the wild

508
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,840
xcode spy was another really interesting

509
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,559
one that came out in march this one

510
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,520
actually

511
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,480
was delivered through compromised xcode

512
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
projects and so

513
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,120
what the the bad guys did here is they

514
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,360
added a very obfuscated script to an

515
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,159
xcode project that would run as soon as

516
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,840
you built and ran the project

517
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,559
and they were distributing this so

518
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,159
you know obviously the intent here is to

519
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,440
infect

520
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,240
target develop targeted developers who

521
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,840
are using xcode

522
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,960
um

523
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,000
and what it would do is it would

524
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,679
actually install an eggshell back door

525
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,360
eggshell if you're not familiar with it

526
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,200
is an open source

527
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
backdoor

528
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,480
i think it's still up on github um

529
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,159
and so you know if you're interested in

530
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,159
seeing what it does you could you can go

531
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,400
download it if it's not not on github

532
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,799
anymore i haven't looked in a while

533
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,600
i'm sure you could find it somewhere so

534
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,760
but obviously the intent here was to

535
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,679
infect these developers get a back door

536
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,440
in their system and then

537
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,720
who knows what you know steal

538
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,880
credentials

539
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,360
maybe get a supply chain attack in place

540
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,679
you know who knows

541
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,159
this one again

542
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,000
we've not seen any detections of this

543
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,320
one ever now part of that might be

544
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,559
because it is

545
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,760
believed to be north korean in origin so

546
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
that's definitely outside our user base

547
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,040
we have nothing in north korea

548
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,679
[Music]

549
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,840
it's also possible if it's north korean

550
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,159
in origin that it might be used in very

551
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
targeted attacks

552
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,520
and those can be very difficult to pick

553
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,360
up you know if you're not if you don't

554
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
have malwarebytes installed

555
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,400
we can't pick it up and you know

556
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,679
there are plenty of people that could be

557
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,600
targeted that wouldn't have it installed

558
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,880
so this is

559
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,120
probably mostly outside our user base

560
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
and maybe

561
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,480
only used in a very small number of

562
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,679
cases

563
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,919
so

564
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,280
wild python now this is one actually you

565
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,679
know we call it wild python

566
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,520
it was discovered by

567
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,280
kaspersky they called it wild pressure

568
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,200
we didn't choose to call it wild

569
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
pressure because that was the name of

570
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,120
the threat group

571
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,360
rather than the malware itself so we

572
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,799
wanted to kind of

573
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,919
you know name it a little bit

574
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,480
differently than the threat group i see

575
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,520
tony back there

576
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,120
so we named it wild python just so that

577
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,720
you know you know if you ever see that

578
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,679
in our detections or anything like that

579
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,840
we have no idea what the dropper was and

580
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,400
i actually contacted the guy who

581
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,799
wrote did the write up for kaspersky and

582
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,200
he hadn't seen it either

583
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,640
so

584
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,520
there was a guard.py

585
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,080
file a python file that dropped

586
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,799
everything and it had both windows and

587
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,919
mac

588
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,320
code in it so it was capable of

589
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
infecting either a windows or a mac

590
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
machine

591
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,240
there may have been a pie installer

592
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,080
build that could was capable of

593
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,280
infecting mac os we don't really know

594
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,080
by itself just a python file isn't

595
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,679
really that's that's not the

596
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,760
transmission vector that's going to be

597
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,679
as like a second stage or something like

598
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,960
that we have no idea what the first

599
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,880
stage was

600
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,039
and so we kind of wonder

601
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,120
is this actually even in the wild for

602
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,600
mac or was it that they they somebody

603
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,520
built this script and wrote it for both

604
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
mac and windows in case they wanted that

605
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,360
but they never actually deployed it for

606
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,280
mac

607
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,440
we don't know but we've seen

608
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
no detections of this again ever

609
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,760
[Music]

610
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,000
technically we did see six detections

611
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,240
but i was able to determine that those

612
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,120
all were coming from someone testing

613
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,080
um

614
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,240
with our with our app to see if if it

615
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,000
was detected

616
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,840
and this was like right after the

617
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
write-up was published just to you know

618
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,600
see if we were detecting it

619
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,840
uh there was there was something in the

620
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,520
data that i could see that i could

621
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,919
identify um and that was mainly because

622
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,840
you know it's somebody that um

623
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,679
i was familiar with

624
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,679
so yeah i wouldn't have been able to

625
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,400
tell except for that so

626
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
um

627
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,840
and this uh

628
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,360
you know it was believed that this was

629
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,720
kind of you know

630
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,799
targeting the middle east you and also

631
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,520
targeted attacks um so again this is

632
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,440
probably mostly outside of our user base

633
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,039
because we don't have a strong user base

634
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,840
in the middle east

635
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,840
but you know again we really don't know

636
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,000
if this is even in the wild for mac or

637
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,960
just for windows

638
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,640
xloader is another recent one this was

639
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,559
in july and it was built in java

640
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,880
so let that sink in for just a minute

641
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,000
when's the last time that a mac had java

642
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
installed

643
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,679
it's been a long time they ripped that

644
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,440
out a long time ago

645
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,360
not only was it java but of course it

646
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,679
was not signed

647
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,039
so like

648
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,960
how do you know how is the average user

649
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,720
going to use this to infect themselves

650
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,640
you know it's

651
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,159
it's really unrealistic and then of

652
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,000
course you run it

653
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
and it's very common as i'm sure all of

654
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,039
you know for for you know these apps

655
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,080
that act like a document to open some

656
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,840
kind of a decoy document while they're

657
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,679
doing their bad stuff in the background

658
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,640
right

659
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
we see that all the time

660
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,799
so

661
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,200
it opened a decoy document but the decoy

662
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,039
document was just a png file of the

663
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,880
microsoft word icon

664
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
so

665
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,200
not exactly a very convincing decoy

666
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,480
document

667
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,640
and kind of you kind of wonder where the

668
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,520
where the requirements went wrong on

669
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,679
that one like hey can you open a decoy

670
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,200
document

671
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,840
make it make it microsoft word

672
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,240
somebody decided to use the icon instead

673
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
so

674
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
and it was designed to harvest

675
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,240
credentials among other things um you

676
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,799
know there there was a lot in there that

677
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,919
that we still really didn't know

678
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,840
everything that it was capable of doing

679
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,520
um but yeah you know i mean this just

680
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,080
was not very realistic malware you know

681
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,799
as a as a java file and and being

682
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,640
unsigned and

683
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,679
as you might expect from that again no

684
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,120
detections ever

685
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,240
except for four false positives

686
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,120
so

687
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,960
we don't know if this is actually truly

688
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,320
in the wild

689
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,080
maybe there's incomplete intel so

690
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,200
there's something out there that we're

691
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,919
not aware of

692
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,000
and then finally zuru which

693
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,159
patrick

694
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,700
did the first write up for

695
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,320
[Music]

696
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,760
well first right up within the u.s

697
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,600
there was a chinese blog about it as

698
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,880
well but most people didn't see that

699
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,279
and um this was a

700
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,200
not really a supply chain attack it was

701
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,400
just it was trojanized apps you know the

702
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,260
the one that was first known was item 2

703
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,480
[Music]

704
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
and so you run the app and it drops

705
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,440
these two files in the temp folder

706
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,240
g.p.y and something called google update

707
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,640
and g.p.y

708
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,399
was very easy to read you could read

709
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,760
through and see everything it was doing

710
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,840
and basically it was harvesting a whole

711
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,399
bunch of data related to credentials and

712
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,320
other things like that

713
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,600
and then the google update was a mock o

714
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,520
binary

715
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,880
and it was a um

716
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,440
it was basically a back door and so you

717
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,520
know you get the idea here this is

718
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,279
harvesting credentials and then looking

719
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,600
to move laterally

720
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,320
so

721
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,360
potentially something very targeted

722
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,679
now we have seen a couple detections of

723
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,240
this so far since it was discovered it

724
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,159
hasn't been that long since the

725
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,080
discovery so there might be some new

726
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,360
data that will come up at some point

727
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,039
but in this case

728
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,760
it was all it was on the same machine

729
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,880
so one detection on september 17th and

730
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
then another one of the same file on the

731
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,480
18th

732
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,360
and it was the navicat premium app which

733
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
had been trojanized

734
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,720
and this detection was in thailand so

735
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,279
not sure exactly why why it was detected

736
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,279
two days in a row it could be that the

737
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,360
first day maybe the user was like no i

738
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
don't you know that's legit i'm not

739
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,480
going to quarantine that that's got to

740
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,159
be a false positive and then the next

741
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,279
day they

742
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,679
let it be quarantined

743
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,240
or it's possible that you know they

744
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,520
skipped

745
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,120
quarantining at the first day and then

746
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,720
when it was detected the second day they

747
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,039
were went in and added an exclusion for

748
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,480
it so it's still on their system

749
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
potentially

750
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,880
don't don't really know but

751
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
yeah it's

752
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,679
we may

753
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,919
see more out of this one in the future

754
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,120
but

755
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,600
it looks like it might be outside of our

756
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,640
our user base again because it is

757
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,240
there were a lot of indicators here that

758
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,399
it was in china and other asian

759
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,399
countries

760
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,799
which is kind of outside of our our area

761
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,200
so uh i did this uh after apple released

762
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,919
numbers 11.2 with the support for these

763
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,240
radar charts so of course i had to nerd

764
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
out and go and add one

765
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,960
so this shows the distributions of

766
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,760
silver sparrow and dub robber or xcs set

767
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,200
you can see that

768
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,520
dub robber was mainly middle east and

769
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,000
asia as we mentioned

770
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,279
and

771
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,960
silver sparrow was really mainly north

772
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,559
american europe and you know it's kind

773
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,559
of interesting to see how it

774
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,039
how those distributions look on the

775
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,080
chart

776
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,840
all the others that we talked about

777
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,520
they'd be like a little fraction of a

778
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,600
pixel down there around the zero axis so

779
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
not a lot of detections and in some

780
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
cases in a lot of cases no detections

781
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,039
for a lot of those other things

782
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,080
any questions and and if you want the

783
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,559
slides you can i promise i'm not rick

784
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,240
rolling you or something like that that

785
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,000
really is the right link

786
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,120
yeah so um but yeah any questions

787
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,799
yeah so the distributions are

788
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,960
interesting how would you say

789
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,440
they break down in terms of you know you

790
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,960
see some malware that's written probably

791
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,799
for chinese targets that's gonna be more

792
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,600
in china right or is it that it was just

793
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
written in china it's distributed there

794
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,360
so it's kind of the authorship versus

795
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,679
the targeting is it one versus

796
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,240
yeah it's hard to tell um

797
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,480
you know especially with uh the asian

798
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,480
countries because we don't have a lot of

799
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,240
representation there

800
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,200
but yeah generally what we see is you

801
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,440
know if something is coming from a

802
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,480
chinese or you know asian threat actor

803
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,679
you know whether it's ocean lotus

804
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,159
you know from vietnam or whether it's

805
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,200
something

806
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,679
from north korea or whatever

807
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,559
it generally tends to be used in those

808
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,720
same regions maybe not in the same

809
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,880
country but in the same

810
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,720
general region

811
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
so we often don't see a lot of those

812
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,799
things you know we don't see much ocean

813
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,200
lotus we don't see much of

814
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,240
you know

815
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,760
any of the north korean stuff

816
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,360
so also

817
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,039
yeah

818
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,200
it seems to with the middle east as well

819
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,640
it seems to hold true with the middle

820
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,519
east

821
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,000
as well as far as we can tell now i'm

822
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,600
sure there are some

823
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,960
you know there there

824
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,039
are going to be some some cases where

825
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,600
they're targeting maybe some

826
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,960
um you know

827
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,880
activist here in the united states

828
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
that's speaking out against

829
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,000
um

830
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,080
you know a country in the middle east

831
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,600
but

832
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,279
yeah for the most part it seems to stay

833
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,120
within those regions from what we've

834
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
seen now i don't i don't know what other

835
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,679
people have seen so

836
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,200
other people might have different data

837
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,240
oh the question uh for those at home

838
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
what's the breakdown for enterprise

839
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,080
versus home users

840
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,360
um

841
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,080
i didn't crunch a lot of data on that we

842
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,399
will do that um at the end of the year

843
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,480
when we do our state of the uh of

844
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,159
malware report

845
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,080
but in general

846
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,080
we tend to see a lot more detections on

847
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,399
a consumer we have a lot larger consumer

848
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,480
customer base uh and last year

849
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,799
there was a difference

850
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,600
in what was detected out in enterprise

851
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,399
versus um consumer

852
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,080
and it was it was

853
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,679
not something you would expect you'd

854
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,080
expect some of the more malicious nasty

855
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,880
stuff to be targeting enterprise um

856
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,120
and what we saw if i'm remembering right

857
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,159
was that

858
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,679
there's a really high number of pups

859
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,360
in enterprise versus more adware in the

860
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
consumer space

861
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
so

862
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,240
we'll see that that might hold true

863
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,960
again this year

864
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,960
and yeah any

865
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,919
predictions for next year

866
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,679
it has been a really quiet year so far

867
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,840
this year um you know obviously we've

868
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,000
seen some things you know we talked

869
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
about you know all this malware that's

870
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
dropped this year

871
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,600
but um

872
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,000
yeah hopefully hopefully i'm not jinxing

873
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,679
us but um

874
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,720
yeah it's been it's been quiet this year

875
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
but it does it tends to come in waves

876
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
that's what i've learned about you know

877
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,760
over years of watching the the the mac

878
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,840
threat landscape is it'll it'll be quiet

879
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,200
for a while

880
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,399
and then right when you're starting to

881
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,399
get comfortable and you're like oh yeah

882
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,399
things are things are good and then all

883
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,919
of a sudden it's like oh my god i've got

884
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,800
to analyze three new mac samples you

885
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,719
know three new mac pieces of malware

886
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,520
this week and write three blog posts and

887
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,119
yeah it's

888
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,280
um

889
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,399
it's crazy but i do expect one thing

890
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,359
that we see very consistently across

891
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,040
years is that

892
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,520
on mac os the level of the truly

893
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,918
malicious stuff all the nation state

894
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,679
stuff all of the

895
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,760
you know the miners and the

896
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,560
cryptocurrency steelers and all this

897
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,159
malicious stuff that's a fairly low

898
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,440
background

899
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,560
level

900
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,000
compared to all the pups and the adware

901
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,320
that's really where the tremaine traffic

902
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,399
is on mac os

903
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,918
um you know

904
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,918
that's that's what the dangers are to

905
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,159
the average mac user

906
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,280
and

907
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,119
you know i i talk about the malware as

908
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,880
being really nasty and and malicious

909
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,640
but you know don't mess around with the

910
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,560
adware you know if

911
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,839
we've seen

912
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,560
that some of the adware folks are

913
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,880
producing things that are far more

914
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,400
sophisticated

915
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,520
than what we see out of nation state

916
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,079
malware

917
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,800
for mac os you know it's it's crazy

918
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,240
all about the money

919
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,960
cool all right

920
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,640
thank you

921
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,538
[Applause]
