we are really stoked to have ava talking

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,519

all right ava you're on everything looks

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,599

let us begin

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
so hi everybody uh my name is eva

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,960
galperin and welcome to hey siri find my

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,199
ex tech enabled abuse in the apple

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,279
ecosystem

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,920
you may be wondering who i am unless you

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,760
already heard patrick's very kind

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,159
introduction i am the director of cyber

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,600
security at the electronic frontier

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,360
foundation i also co-founded the

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,399
coalition against stalkerware uh you can

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,280

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,000
at evaside

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
so let's go ahead and get started and

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,360
the most important thing that we that we

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,120
need to talk about is

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,920
so what is tech-enabled intimate partner

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,120
abuse

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,719
um so as most as more and more of our

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,720
lives become digital uh abuse has really

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,280
uh moved online

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
it is now extremely common for us to

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,600
keep uh

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,520
most of our lives in some sort of uh of

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,720
digital device so your uh your calendar

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,680
is online your photos are online your

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,439
messages are are in some device uh your

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,600
social media uh

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
accounts and more importantly your

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,439
location because uh now that we all

36
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,840
carry cell phones around uh we are all

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
essentially carrying

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,479
location devices in in our back pockets

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,840
at all times and this is information

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,960
which is extremely tempting

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,000
for

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,320
governments to go after which is one of

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,880
the reasons why we've spent so much time

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
for example talking about pegasus and

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,719
for exactly the same reason that this

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,320
information is tempting for uh for

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,680
governments it is also tempting for

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,319
abusers

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,280
the

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
primary method

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,319
in

52
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,560
use that um

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,040
that abusers have used in order to sort

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,760
of

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
keep

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,879
on their on their survivors and targets

57
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,400
victims

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,440
is

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,200
a class of software called stalkerware

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,840
stockerware is a class of software that

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,680
enables someone to secretly spy on

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
another person's private life via their

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,560
devices

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,319
the abuser can remotely monitor the

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,160
whole device including web searches

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,040
geolocation text messages photos voice

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
calls and much more

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,120
these programs are easy to buy and

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,200
install and

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
they are commercially available

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
the primary

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,720
marker of of stalkerware

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
is that it runs hidden in the background

74
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,440
without the affected person knowing or

75
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
giving their consent

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
uh it is very easy to find these

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,400
products for example this is a google

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,440
search for spy on my partner's iphone

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
the iphone is not some sort of magical

80
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,760
device that is

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,519
immune to

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,519
these kinds of

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,720
of attacks

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,959
so your

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,519
not particularly technically adept

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,560
abuser starts with a google search the

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
google search provides them with links

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,440
to a variety of products

89
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,120
and here is what they go on and do

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,879
so first

91
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,879
the abuser purchases the license for

92
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,120
this doctor where

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,920
then they entered the target's apple id

94
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,720
and password into the stalker

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,840
website uh one of the um

96
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,760
one of the things that actually made it

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
really difficult to convince av

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
companies at first to

99
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
recognize stalkerware as malicious was

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
they said well in order to to use these

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,439
products you need to have the person's

102
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,400
apple id and password and if you have

103
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
their apple id and their password then

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
that is essentially legitimate access to

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
uh to the user's device they should be

106
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,720
able to get this information anyway why

107
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,479
should we label this software as

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,199
malicious and i have news for them about

109
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
how abuse works it's actually extremely

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,680
common for abusers to have their

111
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,240
their targets apple id and password

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,160
because they're able to coerce it out of

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
them

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
then the stock award company uses these

115
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
credentials to log into the targets

116
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,720
account and it downloads data from the

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,759
icloud backups of devices

118
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,919
and finally the abuser logs into the

119
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
stock aware web portal

120
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,280
to view the data which is updated with

121
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,719
every icloud backup

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,919
so

123
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,919
apple knows about all of this and in an

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,240
effort to combat breached icloud

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,199
accounts

126
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
apple has made a bunch of security

127
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,560
improvements to their services over the

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,400
years which helped make icloud more

129
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,199
secure the first thing that they did was

130
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,039
they added to 2fa to apple id

131
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,600
first it was introduced and

132
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,639
now it is the default setting for apple

133
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
ids this is an effective mitigation

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,199
against abusers who do not have physical

135
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,039
access to the targets phone but it's

136
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,120
less helpful for survivors who still

137
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
live with or share space with their

138
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,600
abusers apple has more recently put in

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
place restrictions relating to icloud

140
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,360
this makes it much more difficult for

141
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,199
external devices such as spyware to

142
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,360
retrieve backup data from icloud whether

143
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,639
the account has two-factor

144
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
authentication or not

145
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,840
so how effective are the icloud

146
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,919
mitigations uh certo i a uh security

147
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,240
research company which is also a member

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,560
of the coalition against stalkerware uh

149
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,520
took a look at the top 25 stalkerware

150
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,319
apps and in their report they wrote that

151
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,400
of those 25 apps uh only three uh offer

152
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,120
an icloud solution that could allegedly

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
get all the data from an icloud backup

154
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,560
of an iphone

155
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,039
they tested icloud products uh from

156
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
these three spyware providers with an

157
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,759
apple id that had two factors turned on

158
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,919
as well as another apple id that didn't

159
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,919
and none of the products were able to

160
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,319
retrieve data from the backup in their

161
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,120
test icloud accounts but

162
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
what about partial data

163
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
uh of the original 25 uh another seven

164
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,759
spyware providers claim to be able to

165
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,520
steal data from icloud but in a more

166
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,560
limited way uh so rather than acquiring

167
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,199
a full backup uh they were claiming that

168
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
they were able to download uh

169
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
download data that had been synced with

170
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,199
icloud however and that can include

171
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,400
things like imessages contacts photos

172
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
real-time location

173
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,840
certo

174
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,400
tested all seven of these services with

175
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,199
their test apple ids only two of them

176
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,800
could successfully download the synced

177
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,960
data from icloud the other five failed

178
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
to establish a connection to apple's

179
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,479
servers regardless of whether the

180
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,280
account had two-factor authentication or

181
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,400
not

182
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
so basically most of these services

183
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,680
don't work a lot of them still advertise

184
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
themselves as working and if you look

185
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
through the reviews you can see

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,400
a lot of complaints

187
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,240
so does that mean that the problem of

188
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
stalker wear on the iphone has been

189
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,400
solved completely and the answer is

190
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
no

191
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,639
so this is web watcher uh webwatcher

192
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,360
uses a feature uh called itunes wi-fi

193
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,160
sync which is a built-in ios feature

194
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
used to backup an iphone to a user's

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,080
computer on the same network as opposed

196
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
to having to use a usb

197
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
this feature is used by web watcher as a

198
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,639
way to retrieve data from the phone onto

199
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,720
a computer on the same network

200
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,560
this can be the attacker's computer or

201
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
the victim's own computer

202
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
in addition the hacker can set up a

203
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
feature that will cause the iphone to

204
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,599
automatically back up all of its data to

205
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
the computer every time the phone is

206
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
synced via the network usually this is

207
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,039
overnight when it's connected to the

208
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,479
wi-fi

209
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,000
does it work

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,199
sort of

211
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,479
web watcher reviews are full of

212
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,160
complaints about the limitations of this

213
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,919
product including the lack of real-time

214
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,159
data unless you're on the same network

215
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,320
uh so that's great

216
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,599
however it is very useful for an

217
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,120
attacker that that lives with their

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,720
target because uh the target is coming

219
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,959
back to uh to the same place as uh as

220
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,080
their abuser and they are often using

221
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
the same network i indeed they are using

222
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
it overnight which makes web watcher

223
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
perfect for this particular type of

224
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,279
scenario

225
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,160
the other sort of downside of web

226
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
watcher is that it's very easy to detect

227
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
because all you need to do is check to

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,680
see if the itunes wi-fi sync is turned

229
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,920
on

230
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
so it turns out most methods of spying

231
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
on ios devices these days are detectable

232
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,560
through a thorough review advice and

233
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,040
account settings and

234
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,399
to this end apple has written a really

235
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,920
fantastic manual

236
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,640
with the world's most boring name

237
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,519
it is called device and data access when

238
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
personal safety is at risk and i've put

239
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,680
the url up here and let me tell you i

240
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,720
have a huge crush on this manual

241
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,959
this manual has everything it has

242
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,800
reviews of account settings it has

243
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
reviews of device settings it includes a

244
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,480
discussion of the apple watch it has

245
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,040
screenshots it has checklists this is

246
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,200
everything that i could ever want and i

247
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,920
constantly point uh people who are

248
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,320
concerned about their

249
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,519
um

250
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,160
about their phones and their their apple

251
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,079
devices and their

252
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,640
uh apple ids to

253
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
this particular manual it's really easy

254
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,240
to go through i think it's something

255
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
like 18 pages and you can do the whole

256
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
review

257
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,279
relatively quickly

258
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,839
so everything is great in apple land

259
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,079
uh until a couple months ago when apple

260
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,279
put out a new personal tracker called

261
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
so tracking and monitoring a person's

262
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,880
location without their consent is is

263
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,000
really

264
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,600
it's not new

265
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
uh apple did not in fact just invent

266
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,560
stalking uh

267
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
non-consensual tracking existed even

268
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,040
before the internet uh it's just a lot

269
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,880
easier now thanks to the internet of

270
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,959
things and our increasingly digital

271
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,640
lives because again we are carrying

272
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,800
tracking devices around in our pockets

273
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,160
and when those tracking devices fail uh

274
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,279
now we suddenly have these uh these

275
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,040
nifty little iot devices uh that track

276
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,800
our our entire digital lives

277
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,000
so the appeal of a product like the air

278
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,480
tag is that it's designed to make it

279
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,720
easier to keep track of things that you

280
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,399
have lost so the air tag

281
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,720
is something that you attach to say your

282
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,480
keys or that you stick in your wallet or

283
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,040
a bag and when

284
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,240
you then pair it to uh to your phone

285
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,519
they communicate over bluetooth and when

286
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
you have uh

287
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,720
moved your keys or your bag or your

288
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,040
wallet uh a certain distance from your

289
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
uh from your phone you will get a

290
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,040
message and furthermore if you are

291
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,000
looking for your keys or your bag

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,839
you can simply call up siri and you can

293
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,920
say hey siri find my keys and it will

294
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
give you a location if you are within

295
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
bluetooth range if you're not within

296
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,040
bluetooth range we will talk uh about

297
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,680
that a little bit further down the line

298
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,160
so this is a wonderful way of keeping

299
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,360
track of your lost stuff

300
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,320
unfortunately the flip side of this is

301
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,720
uh is a problem uh the

302
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,880
you cannot build a device that will

303
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,959
track people who have stolen an item

304
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,600
without alerting them

305
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,040
without alerting them without also

306
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
building a tracking device that aids

307
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,360
domestic abusers and stalkers and that's

308
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
why these devices are usually not

309
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,160
marketed for this purpose so basically

310
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,240
you have created something that helps

311
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,360
you find lost stuff and that's great um

312
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,000
but once you create something that helps

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
you find stolen stuff then essentially

314
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,079
you have also created a perfect stocking

315
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,320
device

316
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,959
so let's talk a little bit about

317
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,119
the the greater impacts here

318
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,480
the

319
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,760
advent of the air tag means that there

320
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,560
is

321
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,120
increased access and increased awareness

322
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,000
of this sort of non-consensual tracking

323
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,959
i it also means that there are more

324
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,200
unaware of victims there are people who

325
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
you know do not yet know how uh what

326
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,279
these things are or how they work and

327
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,399
they don't know to look for them

328
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,440
and

329
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,720
finally

330
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,000
the way that the air tag works

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
allows it to leverage a vast network for

332
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,680
long-range tracking which is

333
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
particularly disturbing so now we're

334
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,800
going to talk a little bit about that

335
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,120
so the close range tracking on um

336
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,760
on an air tag is done

337
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,839
via bluetooth what you do is you pair

338
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,199
your phone to uh to your air tag and if

339
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,920
you get out of range you you know you

340
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,199
get an alert

341
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,480
um

342
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,720
and this is fairly normal we see these

343
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
sorts of things all the time it's pretty

344
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,800
standard um

345
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,120
for example the

346
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,279
the tile does something

347
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,440
does something very similar you pair

348
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
your tile to your phone

349
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,639
you have the tile app installed on your

350
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,040
phone and then um

351
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,000
if you lose your tile it will let you

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,079
know when when you are out of range and

353
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,079
it will also tell you you know where

354
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,240
your tile is if you have lost it and

355
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,800
it's out of range um so with a tile uh

356
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,920
you're

357
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,480
uh if you have you know lot

358
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,680
lost your thing with a tile attached to

359
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,560
it in the middle of nowhere and you are

360
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,360
uh

361
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
you're not near a whole lot of other

362
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,839
phones you are really dependent on

363
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,480
somebody else coming along uh within

364
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,440
bluetooth range who has the tile app

365
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,839
installed on their phone

366
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,880
um the air tag on the other hand is

367
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,360
considerably more powerful which is one

368
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,480
of the reasons why uh i was i was so

369
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,440
outraged when uh when the air tag came

370
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,160
out

371
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,320
and what the air tag does is it turns

372
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
every single iphone with find my turned

373
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,000
on into the network which uh the other

374
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,040
air tags uh that the other air tags talk

375
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,680
to so you can probably go all day

376
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,360
uh without running into somebody who has

377
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,639
the tile app installed on uh on their

378
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,600
phone

379
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,399
but

380
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,120
uh

381
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,920
going all day without running into

382
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,959
bluetooth range of somebody with an

383
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,920
iphone that has my uh that has find my

384
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,519
installed on it i is considerably

385
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,040
less likely

386
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,800
so the the tracking power of the air tag

387
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,880
is much much stronger

388
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,720
so apple uh was was not completely blind

389
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,480
to the potential for misuse and it

390
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,000
includes some kind of anti-stalking

391
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,759
mitigations and the mitigations are as

392
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,079
follows uh the

393
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,040
iphone if you have an iphone

394
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,279
and the iphone notices that there is a

395
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,079
an air tag that's moving along with you

396
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,079
that is traveling where you are

397
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,199
traveling

398
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,160
it will give you a pop-up notice

399
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
uh furthermore when the air tag first

400
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,800
came out i it would uh it would wait uh

401
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,639
three days if it was out of range and

402
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,959
then it would start to give a sound

403
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,680
alert there's a little beeping noise uh

404
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
that beeping noise

405
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,520
is not very loud it's about 60 decibels

406
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,760
and it is extremely easy to muffle

407
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,280
so it has kind of a limited utility

408
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,760
especially if the person that you are

409
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,160
tracking uh has uh has hearing issues um

410
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
or again it's really easy to just like

411
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,880
stick it between some cushions or you

412
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,000
know uh tape it up so that it does not

413
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,080
it does not make this noise so the

414
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
effectiveness of this mitigation is

415
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,919
really limited

416
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,080
um

417
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,400
one of the things that apple did after

418
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,120
the

419
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,840
uh

420
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,240
after the air tag came out and there

421
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,080
were a lot of complaints about its

422
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,400
stalking abilities was they shortened

423
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,880
the amount of time that the air tag

424
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
would take in order to make this noise

425
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,799
uh from three days to one day so now

426
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,039
instead of three days of free stocking

427
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,520
you only get one day of free stocking

428
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,200
before the easily silenced beeping noise

429
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,559
begins

430
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,240
so what happens if you have an android

431
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,720
absolutely nothing uh the uh there is no

432
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,640
android app uh that allows you or rather

433
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,240
apple did not come out with an android

434
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,720
app that allows you to know when you are

435
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,360
being tracked by an air tag i and again

436
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,080
the sound alert is not very effective

437
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,440
uh furthermore one of the big problems

438
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,799
with the uh with the little b

439
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,880
noise that uh

440
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,400
that the air attack makes

441
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,520
when it is uh is out of range a phone

442
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,280
with which it is paired is that

443
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,480
frequently we are dealing with abusers

444
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,280
who

445
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,120
live with the people that they are

446
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,600
abusing and tracking i and if uh the

447
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
again the uh

448
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,320
the reset timer was at three days when

449
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,520
the air tag first came out so as long as

450
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,240
the air tag got within range of the

451
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,600
abuser's phone every three days the

452
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,679
even the little ineffective beeping

453
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,840
noise would not be set off

454
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,360
i and now that's been uh brought down to

455
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,320
24 hours which again is still

456
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
approximately as often as a uh as an

457
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,039
abuser will see their victim especially

458
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,440
if they are living together so

459
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,080
their reset loophole is kind of a big

460
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,080
deal

461
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,799
there are again a bunch of reasons why

462
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,360
we are concerned about the use of uh of

463
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,720
air tags uh as part of intimate partner

464
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,960
violence uh the first is that a partner

465
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,200
can

466
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,320
stick the

467
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
stick the air tag say

468
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,000
uh

469
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
in the back of a car between the

470
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
cushions or they can

471
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
stick the air tag into a into a bag

472
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,600
belonging to the victim that they that

473
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,120
they are trying to track i and again as

474
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,520
long as they come home once every 24

475
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,640
hours in order to reset uh they will

476
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,679
never be the wiser except for

477
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,640
uh

478
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,799
if they have an iphone and if they have

479
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,440
an iphone they may receive an alert that

480
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
tells them that there is an air tag

481
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,280
traveling with them if you have an

482
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,918
android you are out of luck

483
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
so we can talk a little bit how this

484
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,440
about how this uses uh

485
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
find my

486
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,679
uh we are already seeing news articles

487
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,000
uh both about the about the tile which

488
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,320
has been out for a very long time uh but

489
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,039
also about people being tracked using

490
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,960
error tags uh my contacts in the

491
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,320
domestic violence world uh have uh

492
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
informed me that they almost immediately

493
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,919
started seeing air attacks appear in the

494
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,919
bags and cars of uh the people that they

495
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,919
were working with who were trying to

496
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,600
escape intimate partner abuse

497
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,000
um there are some options or rather

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
there is one option right now i if you

499
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,240
are concerned about air tags and you

500
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
have an android uh which is this uh this

501
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,240
app right here uh airguard airguard is

502
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,159
uh up here on uh on github and you can

503
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,720
install it on your uh on your android

504
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,080
and it should tell you whether or not

505
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,400
there is an air tag or some other sort

506
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,120
of find my accessory following you uh i

507
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,880
cannot guarantee this because this is a

508
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,520
fairly new app and i have not yet had

509
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,280
an opportunity to test it myself uh

510
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,200
apple has also announced that they will

511
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,080
be coming out with an android app

512
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,400
but we are led to believe that it will

513
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,480
be coming in approximately december

514
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,559
which gives us several months of free

515
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,559
tracking and is very disturbing

516
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,679
so

517
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,080
what should apple have done

518
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,840
um

519
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,480
it turns out that there are actually

520
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,640
some guidelines for how you build

521
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,159
products that are resistant to

522
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,919
technology enabled intimate partner

523
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,440
abuse

524
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,679
the first is to

525
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,240
is that you should ah wrong slide

526
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,919
the first is that you should promote

527
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,200
diversity

528
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,039
i when you have teams composed of of

529
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,080
many different kinds of people they are

530
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,480
more likely to create products that that

531
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,600
address the needs of a more diverse

532
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,039
community

533
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,520
the second is that you need to guarantee

534
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,039
uh privacy and choice you need uh you

535
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,960
need your products to make it uh very

536
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
clear what information is uh is

537
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,799
available to what users and how to lock

538
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,880
everything down

539
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,520
the third is that you should

540
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
build your products in such a way that

541
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
they combat gas lighting

542
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
one of the ways in which you can do this

543
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,919
is

544
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,880
by having reliable logs

545
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,360
on your products to show you know are

546
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,679
you know who logged in at what time what

547
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,559
device were they logging in from and uh

548
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,640
and what did they do because uh

549
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,440
gaslighting is really one of the most

550
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,679
powerful tools of intimate partner abuse

551
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,080
uh the fourth is that you should

552
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,080
strengthen uh your security and

553
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,360
again the security of uh of the

554
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,159
data that uh that you are gathering uh

555
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,120
one of the interesting things about

556
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,240
studying stalkerware is that frequently

557
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,840
stalkerware is uh is not very effective

558
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,760
but in addition to not being effective

559
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,200
it is frequently not very secure there

560
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,080
have been uh i think something like half

561
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,600
a dozen

562
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
different instances in which a

563
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,640
stalkerware product uh was storing all

564
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,600
of the information uh that was uh you

565
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,799
know being covertly exfiltrated from

566
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,240
various users uh in a cnc and that cnc

567
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,320
was left wide open uh or was very easily

568
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,960
compromised uh so apple actually did a

569
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,720
fairly good job of that

570
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
but that is one of the one of the other

571
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,880
concerns and finally make technology

572
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,799
more intuitive the easier your

573
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
technology is to use and the easier it

574
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,960
is to understand who has access and who

575
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,279
does not have access

576
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,000
and how to use all you know all of your

577
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,880
your different settings uh the less

578
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,200
likely it is that your technology will

579
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,120
be used uh for intimate partner abuse uh

580
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,640
i am not the person who came up with

581
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,440
these principles these principles are uh

582
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,799
are from ibm and i strongly recommend

583
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,720
that that you read their report uh and

584
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,960
more importantly i strongly recommend

585
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,600
that apple read this report before

586
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,760
they put out more

587
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,039
new and exciting products

588
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,360
so where do we go from here

589
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,080
there

590
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,880
there is good news and there is bad news

591
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,760
uh the good news is that when it comes

592
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,360
to stalker wear

593
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,600
stalkerware has uh has definitely seen a

594
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,799
downturn

595
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
in the

596
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,559
in the apple ecosystem it is harder and

597
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,880
harder to use stalkerware

598
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,320
to spy on somebody's ios device uh

599
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,080
furthermore we have this wonderful

600
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,640
manual the manual allows us to uh to

601
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,400
lock people out in a way that is very

602
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,600
easy to uh to implement and that is easy

603
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
to follow the downside is that this

604
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,559
manual is in an obscure portion of the

605
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,320
internet uh and does not have a uh a

606
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,919
title that

607
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,640
uh that is very googleable and one of

608
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,120
the uh one of the downsides of this is

609
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,960
that i frequently have to be the person

610
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,240
who points uh the survivors of intimate

611
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,960
partner uh violence to this manual

612
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,880
instead of this manual being very easy

613
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,039
to find uh for survivors um

614
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,760
the bad news is that apple keeps putting

615
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,799
out products like the air tag so with

616
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,039
one in hand they they take it away with

617
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,880
the other hand they give it to the

618
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
stalkers

619
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
i was actually so angry about this that

620
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,200
i wrote an op-ed uh with albert foxconn

621
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,320
for wired called uh air tags are a gift

622
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,480
for stalkers um

623
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
and the mitigations that apple has in

624
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,440
place have a tremendous blind spot uh

625
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,640
the remember the number one uh principle

626
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,480
that people should be following in order

627
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,559
to build products that are resistant to

628
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,120
intimate partner abuse is diversity on

629
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,240
your team and uh i don't know how

630
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,080
diverse the team was that built the air

631
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,000
tag but i can tell you

632
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,480
that they had a tremendous blind spot

633
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,120
and their blind spot was android users

634
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,520
they simply could not imagine people who

635
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,080
lived entirely outside of the apple

636
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,159
ecosystem and as a result those are

637
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,720
people who are particularly vulnerable

638
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,039
to abuse using their product

639
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,360
so everything is great but also

640
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,039
everything is horrible

641
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,840
i am keeping an eye out for the android

642
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,039
app which apple has promised us in

643
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,919
december i and i am also keeping a very

644
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,120
wary eye out for future iot products

645
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,720
because i am fairly certain that that is

646
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,760
where we are likely to find uh sort of

647
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,399
the most disturbing developments

648
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,040
thank you very much

649
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:05,829
[Applause]
