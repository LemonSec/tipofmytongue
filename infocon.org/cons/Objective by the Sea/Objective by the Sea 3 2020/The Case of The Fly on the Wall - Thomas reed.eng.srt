1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,920
all right hey hey everybody um

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,240
i wish that i could be there with all of

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,080
you guys

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
i am

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,279
feeling a bit better today but

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,199
still glad i'm not there potentially

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,080
spreading germs

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,000
um

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,640
so today we're going to be talking about

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,880
the case

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,840
oh

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,280
can you hear me

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,440
yes

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,280
yes we can hear you loud and clear i

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
just uh muted the volume but you are

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,640
coming in perfectly

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,879
yeah i'm hearing that

18
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,559
much delayed echo at the moment

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,360
is

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
does he hear an echo on his hands

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,479
all right cool sounds good yeah

22
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,000
so i couldn't tell if it was a big delay

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
so um

24
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,200
so what we're going to be talking about

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,840
today is the case of the flying wall

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,200
we're going to be talking about a

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,759
particular piece of malware called fruit

28
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,040
flap

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,439
um fruit fly uh it is very interesting

30
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,360
kind of old not there and um

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
there are some legal issues involved

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
here so um

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
we're going to have a

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,159
some interesting stories

35
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,320
so a little bit about me first of all i

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,079
am thomas reed i work for normal nights

37
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
and um

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
the reason i'm talking about this is

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
that

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
we were the first to write about

41
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,810
denominator and

42
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,480
[Music]

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
there's an interesting story around

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
around that as well so we're going to

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,239
get into that

46
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,599
so a little bit about through flying uh

47
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,080
first of all it was a very

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,599
unique

49
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,959
all-purpose backdoor

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
it

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,120
was

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,440
consisted of a pearl script that

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,040
contained a number of helper processes

54
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,560
and these were all at the end of the

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
script and the data block

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,599
uh and the the main girl script would

57
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,720
extract and run them under certain

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
conditions

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
and this is fairly unique among magnolia

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
i don't think i've ever seen lisa

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
vancouver do the same thing

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,920
so

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
the main

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,840
first stage pearl

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
the main task that it did was

66
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
communicate with the command control

67
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,560
server and executing some commands

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
with the assistants in some cases of

69
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
these helpers

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,599
[Music]

71
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,319
these helpers would be extracted and run

72
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,400
under certain conditions when certain

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,120
commands were received

74
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
and

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,799
one of the things this malware would do

76
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,879
which is common to most backdoors is an

77
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,000
exfiltration of data and it was

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,080
particularly interested in

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
any kind of

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
images or audio so anything through the

81
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,080
microphone

82
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
webcam

83
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,519
screen

84
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,879
uh evening

85
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,560
that sort of stuff it was very

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
interested in that data

87
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,120
so if we look at the perl script um it's

88
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
fairly simple overall and they're just

89
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,760
going to look at a short snippet of it

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,560
um

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,760
this

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,159
pearl script basically loops

93
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
through the loop every 10 seconds

94
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,519
and it sleeps and then just waits for 10

95
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,000
seconds

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,720
each time through it will read one byte

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,238
from the command and control server

98
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,120
and

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,000
depending on what that byte what number

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,280
that is

101
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
it will execute different commands

102
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,639
and so for example we're showing here

103
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,400
that

104
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
light 2

105
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,560
would be the command to

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,800
do a screen capture

107
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,120
and so it would use

108
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,600
just standard macos

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,919
pre-installed

110
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,240
commands i will use the screen capture

111
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
command

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,080
to capture the screen to temporary

113
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,560
folder

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
it would then read that

115
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,160
image

116
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,199
right into memory

117
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,360
and finally it would write that image

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,880
out to socket uh sending it back up to

119
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
the command and control server

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
this is just an example of one

121
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
thing that it did also do things like

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,600
capture images through the webcam it

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,440
could

124
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
download files it can

125
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,360
execute arbitrary commands

126
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,960
you know you name it has got all the

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,720
standard command and control behaviors

128
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
uh one really interesting thing about

129
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,759
this

130
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,960
is that

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,680
looking into the mock level binary that

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,560
was

133
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
one of those helpers in the data section

134
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
girl

135
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
it contained a lot of really ancient

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,280
code and i'm talking really like dating

137
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,160
back to the early days of

138
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
the

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,240
uh so in particular one of the

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,120
uh sets of apis that people try to call

141
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,160
are g world related calls

142
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,600
if you're old like me you might remember

143
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
those from

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,360
the late 80s early 90s

145
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
when i actually had to read the old

146
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
inside macintosh books to get

147
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
information about

148
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
how to use g world calls because the

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
internet didn't really exist yet

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,440
not

151
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,479
in such a form that i could look things

152
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,800
up on apple's website

153
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,319
um

154
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,759
so

155
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,919
that was really really very interesting

156
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,520
and it suggested that this power has

157
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,479
been around for a while

158
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,800
now we're not going to go too deep into

159
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
details here

160
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
so if you're really interested in

161
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,160
learning more about this malware and

162
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,800
more about what it does

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,199
i i highly recommend patrick's paper

164
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,199
that you wrote for virus bulletin uh

165
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,199
this paper is

166
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,000
um

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,479
it's really comprehensive has a lot of

168
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,240
good details in it

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,840
uh and you're you're gonna be

170
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,599
hard-pressed to find a better source for

171
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,479
information on this malware

172
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,919
so at this point we're going to kind of

173
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,160
shift gears a little bit and we're going

174
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,360
to

175
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,599
start looking at the story of the

176
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,440
malware and how this malware came out

177
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,520
who is responsible

178
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,319
and

179
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,000
what's happened to that individual

180
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,199
so

181
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,599
we go all the way back to

182
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,560
january 4th of 2017

183
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,120
and that's when the story

184
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,000
more or less starts now

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,319
it kind of went back further than that

186
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,840
but nobody knew about it yet

187
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,039
so

188
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,240
on january 4th in 2017 case western

189
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
reserve university in cleveland

190
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,160
was notified of an infection by a third

191
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,400
party we don't know exactly who that

192
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
third party was

193
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,680
that that information has not been made

194
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
but this third party

195
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
shared indicators of compromise that

196
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,280
allowed

197
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,560
case western to look through its

198
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
systems and

199
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,240
find the infection

200
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,319
and they found that they had more than

201
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,280
100 systems that were infected with this

202
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,840
malware

203
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,520
so the next day

204
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,120
of course they contacted the fbi uh the

205
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,400
fbi began their investigation

206
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,520
and

207
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,560
just uh just a day later on january 6

208
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
the fbi already had a suspect that they

209
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,080
had identified

210
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,839
so what the fbi found is that the

211
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,679
computers that were compromised hadn't

212
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,880
been compromised for several years

213
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,920
without this malware being detected

214
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
and

215
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,519
one interesting thing they found that a

216
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,760
particular ip address that was being

217
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
used by the malware

218
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,200
was also

219
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,839
being used or have been used to access

220
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,200
an alumni email account belonging to

221
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,160
philip roman duracinsky

222
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,560
so that's a pretty major upset available

223
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,279
and it led to philip

224
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,160
durkinski becoming a suspect

225
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,519
in the

226
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,360
creation distribution of this malware

227
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
so then a few days later january 10th

228
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,519
uh i

229
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,480
learned about this malware from a slack

230
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,320
uh mac event slack um

231
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
one of the channels there uh somebody

232
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,640
that i knew posted

233
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
a a

234
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,279
message saying that he found this hidden

235
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,600
file at the root level of the user

236
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,399
directory on one of his systems

237
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
and this was at a western uh medical

238
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,880
center

239
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,320
uh connected to a university

240
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,240
and he was curious what this thing was

241
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,800
and what it was doing uh and so he

242
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,680
provided me with a copy of file

243
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,320
and i started analyzing it found some

244
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,360
very interesting things um

245
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,720
you know found a lot of things that

246
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,519
we've already discussed and more

247
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,399
and

248
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,000
very quickly realized that this was

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,760
malware so started working on a write-up

250
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
for it

251
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,040
now

252
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
between them and the 18th when we

253
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,519
actually published our blog posts

254
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,519
i did contact apple make them aware

255
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,720
and

256
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
for the first time i actually got a

257
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,760
response back and i got some information

258
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,800
back from apple they wanted me to

259
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
hold off on the blog post for just a

260
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,279
little while

261
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,279
and it turned out that the fbi was

262
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,040
already investigating which i was not

263
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,519
aware of at the time

264
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,120
and

265
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,600
they wanted to give the fbi engine time

266
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,560
to

267
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
do their investigation

268
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,200
so we agreed that we published on

269
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
january 18

270
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,800
and so at 10 am we published our blog

271
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
the same day it was also an mrt update

272
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
that

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,720
began detecting this malware on

274
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
via

275
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,040
apple's

276
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,519
malware

277
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,039
[Music]

278
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,600
so then about

279
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
12 hours later same day

280
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
the fbi

281
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,360
raided durochinski's

282
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,320
place of residence the address that they

283
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,760
traced to this id

284
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,320
and the house turned out to belong to

285
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
durgency's parents

286
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,040
uh they lived there and he

287
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,519
uh sometimes would stay there on the

288
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,560
weekends so he didn't really live there

289
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,399
anymore

290
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,200
the fbi asked if they could enter

291
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
and were allowed they were invited in

292
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,279
um interestingly enough uh derici's

293
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,240
parents

294
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
told the fbi that he'd been in trouble

295
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,880
for hacking in high school

296
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,000
i'm not sure why they would say that you

297
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,839
know the fbi

298
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,800
knocking and asking about yourself um

299
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
so that is

300
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
that's interesting it's an interesting

301
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,760
little tidbit

302
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,519
not sure that i know

303
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
i entirely understand it

304
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,120
and the fbi um

305
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,079
was shown into durochinski's bedroom

306
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,600
where they found

307
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,720
a laptop that was just slightly charged

308
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
according to court documents

309
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,320
and it was currently on and it was being

310
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
remote controlled at that moment

311
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,959
so obviously the fbi was concerned about

312
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,120
deletion of the the evidence they were

313
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,200
concerned that the urgency was removing

314
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
into the machine and deleting everything

315
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,880
that could take him

316
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
back to

317
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,279
this malware um they were concerned that

318
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,079
he'd been tipped off by

319
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,000
some guy who published a blog post

320
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
so

321
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,639
and

322
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,120
so the fbi very quickly pulled the plug

323
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,320
on the router to prevent any further

324
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,079
activity whatever was going on on the

325
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,880
laptop and they confiscated the laptop

326
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,639
and a number of hard drives another

327
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
electronica

328
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,800
and they took that with them

329
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,120
so

330
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,600
just a few hours later in the wee hours

331
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
in the morning on january 19th

332
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,519
they

333
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,199
the fbi got a warrant to

334
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,240
access the data that was on those those

335
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,600
drives in that computer

336
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,040
and when they

337
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
began investigating

338
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,399
they found

339
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
over 20 million collected files that

340
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,920
were collected from

341
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,360
thousands of victims

342
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
and among the data that was found

343
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
were

344
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,920
a number of child pornography files

345
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,839
which is highly disturbing

346
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,319
so

347
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
it might i guess it took the fbi a

348
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,279
little bit of time to gather all this

349
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,160
data again all the evidence and so it

350
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,519
wasn't until january 25th

351
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,760
that durkinski was finally arrested

352
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,639
now

353
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,880
a little time passed here a couple of

354
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,800
months and the fbi in late march

355
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
issued a flash with details on the

356
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
malware to select

357
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,279
affected companies

358
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,720
this flash was originally issued as tlp

359
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,600
amber meaning an all-new chair with

360

361
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,120
in the same company

362
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,360
since that time it has been linked

363
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,800
online and is now public knowledge so

364
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,639
i don't feel too bad about sharing some

365
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
of the details here

366
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,279
and one of the interesting things there

367
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,079
was that the class shared technical

368
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,480
details about

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,130

use of

374

by third-party data reaches

377
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,399
durginsky

378
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,880
allegedly

379

used a number of different

for a long time we didn't know exactly

392
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,279
what you know how these files died

393
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,720
we knew that he got this remote access

394
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,079
um

395
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,519
hannah figured that maybe he just

396
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,440
uploaded the files and activated the

397
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,519
manual instance it wasn't particularly

398
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,959
complex

399
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,279
uh nowhere it was just one file and one

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,480
p list when launched in keyless

401

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,880
um

404
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,079
had the proper script for a couple of

405
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,240
years and hadn't been able to release it

406
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,440
because of his former employer

407
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,279
he decided that since his talk was

408
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,560
coming up he was going to go ahead and

409
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,279
release this script

410
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,000
and

411
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,079
let people see it and it's very

412
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,160
interesting it shows that there's a lot

413
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,640
more that we didn't know about how this

414
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,559
malware got installed and even some

415
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,400
variants of them out there that we never

416
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
saw

417
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,400
so if you're interested in looking at

418
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
that script

419
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,439
you can look at this url here

420
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,400
i'll be glad to publish these slides

421
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,919
afterwards so you don't have to worry

422
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,760
about finding that url later

423
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,520
so if we fast forward another

424
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,120
a year

425
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,220

[Music]

427
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,200
duroczynski was finally actually

428
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,559
indicted on 16 counts

429
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,400
and you can see here there were a number

430
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,640
of different accounts here

431
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,559
including protection of child

432
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,480
pornography

433
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,840
and illegal wiretapping

434
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,679
there were actually

435
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,120
five

436
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,840
indicated cases where

437
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,559
he listened into conversations between

438
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,200
two people

439
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,799
in the court documents

440
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,760
so

441
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,880
a lot of charges here being being

442
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
leveraged against mr georgeson

443
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,160
now

444
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,600
fast forward

445
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
to 2019

446
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
in april

447
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,240
the defense filed a motion to suppress

448
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
evidence

449
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,559
and the reason is

450
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,200
they're claiming an improper seizure

451
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,320
because the fbi did not actually have a

452
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,200
warrant at the time that they seized the

453
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,940
hardware

454
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,600
[Music]

455
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,240
the defense was suppression of all of

456
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,440
the evidence obtained from the laptop

457
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
and durginsky's confession which was

458
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,720
evidently given

459
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,039
following his arrest and being

460
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,360
confronted with the evidence

461
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,320
that had been gathered

462
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,600
so that's a problem obviously and

463
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
the prosecution

464
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
responded in may

465
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,400
and part of their response

466
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
said that

467
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,080
the big reason that they

468
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,240
seized that data that

469
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,840
hardware

470
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,600
was because of the blog post that i

471
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,640
published

472
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,799
on that day

473
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,200
and so there was concern

474
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,640
that

475
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,480
virginia would delete data and

476
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,039
they wanted to prevent that

477
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,480
so here we've got a problem where i

478
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,520
published a blog post and

479
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,559
this had a direct effect on potentially

480
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,919
the course of this this trial and could

481
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,799
be

482
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,120
a potential issue for the prosecution

483
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,679
now unfortunately the prosecution does

484
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,960
have some some good

485
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,520
arguments for or

486
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,960
why they were allowed to

487
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,679
take that hardware for example they

488
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,400
they

489
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,159
took the hardware out of the house but

490
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,919
they didn't actually

491
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,000
search it until they had the warrant um

492
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,760
and this is a there's apparently a

493
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,440
precedent for that so it's i don't think

494
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,000
that the defense is going to have

495
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,760
a case here

496
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,799
but

497
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,760
it still concerns me that something i do

498
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,360
might potentially

499
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,679
lead to

500
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,200
their urgency

501
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,600
getting away with what he did and the

502
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,360
evidence against him is pretty strong

503
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,720
so we fast forward to today

504
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,960
uh this trial is still going on the

505
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
debate is still continuing after

506
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,200
multiple hearings

507
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,240
and there still has not been a decision

508
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,559
reached on whether that evidence will be

509
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,039
suppressed or not

510
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,640
so

511
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,280
keeping uh keeping an eye on this case

512
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
and uh

513
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
hoping for the best hoping that i didn't

514
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,360
screw it up for the offense or for the

515
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,200
prosecution

516
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,980
um

[Music]

518
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
so what's the takeaway here

519
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,880
um

520
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,640
there are a few lessons that we can

521
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,919
learn here

522
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,159
now first of all obviously

523
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,840
malware disclosure is important for

524
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,559
victims so we had this malware

525
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,919
it had infected these systems for

526
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,280
years

527
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,240
potentially some systems were infected

528
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,120
for a decade

529
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,960
and these people didn't know about it

530
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,159
so

531
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,200
the disclosure was really important to

532
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
help people find it

533
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
um so you know when we posted our blog

534
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,600
post we had ises

535
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,159
that could help businesses

536
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,280
find

537
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,280
find the malware we publish hashes that

538
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
anti-high-risk vendors could use to

539
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,039
download

540
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,480
that

541
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,559
malware and

542
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,840
detection

543
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,280
um and of course you know i have

544
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
communicated with that also after this

545
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,679
protecting the user that's all very

546
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,679
important this is this is really

547
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,440
important for protecting the victims of

548
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,640
these crimes

549
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760
however

550
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,600
on the other side of this

551
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,240
sometimes the disclosure can interfere

552
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
with legal process

553
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,600
um so

554
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
that's one of the big things that i

555
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
learned here

556
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
this was

557
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,440
um

558
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,480
fairly early on it was the first malware

559
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,840
that i had found that i was

560
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,720
able to come up with a name for and

561
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
actually give it the first name

562
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,799
of course i did

563
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,480
kind of a crummy job with it nobody

564
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,240
calls it by the

565
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,159
bad name that i gave and everybody calls

566
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,960
it my app this name which is reply even

567
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,840
me okay

568
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,679
but

569
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,000
my excitement led me to

570
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,360
potentially

571
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
push this out a little bit sooner than i

572
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,679
should have uh and if i had been in

573
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,720
direct contact with the fbi then

574
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,240
some of this problem could have been

575
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,799
avoided

576
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,600
so

577
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,679
um

578
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,919
what i have learned here is to be more

579
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,799
mindful when disclosing

580
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,919
and what i would ask for all of you who

581
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,000
are you know involved in malware

582
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
investigation to do

583
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,080
is to consider engaging in law

584
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,320
enforcement when you do find something

585
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,480
interesting

586
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,039
and that can be something as simple as

587
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,240
some local law enforcement office

588
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,720
you know you could engage with the fbi

589
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,559
fairly directly

590
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,440
um you could also consider joining some

591
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,760
organizations such as infragard here in

592
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,960
the u.s

593
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,120
which is sort of a

594
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,200
two-way communication between the fbi um

595
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
i kind of have some mixed feelings about

596
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,960
joining infragard because there's a lot

597
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,120
of personal data that you can share in

598
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,520
order to join

599
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,000
but if that's not a problem for you uh

600
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,960
it sounds like uh

601
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,320
if you can build a fairly good

602
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
relationship with law enforcement and

603
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,799
really home now cases like this

604
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
and obviously some of you are not from

605
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,720
the united states so

606
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,919
the fbi is not the one you report to you

607
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,279
know so find whatever office is

608
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,480
for

609
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,080
your country

610
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,720
um and

611
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
continue with the knowledge disclosure

612
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
by all means but please also

613
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,200
make sure that you're engaging in law

614
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,760
enforcement when you think there's a

615
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,640
need to do so

616
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,760
and i hope that you guys enjoy this

617
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,520
story and

618
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,799
i'll be glad to take any questions

619
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,240
hmm

620
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,840
[Applause]

621
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,320
thomas i have uh one question

622
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,120
where's the hat

623
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,159
so yeah the hat actually i've got three

624
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,360
of them out there you can see my picture

625
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,200
up there

626
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,880
behind me let me stop sharing here

627
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,520
so uh

628
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,360
uh are there any questions for thomas

629
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,360
about uh case his research

630
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,279
yes

631
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,880
yeah did uh apple adopt any formal

632
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
policy changes

633
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,159
in the in the past three years because i

634
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,919
assume it's probably not your last first

635
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,720
and last coordination of athletes

636
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,559
so the question thomas was

637
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,679
did apple

638
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,720
change any policies uh based on this or

639
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,480
between when you

640
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
interact with them and now

641
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,039
to be honest i'm not sure

642
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
but it's i think that this was sort of

643
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,440
the beginning of having a good

644
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,200
relationship with apple

645
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,039
and you're having a better relationship

646
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
okay what was the thing that you picked

647
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,919
for the malware corporate play uh what

648
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,440
was the name of the malware that you

649
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,000
picked before fruit fly

650
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,559
and the story

651
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,200
so i think the malware

652
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,559
we mentioned

653
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,080
which is a very hard

654
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,649
[Applause]

655
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,760
but it's hard to figure out what they're

656
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,679
going to be

657
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,919
and finally were you concerned at all

658
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,559
that during the trial that you perhaps

659
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,720
would be called in as a witness uh

660
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
perhaps by either the defense or the

661
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,120
prosecution because you are essentially

662
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,918
an expert in

663
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,840
yeah a little this um it

664
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
could have been a very interesting

665
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,279
experience but it also you know

666
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,440
going to test it in court could also be

667
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,279
kind of intimidating and

668
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,000
time consuming so i have mixed feelings

669
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,480
about that

670
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,320
yes

671
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,399
since apple was in communication with

672
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,679
the fbi

673
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,240
when thomas reached out to apple did

674
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,080
that will give any sort of time frame

675
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,960
when they ask you to

676
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,480
so the question was thomas uh once

677
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,679
you've contacted apple since apple was

678
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,159
uh contacted the fbi um and what were

679
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,919
the communications there and apple gave

680
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,200
you a specific

681
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,520
timeline to hold off on the blog post or

682
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
was it just you know hey can you wait as

683
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,158
long as possible

684
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
yeah so we did communicate

685
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,039
i knew that the airfield was involved

686
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,360
any questions for thomas

687
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,279
all right well thanks again i hope you

688
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,279
feel better soon and

689
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,440
i know i'll see you at objective c 4.0

690
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,600
so

691
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,050
all right thanks again thomas

692
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:34,479
