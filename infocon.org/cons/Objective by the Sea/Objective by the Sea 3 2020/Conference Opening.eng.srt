55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,200
one so

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,920

our amazing speakers

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
now as i'm sure you're all aware

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,440
um so i just want to you know make a few

68
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
points it's fun to joke about this stuff

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
but in all seriousness uh we really want

70
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
to make sure that this event is done in

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,800
a

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,879
healthy and safe manner uh so first and

73
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,159
foremost just want to let you know we

74
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,360
have been in fuel contact with uh local

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
health officials here in hawaii maui

76
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
lovely has had no cases so far and also

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,640
work closely with the hotel to ensure

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
that the environment is as clean and

79
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,519
safe as possible that having been said

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,040
one of the most important things we need

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
do with attendees is ensure that we wash

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400
our hands now it sounds silly but this

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,720
is something that's very important

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,360
to do the cbdc has more information

85
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,599
about this so i recommend hopping on

86
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,959
through their website

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,480
you can talk about how to wash your

88
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,518
hands well

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
but also you know the other thing you

90
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,680
can do to ensure our safety and if

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
anyone's delaying uh

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
during the conference you know i asked

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,680
many uh

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,840
livestream versus you know coming back

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
um in here but again i think we can

96
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,519
ensure that ultimately we are all safe

97
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
and have an amazing time here in hawaii

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,959
now one of my favorite things about the

99
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,599
conference is that we always partner

100
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,680
with a local charity to

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,478
raise money for a charitable cause

102
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,120
so i know many of you were at biology

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
2.0

104
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,400
at that conference we raised several

105
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
thousand dollars for a

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,040
charity in argentina

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,400
who works with

108
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,479
people from you know vulnerable social

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,320
sectors teaching them

110
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
uh about two weeks ago we received a

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,120
letter from them basically talking about

112
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
the money that conference the attendees

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,720
were able to raise and you know we can

114
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,199
really see that um you know this is

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,040
really making an amazing difference uh

116
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
just you know 40 women between the ages

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,639
of 18 and 50 were trained to aspire for

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,400
their first formal job i mean this is

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
life-changing stuff so

120
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,639
i just you know something that's really

121
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,960
meaningful to me and something that i

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
think is really positive that we can all

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
do together at the conference so this

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,960
year we're joining again with emua it's

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,520
a local charity based here in hawaii

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,800
it works

127
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,160
with

128
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,720
families who have children with um

129
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
developmental issues uh in hawaii the

130
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
social health system here is sometimes

131
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,000
really so far uh so these are doing the

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
the company's doing the incredible work

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,720
so the t-shirt sales um 30 suggested

134
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
donations 100 of sales goes to this

135
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,360
charity also then the conference is 100

136
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
