1
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,039
so i don't really know a lot about apple

2
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,439
tv so i'm also really excited about this

3
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,760
let's get around

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,760
so for those of you who don't know me my

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
name is kevin bradley i go by neato tv

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,000
on twitter and associated other areas

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,120
irc

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,840
slack

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,200
discord i've been doing

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
i've been hacking these devices since

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
the very first apple tv came out in 2007

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,920
and 2008. it didn't do what i wanted to

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
do so i was like let's make it do it

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,600
like i saw other people hacking it i saw

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
they were in the chat room awkward tv

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,239
and i decided to join in on the phone i

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,160
said why not you know

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
it doesn't do what we want let's make it

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,600
do it

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
fast forward to 2010

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,799
and

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,200
check out sorry i'll check way too early

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
on that one 2010 and the second

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
generation apple tv came out it had an

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
arm there's six or seven processor

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
pretty sure it was six

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,560
and

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,479
that meant that meant you're no longer

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,159
on intel because the very first box in

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,320
2007 was an intel machine is pretty much

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,960
a mac mini that was shrunk down

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,799
like like so it wasn't really so

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,640
squished but then widened and then you

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,479
had your hdmi port your component output

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,000
your optical audio

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,320
and a usb port which we made great use

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
of

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
but now since it has arm everything

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
you've done on ios up to this point is

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,799
helpful in some way but they know

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,880
nothing about apple tv so you have the

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
entirety of the chronic dev team

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,479
streaming into an awkward tv channel

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,680
because they're like oh this is where

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
this is happening let's join forces and

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,439
figure this out that's how i joined

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,840
chronic dancing

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
now what brings me here today i work for

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,680
guardian if you haven't heard of us we

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,159
make a awesome vpn app for the iphone we

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,439
have a sort of other things we're doing

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,199
as well that we're working on that i

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,959
will go over as well but that's like the

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
main thing we're known for at this

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
moment excuse me

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,480
and i've also developed a series of

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
products projects whatever moving up to

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
this point when check brain checkmate

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,480
and all that stuff happened and i'm

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
going to outline that first and then i'm

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,080
going to get into the you know the the

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,720
media details

63
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,239
that's right

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,680
i'm used to having to use the remote

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
so these are some of the projects these

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,560
are some of the icons for them you can

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,120
look down there too

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,360
so you have ethereal reprovision

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
air photo

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
uh breezy and and control i will cover

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,400
all those in

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,879
some different form as we move forward

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,680
so september 2018 if you aren't familiar

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,200
with the anvils i always have to have

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,959
them in my presentation at least once

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,480
i'm usually kind of aggressive and it's

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,159
every single point this time i'm like i

78
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,879
don't have time for that

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,840
but yes melissa they're there

80
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
excuse me so

81
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,519
while working on neto tv the app store

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,879
for tv os

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,360
so to backtrack a tiny bit

84
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
when you want to buy an app or a tweak

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
or anything else on the iphone ipad or

86
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,200
things of that nature when it's

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
jailbroken or just outside of apple's

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,599
parameters you got to go to a jailbroken

89
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,360
store you have cydia you have a bunch of

90
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
different i mean so city is how it all

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,000
started

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
silio supports it installer supports it

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,159
there's a bevy of installers that

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,680
support it but for the apple tv we

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
didn't have one that had any store

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
infrastructure until the store that i

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
recently released and launched around

98
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
the same time that this all happened

99
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,519
so i started on the untitled controller

100
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,360
project working up to this that soon

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,879
became end control

102
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,400
and if you've never heard of controllers

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
for all what it did is it made it

104
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,599
possible for the playstation 4 xbox one

105
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
wiimote and

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,200
i can't remember what other controllers

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
but there's maybe one or two more work

108
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
on your iphone your ipad if you were

109
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,120
jailbroken because you have

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,760
the mfi product of the mfi program that

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
i'm sure many of you if not all of you

112
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,879
are familiar with

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,720
that you got to be certified for it it

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
needs to have a lightning port it has to

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
have these number of buttons i don't

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
know if the layout is mandated but

117
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,079
either way it's very strict playstation

118
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
4 xbox one things of that nature we're

119
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,560
not on the list

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,919
sorry i realized my laptop wasn't

121
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,400
plugged in

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
last but not least

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
so my aim because the author of that

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
project i can't pronounce his name

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
properly so i'm not going to try he

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,880
works for um

127
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
forgetting the company name

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
celebrate he works for celebrate now

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,080
so

130
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
since he was too busy to do that because

131
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,680
that is his nine to five gig that's all

132
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,880
he does now

133
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,639
i took over and i'm like all right so

134
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,320
let's figure out a way to not only make

135
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
it work on ios but make it work on t or

136
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,000
make it work on ios again

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
tbos as well

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,639
so i started investigating what what uh

139
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,639
matthias ringwald he wrote his own

140
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,800
custom bluetooth stack for all of this

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,280
to work on the iphone but what that

142
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,759
meant the side effect of that was that

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,919
you had to completely tear down the

144
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,199
normal bluetooth stack because you

145
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,360
couldn't have two competing ones

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
so i'm like all right we'll just try to

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,520
use his make it work on more modern ios

148
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
and then after that

149
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,759
see if it works on tv os

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,440
there's a little tiny problem

151
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,440
the siri remote

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,520
that uses bluetooth i did not feel like

153
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
rewriting something or updating bt stack

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,039
to make that work

155
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,280
never mind

156
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,360
so plan b from there which should have

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
actually been plan b plan a for being

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
honest make it work natively the less

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
dependencies the better and it's also

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
harder for apple to restrict it or break

161
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,080
it if you're making things work native

162
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,560
sorry they kind of

163
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,070
nope they're not slow i'm slow

164
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,280
[Laughter]

165
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,560
march 2019

166
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
so 3 15 19 was the end control tbos and

167
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,360
ios release it was soft for tv os

168
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,199
because i didn't have my store up yet

169
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,479
but i was sick and tired of people

170
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,479
saying shut up and take my money

171
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,840
who wants to hear that and like not

172
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,479
actually be like okay

173
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,120
i wanted to launch it all at once but i

174
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
couldn't so i'm like let's just get it

175
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,759
out there and uh and patreon i started a

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,600
patreon account and patrons were the

177
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,960
only people that initially could get it

178
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160
for tv os

179
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
but it wasn't like you had to continue

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,120
contributing it was like a one-time

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,160
thing so

182
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
buy it and cancel if you want or if you

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
continue to contribute it's up to you

184
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,560
there was no

185
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
requirement it was kind of like a thing

186
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
to get there to get it in people's hands

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
as early as possible

188
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
but yeah it was uh essentially as i

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
mentioned before the revamped version of

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,440
controllers for all but it worked it

191
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,280
works completely natively so you didn't

192
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,520
need bt stack and i thought it was gonna

193
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
be harder for apple to break it but they

194
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,759
actually broke it pretty quickly so

195
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,160
we'll get to that later

196
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
oh and if you want to see more info that

197
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,919
you can go to the wiki the awkward tv

198
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,840
wiki is the source of truth for all

199
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,759
apple tv jobs we have maintained it

200
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,520
since the very first apple tv and i

201
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,799
still maintain it to this day

202
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,639
so then

203
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,800
about 10 days later apple's like hey

204
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
guys apple arcade

205
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,639
it's going to come out playstation 4

206
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,199
xbox one all these games all the stuff

207
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,680
i'm sure you all heard of it at least

208
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,840
so it's like all right that's uh awesome

209
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,280
thanks guys

210
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,318
so i kind of felt like this

211
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,319
so at this point instead of being down

212
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
in the doldrums and like you know oh

213
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,599
what was me because this is the thing

214
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,440
like they sherlock stuff all the time we

215
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
have a term for it it's called sherlock

216
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
based on something they called sherlock

217
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,160
when they stole something else what did

218
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
they even steal or was it

219
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
i don't remember the exact story at this

220
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,639
point but it's

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,400
it's that bad that you should be ready

222
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
for it that's the point that's that's

223
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,960
the bullet point

224
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,199
so thinking of ways okay how can i make

225
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,000
end control attractive again so people

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
still want to buy it and i hadn't even

227
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,199
launched my store yet i was like if i

228
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,560
launched the store and it has the lap

229
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,840
where's the beef

230
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,080
so excuse me sorry

231
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
people had highly requested it to work

232
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
with this game called pub pubg

233
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
and they gave you one joystick support

234
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,360
really slowly so you have your right

235
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,879
joystick whether you like pan left and

236
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,400
right up and down and then the left

237
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
joystick as you imagine is supposed to

238
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,759
move you around they got as far as the

239
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,080
left joystick the right joystick ah we

240
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,519
don't feel like doing this so it's

241
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,880
partially there

242
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
just the rest of it didn't work which

243
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,799
was nice for me because that's the

244
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,479
hardest part because the way i made it

245
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,799
work i took it so it was just a

246
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
screenshot of the screen size whatever

247
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
so it needed some work it could have

248
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,839
been smarter but it's like oh this

249
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,160
button is here expect them to push here

250
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,360
i'm going to send this command that it

251
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
expects so it was just like

252
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,279
it's kind of like actually uh another

253
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,360
product that uh matthias made called

254
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
blue troll or blue control where you

255
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,560
literally would just be like take a

256
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
screenshot you would tell it where the

257
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
buttons were and then it would just

258
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,040
automatically click those for you

259
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,839
through mimic touch

260
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,279
events but since it was such an easy

261
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,120
thing and it was such a good template i

262
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,200
decided why don't i support all of these

263
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
other things as well sorry i'm

264
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
modulating a lot i need to like

265
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
all right anyway so like okay mobile

266
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
legends was highly recommended or

267
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
requested fifa was pro-evolution soccer

268
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
was so i supported all those as well

269
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,959
with very minimal code changes i cranked

270
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,680
all of these out after pub c was done

271
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
in maybe like a week so

272
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
pub c took a while because getting it to

273
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
move around based on navigation for the

274
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,920
left control that was still a disaster

275
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,040
so in august 2019 about six months after

276
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
all that happened

277
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,120
i finally released the neato tv store

278
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,399
and if you would like to know more about

279
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,920
it there's an introductory blog post

280
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
here and i will be releasing this it is

281
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
an app as you noticed i'll be releasing

282
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,519
it as the app and the slides as well

283
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,200
because what i did is i took a keynote

284
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
export it to html and this is loading it

285
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
through a web view this is how that app

286
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,839
works

287
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,000
so

288
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,440
once you first open neato tv the first

289
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
thing you would see is this app store it

290
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
has i tried to make it look as close as

291
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,880
what you're used to if you have an apple

292
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,640
tv and you go to the featured section

293
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,040
you go in here you see the top section

294
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
it kind of banners through it passes

295
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
through those are like the biggest most

296
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,399
important projects and then everything

297
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,320
is just categorized gaming is the first

298
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
one multimedia is the second there's

299
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,320
other categories below but this is kind

300
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,839
of just to give you the gist of what you

301
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,760
should expect if you actually go through

302
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,319
this process

303
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,000
end control is currently the only

304
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,480
project for now but that is going to

305
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
change in the near future and initially

306
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,480
you could only pay with amazon pay but

307
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,040
there is now paypal support as well

308
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
i will support next to other developers

309
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,560
selling on this because it's no fun if

310
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
it's just me as soon as possible that's

311
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,560
the next step that's the next phase for

312
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,519
the store setup

313
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,959
so once you actually select a paid

314
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,399
product or any product for that matter

315
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
but this is an example of a paid one you

316
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,360
can see you have the some info about it

317
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,200
you can say your name what's that what

318
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
uh what category goes in you have

319
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
screenshots below you can actually have

320
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,399
a screenshot to the right as well but i

321
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,519
didn't feel like i needed to go in

322
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,120
through every exhaustive detail just

323
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
kind of give you the gist of it

324
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
so after this

325
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
checkmate was released and this is one

326
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,079
of the most monumental occasions in the

327
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,320
history of this community i cannot

328
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,839
understate how amazing this is

329
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
so in late september

330
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,839
27 2019 to be exact uh checkmate slash

331
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,480
iphone dfu was released by axims

332
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,560
and i i just say we should run him for

333
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
president next i mean i'd vote for him

334
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
so as i mentioned there hasn't been

335
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,120
anything like this in about 10 years

336
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,639
shatter and lime rain were the only

337
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,920
things that are analogous to it they

338
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
were both boot rom exploits but they

339
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,399
didn't cover as many devices

340
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,800
as i mean you compare like the a4 and

341
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,399
that was all they could work on actually

342
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,600
the

343
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
i think shatter only worked on the a4 no

344
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,760
they both were a4 only but i think like

345
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
shatter even worked on more limited

346
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
devices than just that but the apple tv

347
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,440
will support it so i eventually had to

348
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,839
use it because the usb stack between i

349
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,920
think

350
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
let's see what became before i'll catch

351
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
the time what was that before that those

352
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,160
two like between there it just they

353
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
rewrote it and just broke everything so

354
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
i had to actually use it and

355
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
it was a lot of work it was fun but it

356
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000
was a lot of work

357
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,880
so

358
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
what you can do with this the most

359
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,880
important part about it is you can

360
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
pretty much do anything it's like the

361
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,839
wild west it's like a renaissance right

362
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
now you can dump keys you can disable

363
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,399
kttr kpp uh

364
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,399
pack like all of that

365
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,440
gone

366
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,240
and it makes everything so much better

367
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,680
your phone actually runs better

368
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,760
jailbroken now because all those things

369
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,920
take cycles to get their thing done to

370
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
try and block and see are you doing

371
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
stuff you're not supposed to you get rid

372
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
of those cycles you're burning less

373
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,959
battery and your phone and device are

374
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,519
actually running better it's

375
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,959
like a miracle

376
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,279
um excuse me so the third and the fifth

377
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,880
apple tv or the third through the fifth

378
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,680
apple tv this exploit applies to all of

379
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,480
those

380
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,639
when he released iphone dfu it didn't

381
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,160
support any of them because he has a lot

382
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,519
of devices to support like you can see

383
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,839
the soc list he supported all of those

384
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,240
initially so i mean i couldn't begrudge

385
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,040
him

386
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,079
so

387
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,440
i mean he just released the best exploit

388
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,279
ever nobody could have wrote him

389
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,880
so moving along while everyone was

390
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,360
really buzzing and excited about this i

391
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
was really busy working on other things

392
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
at the same time playing catch up so to

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,399
speak because i just launched my store

394
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,639
or whatever so

395
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,120
i was not really i was excited about it

396
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,040
but i wasn't involved in it i was uh

397
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
discovering the fact that you can

398
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,800
unidirectionally which i will be demo in

399
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,760
a moment

400
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
send and receive files with airdrop on

401
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,399
the apple tv why apple left this out and

402
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,560
doesn't let us use it you're in your

403
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
guess is as good as mine i have no idea

404
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,079
but i wasn't about to let that go

405
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,320
sliding like that's amazing there's so

406
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,040
much potential

407
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,079
so i released breezy and ethereal in

408
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,199
really

409
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,279
horrible iterations it uses it used ns

410
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,360
distributed notification centers and if

411
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,959
you listen for that notification you'll

412
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,639
be like oh i like this file somebody

413
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,000
else be like oh i also like this file

414
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,959
thankfully it was just me in the

415
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,560
playground at the time so it didn't

416
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,320
really matter it was a nice little stop

417
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,600
gap just to kind of wet people's

418
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
appetite this is the kind of things that

419
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
are going to be possible what ethereal

420
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,760
is it allows you to airdrop videos of

421
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,160
pretty much anything that vlc or ffm can

422
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
can play straight to your apple tv and

423
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,040
they will play immediately

424
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,320
excuse me

425
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
i'm sorry aside from that i was also

426
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,519
updating uh chimera and elektra so

427
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,959
there was a lot of things on my plate i

428
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,720
didn't have time to be working on

429
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,279
anything with it

430
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,000
okay so here comes the airdrop demo

431
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,760
so i was going to try

432
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,040
and demo it through this app and i had

433
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
it working a moment ago and then it

434
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,160
tripped up again but i still want to

435
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,240
show you what it looks like so because

436
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
i'm doing this through an apple tv and i

437
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,600
wasn't anticipating having this awesome

438
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,320
screen down here i rolled my own thing

439
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,560
into air magic and what air magic is

440
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
it's a web server that runs and it just

441
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,519
listens for a few different uh

442
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,079
get commands you know like uh remote up

443
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,079
remote down whatever and it'll do that

444
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,360
for the remote it'll move it left it'll

445
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,079
move right so your apple tv can support

446
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,759
anything that supports a web browser

447
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,279
curl even to do the navigation

448
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,880
so i took air magic and i'm like why

449
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
don't i just augment that and have it do

450
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
some extra commands that it listens for

451
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,000
through maybe a different web server

452
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
because air magic is kind of old and not

453
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,320
my best code base and listen for a few

454
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
other things like you know current slide

455
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,639
next slide what are the things that i'm

456
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
looking for you're like what am i

457
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,079
working with so

458
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,759
to demonstrate it better so i don't

459
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,680
sound like a crazy person i'll just show

460
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,160
you what it looks like

461
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,000
after i ear drop it

462
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
okay

463
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
so if all goes well

464
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,639
oh and also i tried to implement it the

465
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,480
same as you expected anywhere else so if

466
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,759
you airdrop to this and other things

467
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,759
support photos which air photo does it

468
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,920
can also accept it but we want check

469
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
green tv to do it instead and there you

470
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,360
go

471
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,440
so that is an example of airdrop working

472
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,959
on the apple tv accepting

473
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,440
pretty cool right

474
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
i was very excited about this i was like

475
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,279
why aren't they letting us do this

476
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,639
i'll press menu get rid of it

477
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,480
ah tell me that

478
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
what

479
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,560
it's still showing up there

480
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,399
that's weird

481
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
this one i don't think is my fault

482
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,639
oh it probably triggered something over

483
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,480
there sorry guys

484
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,639
the siri one is really finicky so i only

485
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,720
trust this one i'll make sure i keep it

486
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
down here

487
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,319
thank you

488
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,970
so it actually wasn't my fault

489
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,720
[Laughter]

490
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,199
never mind sorry guys

491
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,480
so on to the juice the the meat the the

492
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,919
you know the whatever the best part of

493
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,240
the talk the thing that you're here for

494
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,679
i actually didn't make sure the speaker

495
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,880
works i should figure that out in a

496
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
second but we'll get to that so on to

497
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,120
check ring

498
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,720
there we go

499
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,240
okay so this is the first ios job ios tv

500
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,120
os whatever anything i guess t2 as well

501
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
now

502
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,679
he did that stuff while i was working on

503
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,039
this talk i wasn't even like aware of

504
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,000
what he was working on until he

505
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,960
announced it

506
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
that's pretty cool

507
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,400
but it's the first ios jailbreak using

508
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,919
checkmate to

509
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,039
actually because

510
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,559
nothing else used it was just kind of

511
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,919
like a proof of concept like this is the

512
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,280
cool stuff you're capable but this

513
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,039
actually put it into production and

514
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,799
released it out into the public and

515
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,480
could be used end to end to do the

516
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,960
entire the whole magilla

517
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,640
at the beginning of it i was not doing

518
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
any coding because it didn't work on the

519
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,559
apple tv at all so my main job at that

520
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,840
point was just debugging

521
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
and if this plays automatically that's

522
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
going to be awesome because since it's

523
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,760
not loading through

524
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
a web server and it's loading locally

525
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,960
it's a little finicky

526
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,799
so give me one second to get this one

527
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,280
properly

528
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,280
so i'm actually going to use scikrift

529
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,039
right now while ssh going to get this

530
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,840
moving

531
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,840
there we

532
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,919
go so when i was first doing this i was

533
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,840
using an iphone 6s plus and i was

534
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,160
filming the screen of my tv to get them

535
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
debug output i'm not kidding you

536
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,400
but wait it gets better look at this

537
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,640
next log

538
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,290
[Laughter]

539
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,490
did you get any of that

540
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,799
[Laughter]

541
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,600
so

542
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
challenge accepted

543
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,000
uh the first thing that we ran into is

544
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
as part of stage two i can't get into

545
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,960
too much detail until it's completely

546
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,600
open but as part of stage three or at

547
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,120
the end of stage two somewhere in that

548
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,919
line

549
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,160
it looks for status check and it runs it

550
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,760
i don't remember exactly why it runs it

551
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,840
but it does it doesn't check to see her

552
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,280
i'm sorry it didn't check to see at the

553
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,159
time does this binary exist you assume

554
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,640
except they assumed it

555
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,000
existed i can talk on ios it'd be on tv

556
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,880
os didn't even think to look it did so

557
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,320
when you try to run a binary that wasn't

558
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,840
there based on the code and the way it

559
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,600
works it just completely shut down and

560
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,720
crashed and we had no idea why so once

561
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
that stump that once that uh roadblock

562
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,679
was

563
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
um

564
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,240
basic work sometimes once we got past

565
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
that roadblock

566
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,559
uh the next one was that for anything on

567
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,440
ios or tv os with arm64

568
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,679
can use could could i'm sorry could use

569
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,000
the same binary before this day you

570
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
could take an uh arm64 binary and then

571
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,960
just run it on tv os all the system if

572
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,159
all the frameworks are there and all the

573
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,400
dwld cache stuff is in place it would

574
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,200
work

575
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,840
flawlessly with 13 that all changed they

576
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,760
got very strict about this like you can

577
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
no longer do this and we didn't know

578
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,360
that so that was another one of those

579
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,960
things so like since we're doing this

580
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
while 13 is still kind of fresh and very

581
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
fresh for tv os it hadn't even been

582
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
jailbroken yet there's a lot of new

583
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,320
things we're looking into that we have

584
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,240
no clue about because nobody's figured

585
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,760
it out yet we're we're blazing that

586
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,000
trail to get to the next point tonight

587
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,640
that's next zone

588
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,440
um also i still actually have no jtag or

589
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,840
cereal on my apple tv for none so

590
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
debugging stuff especially when working

591
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,559
on check cream is very very very

592
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,650
challenging

593
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,080
[Music]

594
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,039
so when i finally got a monitor to do

595
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,720
this to film and that was like the main

596
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,840
reason i bought i mean it wasn't the

597
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
main reason but it was the reason i

598
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
bought it that day

599
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
it got a tiny bit better i mean this

600
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,039
part's still the same we hadn't made the

601
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,480
frame buffer smaller which is another

602
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,840
challenge because once it gets past the

603
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,960
screen you're like i don't know what

604
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
it's doing now

605
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,679
excuse me

606
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,840
so yeah once it's passed the asps

607
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,679
support then

608
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,039
does it get to the next step i mean we

609
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,960
know cause we see these next logs but

610
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,400
they're still not that much better

611
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,799
filming from this monitor so that was

612
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,600
still

613
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
very very challenging to

614
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
to debug

615
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,120
the next hurdle that i had to overcome

616
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,000
was

617
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,760
there's no loader for that we needed a

618
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,360
specific loader that was different from

619
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,200
ios for tv os and there's a few

620
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,720
different reasons this was the case and

621
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,640
i'm going to outline them now

622
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,840
so we

623
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,679
don't have multiple package managers

624
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,400
neato tv is the only game in town so

625
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
there's no need to have a bunch of

626
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,280
things to choose from if there's only

627
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,799
one like why are we going to make the

628
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,640
user press an extra button

629
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,480
if it's just gonna be what we choose for

630
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
them automatically anyway why even have

631
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,080
a button

632
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,440
there was also

633
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
is also a different payload and the

634
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
reason this is because things are just

635
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,960
different on apple tv you don't have the

636
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
same frameworks the ui doesn't work the

637
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
same you know the buttons are

638
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,400
essentially the same ui kit it's mostly

639
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,080
the same there's there's augmented parts

640
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,919
and there's also parts missing

641
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:48,640
so

642
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,000
all these things but like all these

643
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
things combined together

644
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,039
you shouldn't even try to combine the

645
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,280
code base for the ios and tbos loader

646
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,039
you're covered with a bunch of if defs

647
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,880
and it's just you know it's it's dirty

648
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,159
code and nobody really wants to do that

649
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,400
the unit the the post and installation

650
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,880
flow was different as well so on apple

651
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,760
tv the it still uses or not still

652
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,480
because ios never did it uses uh code

653
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,120
injection to get your icons showing up

654
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,200
on the screen it's messy i don't like it

655
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,640
but i still haven't found a way around

656
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,320
it yet so that's another thing that we

657
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,360
had to

658
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,679
overcome and figure out a way around

659
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,200
because as i'm going to mention later

660
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
tvos 13

661
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
added additional challenges to this

662
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,480
plate as well

663
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,520
and

664
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,039
on top of that i had to make a control

665
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,400
center widget so 13 tvs 13 introduced

666
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
control center

667
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,360
for the first time ever on apple tv

668
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,399
because we didn't have it before

669
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,760
so

670
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,440
i was like alright how do we get our

671
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,799
plugins there well one how do we write

672
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,159
plugins and two how do we get them in

673
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,919
there it's actually really easy you just

674
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,679
put them in this folder code's on them

675
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
they're good to go and the way i added

676
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,440
another domain is

677
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
normally you can only do system or

678
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,240
system library now you can do library i

679
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,600
felt it was good to keep them separate

680
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,960
what if somebody has names something

681
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,559
sleep or name something something else

682
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,240
apple's already used if you overwrite

683
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,279
them you're going to have a bad time

684
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,880
but i decided since i discovered this

685
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,559
around the same time let's make a check

686
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,919
brain widget

687
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,520
if the loader doesn't open up

688
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,039
automatically because it has to because

689
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,960
it's still invisible they can just go

690
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
into the control center open it up the

691
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,559
loader will kick off so it's kind of

692
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,480
like a stop gap but also it kind of

693
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
looks cool

694
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,840
it's obvious you can see the arrows

695
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
pointing to it

696
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,240
it stands out obviously

697
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,159
so the next step how do these things

698
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,240
work i took the sleep module that was

699
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,840
already in there that you probably saw

700
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,320
on the previous screen and i just class

701
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,840
dumped it and started reversing it it

702
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,919
was very simple i didn't imagine it was

703
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,640
harder to call one command sleep

704
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,240
whatever it does or whatever it did at

705
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,279
the time

706
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,279
and you have the content view i'm sorry

707
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,720
i'll start with the button style you

708
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
have three different small medium and

709
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
large the small is kind of a square that

710
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,440
doesn't even fill up the entire

711
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,600
the entire like control center section

712
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
and then the medium does fill up half of

713
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
it and then the large fills up the whole

714
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
thing

715
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,760
so for the check grain you don't really

716
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,919
need like the whole size so it was just

717
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,840
the the medium one

718
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
the next up is the content view

719
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,200
controller

720
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
and that just tells you what has what

721
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,559
does the button look like what image is

722
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,200
it showing it doesn't have text on it

723
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,480
things of that nature it's pretty

724
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
humdrum i made it a template image so if

725
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,240
you go between light and dark mode it'll

726
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,880
still work uh let's see here handle

727
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,320
action that's what happens when you

728
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,760
click the button

729
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,400
and dismiss after action so if you don't

730
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
have that as true the control center

731
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,559
will stay far not like stay up until it

732
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,000
automatically goes away from being idle

733
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
or whatever as long as you wanted to so

734
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
if you wanted to go away afterwards

735
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,158
dismas dismiss after action true

736
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,559
um okay yes that's right so about the

737
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,360
hidden section or the hidden issue

738
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,640
if you add any of these tags that

739
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,600
they

740
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
i honestly i tried to figure out this

741
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
entire process and it was just too much

742
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,039
reversing it too many boards board all

743
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,400
the boards they have like

744
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,159
springboard no sorry pine board

745
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,840
backboard headboard uh

746
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,120
splashboard let's see there's a few and

747
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,480
but all of those things it's not just

748
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,320
those things as applications they have

749
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,000
daemons they have frameworks they have

750
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
helpers they have so many different

751
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,120
things that you have to reverse to

752
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,520
figure out this process as far as i got

753
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,559
so pb application to backup a tiny bit

754
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,559
you don't have springboard on ios we

755
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,520
have

756
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,760
uh pine board and headboard those are

757
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,679
like two those two apps combined give

758
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,960
you everything you expect from

759
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,440
springboard but on the apple tv so pb

760
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
application obviously is board

761
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,000
application so the shared info store

762
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,240
uh the policy that you get from there

763
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,039
the exclusion tags are the exact same as

764
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,279
the pbs exclusion tags in ls application

765
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,279
workspace i think i hit pay dirt on this

766
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,039
at one point a while ago and i just

767
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,720
didn't remember exactly where it was so

768
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,039
i know that somehow those

769
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,600
variables those instances interact at

770
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,039
some point and that's where pine board

771
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,360
gets it from in ls application workspace

772
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
and it stores it in this array how it

773
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
gets there i haven't completely figured

774
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,559
that out yet

775
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,640
but hopefully once i do you know that'll

776
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,919
get rid of the whole code injection

777
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,480
thing the reason this is important is if

778
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,559
you have any of these three tags inside

779
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,120
of sb app tags in your info p list they

780
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,559
don't check anything about your

781
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,640
application except if it's code signed

782
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,480
so it'll get right through the door does

783
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,039
not matter but there's a caveat you

784
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,720
can't see it

785
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,440
kind of a bummer

786
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,840
so here's an actual demo i have to play

787
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,120
this video the same way i did the other

788
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,039
ones let's hope it works out oh did it

789
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,640
play itself nope okay

790
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,840
there we go

791
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,159
so this is what you see after you plug

792
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,440
in

793
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,799
or after you run check brain on your

794
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,200
apple tv once it reboots after you see

795
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
like the whole the the loader and

796
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,320
everything else and all the text up

797
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,480
there it goes to this very quickly like

798
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,760
you'll see your home screen from home

799
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,520
screen for one second and this will pop

800
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,000
up automatically start downloading

801
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,840
after it downloads once it's done the

802
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,000
first thing you'll see immediately well

803
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,600
not immediately but within like 30

804
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,840
seconds is neato tv

805
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,399
so end to end

806
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,120
end to end after you do this

807
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,559
the next thing that happens as far as

808
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,760
you know as a user you don't touch

809
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,200
anything you just get neato tv

810
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,720
immediately

811
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,960
so

812
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,880
i tried to make a pretty seamless

813
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,880
process

814
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,880
big money big money no i mean

815
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
stop

816
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,480
and there's the light mode version

817
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,600
[Applause]

818
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
thank you

819
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,159
so some of the issues that i mentioned a

820
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,880
moment ago with the ui cache obstacles

821
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,200
you still need code injection and on top

822
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,080
of that tv os 13 as i also mentioned

823
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
uh it had an extra challenge added it

824
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,240
had another layer of protection it went

825
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,919
through for you to be able to see the

826
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,320
app so i had to figure out what that was

827
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,640
thankfully it was really really really

828
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,640
easy

829
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,960
so as you see at the very top

830
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,120
that was the way i did it up to 12. so

831
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,039
nine through 12 this was sufficient with

832
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,399
the code injection i don't even think

833
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,919
nine or ten actually nine and ten didn't

834
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,760
need it at all 11 and 12 did and then 13

835
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,120
pbf info is enabled true done

836
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,199
[Music]

837
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,159
yeah i got to get there there's me being

838
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,360
a little dirty on twitter i had to get

839
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,640
believed

840
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,440
so

841
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,399
i was

842
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,000
one of the things that was another issue

843
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,919
with this because there's so many issues

844
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,320
piled on top of each other is substrate

845
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
mobile substrate we use that for code

846
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,000
injection again because on when i worked

847
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,480
on chimera and electro before this we

848
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,440
use substitute instead and comex made uh

849
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,799
an open source version of mobile

850
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,480
substrate that's called substitute

851
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,240
nobody ever really adapted till this

852
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,480
point so it's still missing it was and

853
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,919
still is missing things that mobile

854
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,399
substrate had had long hand

855
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,159
but since i couldn't get any kind of

856
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,520
code injection working because that all

857
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,960
worked based on stuff i'm not going to

858
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,600
get into today there's just too much

859
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,679
i had to use this old method which was

860
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,080
possible again to get code injection

861
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,960
working

862
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,120
so i took the pine board app renamed it

863
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,760
to pine board bro and then made into a

864
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
shell script in places that was

865
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,240
executable and then when i re-sprung

866
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,840
everything it would just give me code

867
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,760
injection it would work again this is

868
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,279
something we hadn't been able to do in a

869
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,960
long time because nobody really bothered

870
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,200
to do all the patches necessary we

871
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,640
didn't need to make as many i don't

872
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,399
think just because the virtue of the

873
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,039
awesomeness of

874
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,640
checkmate so 10 16 19 it was the very

875
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
very first day that check green had

876
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,200
worked on an apple tv for and it was

877
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,880
awesome it was a lot it was a labor of

878
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,480
love that took a very long time and it

879
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
was a very exciting day

880
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,480
the very next day we decided to or i

881
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,039
decided to tease the pins that we had

882
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,559
found so

883
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,480
based on some stuff i'll kind of get a

884
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,799
little bit into in a moment we found out

885
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,679
that the ethernet port has a trap door

886
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,640
inside of it that has some pins exposed

887
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,039
that some special cables can get to or

888
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,640
some enterprising people can figure out

889
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,880
how to do stuff with otherwise

890
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,440
and it turns out this is from the ifixit

891
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,519
teardown they completely miss these pins

892
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,519
these pins are on the ethernet port and

893
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,240
they connect inside of that trapdoor but

894
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,760
we didn't give that whole reveal at this

895
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,200
point we just teased these pins and

896
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,559
people just started guessing because it

897
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,039
was fun

898
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,000
on the 22nd we had the first diag the

899
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,039
first

900
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,960
it wasn't serial but we had some kind of

901
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,559
diagnostic output like when you plug

902
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,480
something in an eye recovery and you you

903
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,399
boot comes up or it's not even in

904
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,760
recovery mode it has to be in some maybe

905
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,919
dfu in dfu mode you'll get this whole

906
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,279
printout that you'll see in a minute

907
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,840
that says i boot your serial number cpid

908
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,559
bb ddid all that stuff so that was the

909
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,320
first time at that point we also got

910
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,920
that as well on the 4k

911
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
[Music]

912
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,039
let's see oh and the code code injection

913
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,760
i showed on the previous slide

914
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,919
and this is probably going to be my

915
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,360
favorite part but i can't talk as much

916
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,039
about it as i'd like to

917
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,320
so allegedly on this day uh a sand paper

918
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,760
a piece of sandpaper and it's not like

919
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,640
one of those things that you

920
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,399
professionally put down on it an actual

921
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,320
piece of sandpaper might have gone

922
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
directly onto a nand inside of an apple

923
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,279
tv

924
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,720
allegedly to get it into dfu mode

925
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,519
to back up a tiny bit normally on any

926
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,480
apple tv up until the 4k

927
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,440
you press menu play pause on this on the

928
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,039
serial mode as illustrated in the

929
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,600
picture to get it into dfu mode as long

930
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
as you're plugged into usb which is also

931
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,360
issued because they don't give nearly

932
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
took it away

933
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,559
but as long as you're in there and it's

934
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,799
powered on that should kick it into dfu

935
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,080
mode on the 4k it does not

936
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,919
so we found out you can get into

937
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,240
recovery mode still with this redacted

938
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,399
device that i really can't get into um

939
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,039
that i may or may not have

940
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,919
um you could get into recovery using a

941
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,760
special version of the bimobile device

942
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,519
that nikias had put together that had

943
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,120
wi-fi support he hadn't released it at

944
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,360
the time he may have by now i'm honestly

945
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,480
not sure

946
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,840
we figured out it does see it in

947
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,760
recovery mode but the next question

948
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
doesn't see it in dfu mode once we know

949
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,679
it sees it in dfu mode you know game

950
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,120
over we own this thing for life

951
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,080
when we did it we did verify that dfu

952
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,200
mode worked i guess i should have said

953
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,600
that too

954
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
so a friend of mine that follows me on

955
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,039
twitter decided if you're not familiar

956
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,039
with the virgin and chad meme format i'm

957
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,399
hoping everybody is i don't have to

958
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,000
explain it do i

959
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,840
okay nobody said anything okay good

960
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,679
so this kind of explains itself red snow

961
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,919
was a way that things were jailbroken

962
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,360
back in the day that nobody really uses

963
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,799
anymore so they thought it'd be funny if

964
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,200
that was the verb virgin and the chad

965
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
was supposedly me supposedly sanding

966
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,620
dance

967
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,120
[Laughter]

968
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,320
so then from here i decided to have some

969
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,079
fun with radian he is the head of

970
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,480
security for apple i think software and

971
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,760
hardware i could be wrong i know

972
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,399
definitely hardware though um

973
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,639
and you know like have a little fun with

974
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,480
them show them a picture of stuff in dfu

975
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
mode add the little eyeball emojis those

976
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,918
come in later too because i needed those

977
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,118
later to find these tweets

978
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,199
the next thing here you can see there's

979
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,800
the diagnostics i was speaking about

980
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,639
earlier so you have

981
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,719
the you know the iboot info you can you

982
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,399
can verify based on all these things

983
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,239
except the redacted serial number that

984
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,800
this is indeed an apple tv 4k in dfu

985
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,119
mode

986
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,199
from here you can see the first time

987
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,280
that little steve ran it on the 4k and

988
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,119
if you actually take a good look you can

989
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,800
kind of see his outline

990
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,879
like taking the picture

991
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,079
and then of course

992
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,359
i had to point out my name they're very

993
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,400
tiny

994
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,079
there was oh and you can also see here

995
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,920
this is a good illustration remember how

996
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,839
it was really big when the frame buffer

997
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,440
like kind of went off the screen this is

998
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,680
how we solve that issue make it smaller

999
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,880
so moving on to the 4k stuff and little

1000
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,040
steve and uh some people from

1001
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,400
celebrating i hate snow and some other

1002
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,720
people put amazing amounts of effort

1003
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,960
into isolating where these pins were

1004
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,240
because there's a ton of different pins

1005
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,640
we don't have any kind of um diagnostics

1006
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,320
not diagnostics any kind of blueprints

1007
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,280
on how these things work there's a

1008
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,880
proper term for that i can't think of we

1009
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,079
didn't have any of that stuff like none

1010
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,480
of that stuff is leaked as we know for

1011
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,119
any of the apple tvs

1012
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,960
so it was kind of just like hey test

1013
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,200
this pin test this pen test this pin

1014
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,720
it's very challenging and he went

1015
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,480
through amazing amount of work and he

1016
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,480
did apple tvs to get what he did

1017
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,440
as you can see here so this was him

1018
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,240
actually spilling the beans on if you

1019
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,079
pull that down there you can see the

1020
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,520
trapdoor there's the pins and

1021
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,839
presumably we can get dfu and everything

1022
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,800
else through these things we just

1023
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,920
haven't figured out how yet

1024
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,079
this is an example of his first

1025
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,240
generation of the breakout board and all

1026
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,480
this does i say all this does is if it's

1027
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,560
like a small thing you press that button

1028
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,320
you get in dfu you run check green you

1029
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,800
have a jailbroken 4k

1030
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,560
this is the first version of any of this

1031
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,880
that has ever worked or ever existed we

1032
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,480
obviously want to move more towards

1033
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,880
something that doesn't have the

1034
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,520
necessity to solder stuff or take it

1035
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,280
apart at all you know we won't be able

1036
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,440
to actually utilize that port that we

1037
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,200
teased just a moment ago

1038
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,160
so i'm literally just going to read

1039
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,280
these verbatim because he wrote this

1040
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
slide for me so i don't even need to

1041
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,640
write read it they all just kind of just

1042
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,240
go through it and say what i can about

1043
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,920
it but

1044
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,359
the first things that he was doing to

1045
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,240
trying to get into dfu mode didn't

1046
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,160
succeed to get it into dfu in any kind

1047
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,720
of useful way at all it i think it was

1048
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,320
aop that would get in the way so you

1049
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,160
would boot into dfu and then within i

1050
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,800
think 10 to 15 seconds it would panic

1051
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,720
and then just go straight back to user

1052
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,960
land to just normal mode

1053
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,640
so i think that yeah the third time it

1054
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,920
was the third time that he did that he

1055
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,359
had two different times the first one no

1056
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,280
dfu the second one it was an

1057
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,760
illegitimate dfu and then the third was

1058
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,320
to use the pcie set and nvme or nvme

1059
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,240
to enter dfu with no discernible side

1060
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,680
effects so this is the way that he

1061
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,119
figured out these are the things that

1062
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,800
you need to touch in this fashion with

1063
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,280
whatever crazy technical equipment to

1064
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,359
get this thing in dfu mode

1065
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,359
any further technical explanation we'll

1066
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,640
have to be on another day when he gives

1067
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,440
a talk about it and as we move towards

1068
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,359
products that will be easier for people

1069
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,560
to use so you don't need a soldering

1070
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,800
iron keep your eye on guardian app.com

1071
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,000
for more information on that

1072
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,480
so the aftermath i was absolutely

1073
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,280
consumed with tv os 13 support because

1074
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
we were working on the jailbreak at the

1075
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,119
same time that i was just being

1076
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,119
introduced to how tvos 13 is different

1077
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,960
in the first place i had a ton of things

1078
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,040
to do i had a lot of stuff to update

1079
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,160
there was much work to be done

1080
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,480
so part of that was the fact that

1081
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,760
elektra and chimera used substitute for

1082
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,960
code injection but substrate was used on

1083
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,040
check brain so i had to i didn't have to

1084
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,280
split into two separate apps repos but

1085
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,200
running an app repo really isn't my

1086
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
specialty i can do it i've been doing it

1087
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,960
for a long time but i'm no expert at it

1088
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,880
like sam banger like he's a he's much

1089
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,040
bigger much better expert at this and

1090
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,200
that's why i tried and i actually didn't

1091
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,359
try i started to migrate over to

1092
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,200
electric products because at that point

1093
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,960
i don't have to manage app and d package

1094
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,240
anymore any of those things with the

1095
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,320
repo just my own packages and just the

1096
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,599
stuff for the store

1097
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,599
and also at that point then it would be

1098
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,119
merged with however the rest of check

1099
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,720
rain works because they use his repo i

1100
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,560
want to use his repo too there's just a

1101
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,760
lot of things to sort through and i

1102
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,280
don't want to rush it out because i'm

1103
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,400
not doing that anymore

1104
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,119
that's empty

1105
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,160
so next slide

1106
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,280
so here because up to this point with

1107
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,720
apple tv hacking there's been other

1108
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,200
people involved but i've kind of not to

1109
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,400
be like

1110
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,680
you know boast about it but i kind of

1111
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,839
single-handedly kept the thing alive for

1112
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,440
a very long time releasing most of the

1113
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,520
projects on my own

1114
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,440
so at this point since all this stuff

1115
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,119
had happened a few other people started

1116
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,800
getting interested now we have theming

1117
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,119
as you saw when the big reveal came from

1118
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,720
the apple tv open there was theming on

1119
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,119
the apple tv so spark dev introduced

1120
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,599
that he ported his version of his

1121
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,240
snowboard theming engine over to tvos

1122
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,160
and he's done a beautiful job with it it

1123
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,440
still needs a little bit of tweaking for

1124
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
tvos 13 but for the most part it works

1125
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,800
perfectly

1126
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,320
and then i i don't know if this is going

1127
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,680
to demo properly hopefully the audio is

1128
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,599
going to work let me plug it in but the

1129
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,040
next slide is going to be me demoing

1130
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,640
something from uh

1131
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,079
i killed apple called uh harlem shake tv

1132
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,920
which is

1133
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,760
only a demo can explain it oh sorry i

1134
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,359
skipped over my class part

1135
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,400
so

1136
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,920
i've been talking about this for a long

1137
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
time and i've been promising and i it is

1138
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,520
still coming just more things have come

1139
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,839
up i'm going to be teaching a free class

1140
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,200
on everything i know how to do on the

1141
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,640
apple tv and everything i've ever known

1142
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
how to do completely free no strings

1143
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,760
attached

1144
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,359
hopefully as soon as possible hopefully

1145
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,480
this month

1146
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,319
by latest next month it will absolutely

1147
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,280
start

1148
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,880
it i don't know the full format of it

1149
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,480
yet and this talk isn't about that but i

1150
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,400
will say briefly it'll probably be like

1151
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,560
a video every couple of weeks and then a

1152
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,319
forum and

1153
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,000
maybe discord or one of those kind of

1154
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,599
things where you can just group together

1155
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,440
i'll have time every couple of days that

1156
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,680
i'll devote just to that to answer

1157
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
questions so that's kind of something

1158
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,200
that i want to launch and i want to let

1159
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,400
people know about it because i really

1160
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,440
want to get people involved

1161
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,319
okay so instead of showing a video here

1162
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,720
i want to actually demo it in action

1163
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,319
and i don't think this is paired right

1164
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,839
now so give me one second to make sure

1165
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,400
that's going to work

1166
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
oh it is okay now it just connected okay

1167
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,240
so hopefully

1168
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
i'll put this in here

1169
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,440
so hopefully

1170
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,839
this just

1171
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,560
works fingers crossed

1172
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,599
it is not we are not getting audio

1173
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,359
oh there it is

1174
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,640
so i'll just have to do whatever he did

1175
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,879
in that movie

1176
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,119
i didn't plug it i'm sorry i'll plug it

1177
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,240
back in

1178
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,800
it's almost over anyway

1179
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,200
i should use the mic sorry

1180
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,440
[Music]

1181
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,580
you get the idea though

1182
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,400
[Music]

1183
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,240
it's not useful but it's cool as hell

1184
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,560
and the next slide was just questions so

1185
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,680
questions

1186
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,359
oh sorry thank you for everything thank

1187
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,400
you for the confidence thank you for

1188
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,960
bringing me here guardian love you all

1189
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,960
questions

1190
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,839
one of the things i wanted to do is one

1191
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,560
more thing is i bought a raspberry pi

1192
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,240
for this i wanted to make it so i could

1193
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,720
have an untether on the apple tv using a

1194
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
raspberry pi because it's totally

1195
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,839
possible but i just didn't get it done

1196
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:38,960
in time

1197
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,920
so

1198
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,359
that's going to be one solution

1199
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,079
obviously the that isn't the best size

1200
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,680
of something i mean it's okay for the

1201
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,359
apple tv to tuck behind something you

1202
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,800
don't have to worry about looking at it

1203
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,079
but obviously you want something more

1204
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,599
minimal and we're gonna work towards

1205
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,440
that but we gotta get it working in some

1206
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
form first proof of concept and then

1207
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,400
move forward from there

1208
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,960
i don't see why it couldn't work

1209
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,720
i haven't played with it but

1210
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,839
completely feasible

1211
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,680
for check

1212
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,200
i think like

1213
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,599
30 megs 40 mags something like that if

1214
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,839
even that

1215
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,280
good question i'm hoping we can use some

1216
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,720
of that amazing text loading stuff we

1217
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,439
heard about earlier

1218
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,520
all right awesome so bringing a few

1219
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,160
advice schedules

1220
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,440
again round of applause

1221
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,119
come on
