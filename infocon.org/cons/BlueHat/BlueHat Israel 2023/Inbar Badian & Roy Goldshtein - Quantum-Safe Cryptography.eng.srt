00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,700
[Music]

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,440
thank you

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,620
[Music]

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,900
so hi everyone

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,440
my name is I'm a senior PM in the

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,560
security CTO office of Microsoft leading

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,660
strategic initiatives from concept to

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,599
execution and unfortunately my partner

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,760
for this lecture today couldn't join us

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,740
today because he's expecting a new baby

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,059
so super exciting yeah

12
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:38,760
so boy couldn't join us but he's with us

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,460
and today we're going to talk about how

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,500
quantum computers are going to shake up

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,140
the world of encryption does anyone know

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,960
about the risk that quantum computers

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,079
have to encryption raise your hands

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,300
wow okay

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,239
um do you know why

20
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,500
okay and do you know why now

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,199
why should we talk about this now

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,900
raise your hand if you know the answer

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,580
okay so we're going to talk about that

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,680
what the heck is quantum computer and

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,659
why it's going to affect our encryption

26
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,280
and what we can do already today

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
and first of all I just want to want a

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
disclaimer it's not going to be a

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,880
cryptography lecture we're not going to

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,979
get into the the math and the technicals

31
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,780
are going too much

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,659
um yeah I know I know but um you have

33
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,939
some references to read about after the

34
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,740
lecture and of course that we can

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,680
discuss it more outside but I just want

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,380
to set the stage and and make sure that

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,820
we're all aligned with the basic

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,380
terminology related to encryption

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,060
because you know we're talking about

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,479
risk to encryption so let's understand

41
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,540
why it's so critical to understand the

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,220
threats that quantum computers have on

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,320
encryption and what it means

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,780
so I'm sure that you all know it but

45
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,119
encryption is the process of converting

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,420
data as we can read it to an unreadable

47
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,699
format and basically if we don't want

48
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,979
anyone to to see what we're saying to

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,959
see our secrets we'll use encryption

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,739
methods using mathematical algorithms

51
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:18,660
and we're using encryption basically

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,360
everywhere in our communication in our

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,060
when we're texting over WhatsApp when

54
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,080
we're doing payment actions so basically

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,120
we have encryption everywhere and

56
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,700
without encryption we couldn't do most

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,819
of the actions involving data and

58
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,000
specifically sensitive data

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,500
so

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,959
there are two types for encryption and

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,459
again I'm sure that you're all familiar

62
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,379
with this but just to set a stage and

63
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,780
make sure we're aligned so let's take a

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,819
look at symmetric encryption and

65
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,680
asymmetric encryption which are critical

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,900
to this lecture

67
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,239
so symmetric encryption

68
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,879
um also known as known as shared key

69
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,040
encryption

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,019
it's where I want to send now an email

71
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,120
to my colleague saying that I have

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,220
chocolate in my office but I want to say

73
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,780
it secretly so I'll set a key or a

74
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,120
password and then I'll send the email

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,099
and my colleague will have to use the

76
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,040
same password as I said it so this will

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,379
be our shared key to exchange

78
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,679
information securely

79
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,340
asymmetric encryption on the other hand

80
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,620
has two keys now I have the public key

81
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,780
and I have the private key and now if I

82
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,720
want to send my message to the recipient

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,260
to my colleague I will encrypt my data

84
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,680
with the recipient's public key and then

85
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,140
when they want to open my message they

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,900
will use their private key and the email

87
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,720
software will see if the keys are

88
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,780
correlated and if so if it's true then

89
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,940
my colleague will be able to read the

90
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,440
message and come to my office at

91
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,000
chocolate

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,440
so

93
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,560
two types of encryption but now the

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,720
elephant in the room what's quantum

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,980
computer right

96
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,439
who knows the answer

97
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,480
okay okay so we have some people who

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,760
knows what's quantum computer but let's

99
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,500
have a deep dive

100
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,560
so quantum computers are going to change

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,959
the world and change humanity and

102
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,419
everywhere everything we know today and

103
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,820
that's because a quantum computer is the

104
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,040
computers that use a quantum mechanical

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,199
phenomena such entitlement or

106
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
superposition which I'm sure that you

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,699
all heard those those terms

108
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,100
superposition for example means that a

109
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,320
practical can be in two states or or

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,840
even more in the same time allowing

111
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,180
those computers to perform operations on

112
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,660
data much faster and in a much optimized

113
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,820
way than what we can do today with our

114
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,440
with our computers with our classical

115
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,199
computers and not only that the

116
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,180
computational power of quantum computers

117
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,520
allow them to solve some of the most

118
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,280
hardest questions that we have today for

119
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,979
classical computers and those hard

120
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,040
questions are currently the basis for

121
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,500
everything we know about encryption

122
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,919
so let's understand a little more what

123
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,479
quantum computers allows us to do

124
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,020
because it has so many benefits to our

125
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,600
lives and to some of the um the areas

126
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
that we are all affected by

127
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,539
so basically quantum computers will

128
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,539
allow us to simulate faster if we

129
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,840
discuss superposition the fact that

130
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,220
practicals can be in several States at

131
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,919
the same time we can now simulate more

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,500
situation at the same time so we can

133
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,300
solve some of the more complex questions

134
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,520
in a bit in the ambiguity that we have

135
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,080
today around

136
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,100
um several several questions that that

137
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,479
we can solve today with classical

138
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,699
computers

139
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,500
also it will allow us to solve

140
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,840
optimization questions and optimization

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,720
problems so optimization basically is to

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
find the result the solution based on

143
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
set of constraints and a requested

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,280
outcome and today optimization problems

145
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,199
affect our business decisions our supply

146
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
chain management and and more and in

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,380
order to have those those problems

148
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,300
solved in a faster way in a more

149
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,319
optimized way we are using what it calls

150
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,479
Quantum inspired optimization emulating

151
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,520
the existing Quantum system that we have

152
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,580
today to use what we got from those

153
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,400
experiments that we already have and to

154
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,740
and to the day that we'll have strong

155
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,600
enough quantum computers to run those

156
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,740
experiments we wish to have those

157
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,000
optimization problem solved in a faster

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,280
way

159
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,860
and also machine learning we see how it

160
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,860
Revolution as the our lives today so of

161
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,259
course that if we will if we will will

162
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,199
be able to run those algorithms on the

163
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,419
strong enough quantum computer we will

164
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,400
be able to get much more information

165
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,039
than we have today and who knows what

166
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,900
else we can do

167
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,979
it will affect chemistry biology the

168
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,600
traffic jams that we have today if we

169
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,060
solve optimization problems

170
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,240
um climate change depends on whether

171
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,440
forecasting that might improve with

172
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,599
quantum computers and also as we said

173
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,380
more knowledge and capabilities out of

174
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,699
optimized machine learnings

175
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,660
so so many good things but it will also

176
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,599
affect cryptography for the good and for

177
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,220
the bad

178
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,979
quantum computers are going to pose a

179
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,620
threat to asymmetric encryption

180
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,280
and basically it will break everything

181
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,560
that we know today that is based on

182
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,500
public encryption for example if we want

183
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,319
to connect today to the internet we're

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,080
using SSL or TLS to connect to the

185
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,099
browser but it will it based on public

186
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,520
encryption and also

187
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,180
uh it's known today that most of the

188
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,220
most of the communication protocols that

189
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,960
we have are based on RSA and

190
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,479
diffie-hellman which are

191
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,880
um which will be Break by Broken by

192
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,520
quantum computers and today we have two

193
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,340
Quantum algorithms that we know that can

194
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,400
work and can break and pose a threat uh

195
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,039
to our encryption by running them on

196
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,259
quantum computer we have Shore's

197
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,319
algorithm related to factoring problem

198
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,899
and basically sure's algorithm running

199
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,360
on a quantum computer will be able to

200
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,599
find factor to larger numbers in less

201
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,000
steps than what we can even imagine

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,880
today with classic computer in within a

203
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
feasible time

204
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,680
so this will pose a huge threat to

205
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
everything we know for RSA and

206
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,080
diffie-hellman

207
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,180
the second algorithm is Grover algorithm

208
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,160
and I'm not going to get too deep into

209
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,680
into the explanation because we do have

210
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
a solution today for Grover algorithm

211
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,720
basically Grover allows us by running it

212
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,540
on a quantum computer

213
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,720
to perform a search operation

214
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,000
in an unordered list and find the

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,060
specific items that we're looking for

216
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,560
posing a problem to

217
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,000
um to hush

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,240
so the solution that we have today that

219
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,459
we can double the key or the half size

220
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,459
so it's not a threat that we're looking

221
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,680
at now and we also have some tools I

222
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,839
have it in the references that you can

223
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,540
see what's the size of a key or a hash

224
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,959
that is is both to the stress of quantum

225
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,080
computers but we're good with that so

226
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,700
the main problem is asymmetric

227
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,000
encryption

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,160
and luckily today is the quantum

229
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,920
computers that we have are too small to

230
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,720
perform those calculations and to

231
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,300
actually break the cryptography that we

232
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,839
have and usually quantum computers today

233
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,779
are used to academic purposes and and

234
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,240
very specific

235
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,880
missions that we're using it but there's

236
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,459
the questions by tones of researchers

237
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,920
around the world when a quantum computer

238
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,279
will be able to break our encryption and

239
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,200
some of the optimistic researchers say

240
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,480
that it's going to be in two or three

241
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,120
years several say that it's going to be

242
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,640
between 5 to 10 and others say that's

243
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,480
way too long it's going to be over more

244
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,459
than a decade so this is the question

245
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,580
that is here and a lot of researchers

246
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,220
are trying to understand this from

247
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,860
different places

248
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,240
but it poses questions to everyone

249
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
handling with security today so if it's

250
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,700
a future question and if the threat is

251
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,519
not today should I care about quantum

252
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,220
computers now or should I just be aware

253
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,880
of it and okay it'll it'll be good and

254
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,399
the answer is we should care about us

255
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,920
now because

256
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,440
Quantum attacks can be happened today

257
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,820
because they are more and more concerns

258
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,940
that eventually there are attackers who

259
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,860
already record the data that we have

260
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,320
today everything and specifically

261
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,180
focusing on long-term long-term

262
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,000
information for example health records

263
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,220
or government information that is super

264
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,920
sensitive and also on all of our

265
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,980
hardware and iot devices that when

266
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,680
implemented in the field it will stay

267
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,680
there and even much after we'll have

268
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,200
those quantum computers so those

269
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,620
attackers recorded now in

270
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,140
wishing that when they will have a

271
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,940
quantum computer that is strong enough

272
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,860
they will be able to break the

273
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,839
encryption that we have today and read

274
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,180
all our information and this attack is

275
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,339
called Harvest now decree plater and

276
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,899
there's a lot of attention around it

277
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,399
right now

278
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,920
so it's important to think about it even

279
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,219
now

280
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,480
so

281
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,700
post Quantum cryptography

282
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,620
it sounds like we don't have anything to

283
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,860
do right everyone records our data and

284
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,860
all the information that we have and we

285
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,420
don't even know when quantum computers

286
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,100
will be available it might be next year

287
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,519
so what should we do and we have a

288
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,500
solution today and it's post Quantum

289
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,959
cryptography algorithms anyone knows

290
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,800
what what it means

291
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,980
okay I see only a few hands here so

292
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,660
basically post Quantum cryptography

293
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,459
algorithms is an emerging field

294
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,200
it's type of algorithms types of

295
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,899
encryption that designed to be resistant

296
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,660
both to classical and to quantum

297
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,040
computers and basically it was it was a

298
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,380
mechanism that was known back back in

299
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,720
the past for example Michael is

300
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,060
code-based cryptosystem if anyone knows

301
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,260
it so it was designed back then but it

302
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,019
wasn't very popular so everyone designed

303
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,779
the infrastructure and I.T systems to

304
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,720
support RSA and the fielman which were

305
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,959
very popular back then and now

306
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,839
we need to change all the encryption

307
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,240
that we have today because we used only

308
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,600
rsnd helmet and not other algorithms so

309
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,480
now all the algorithms that we're using

310
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,860
may be broken by quantum computer

311
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,720
the pqc algorithm fall into two types

312
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,339
there's algorithms related to key

313
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,680
encapsulation mechanism related to

314
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,800
public key encryption what we mostly

315
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,899
worried about in in terms of the

316
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,339
communication protocols that we have

317
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,380
today but we also have algorithms

318
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,000
related to the signature related to

319
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,480
authentication and authenticity

320
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,420
also the common ground for all those

321
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,560
algorithms is that they all fall into

322
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,100
several families of heart problems and

323
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,600
just to make sure we're aligned on this

324
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,579
when I'm saying heart problems it's the

325
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,200
heart the problems that we can solve

326
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,360
today by classical computers in a

327
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,060
feasible time so it's just so we we all

328
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,000
be aligned on that and those families of

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,060
heart problems are currently known to be

330
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,639
hard for quantum computers as well so

331
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,339
that's why it's an opportunity for us to

332
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,920
find those algorithms coming from these

333
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,320
families of algorithms so we can we can

334
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,639
see here lattice called exogony and more

335
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,639
and in order to start using those pqc

336
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,100
algorithms we can just start using it

337
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,560
like that I mean we can but it's not

338
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,060
necessarily safe

339
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,760
so nice the National Institutes of

340
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,980
standards and Technology started the

341
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,060
process back in 2016 to have those

342
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,360
algorithms standardized and to to make

343
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,600
sure that we all use it not because we

344
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,540
want but because we must use them as a

345
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,000
protocol so the process started with

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,079
researchers from all across the world

347
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,860
sending algorithms from different

348
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,560
families most of the the algorithms were

349
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,019
sent based on lattice and we'll discuss

350
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,779
it in in a minute and there were three

351
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,579
rounds

352
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,820
in those three rounds there were several

353
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,260
tests to uh to test the performance to

354
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,060
test how to integrate those algorithms

355
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,180
if it's feasible if it's not and there

356
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,740
were several algorithms that were broken

357
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,620
that were proved to be solved in a

358
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,959
feasible time so they were not hard

359
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,740
anymore and now we're we're started the

360
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,680
first round with several algorithms that

361
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,500
are currently the leading candidates but

362
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,600
the final round will allow us to find

363
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,820
more algorithms from different families

364
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,459
as I said most of the algorithms that I

365
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,620
have that we have today as you can see

366
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,880
here are based on lattice so now we're

367
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,860
trying to find to diversify the

368
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,620
algorithms that we have and to find more

369
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,959
to make sure that we have more

370
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,440
opportunities in case someone break the

371
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,360
the existing algorithms that we have now

372
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,639
based on lattice and kyber is the

373
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,440
leading one for encryption deletion was

374
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,480
then leading one for signature

375
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,459
and as we said there were several

376
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,800
algorithms that were broken

377
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,380
unfortunately and some of them were very

378
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,240
promising and it was very heartbreaking

379
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,120
to hear that they were broken and think

380
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,920
about that that the entire process

381
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,740
should be done by end of 2024 so we

382
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,740
don't have enough time and only last

383
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,279
year one of the leading algorithms Psych

384
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,120
was broken by two researchers that were

385
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,000
able to prove that it can be solved in a

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,600
feasible time

387
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,720
and let's get into the uh the story of

388
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,060
Psych just to understand how an

389
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,520
algorithm was actually a candidate to be

390
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
a post Quantum algorithm and why it was

391
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,160
broken

392
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,319
so psych was designed in collaboration

393
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,540
between researchers from Microsoft

394
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,380
Amazon and several universities

395
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,540
basically bringing everyone together

396
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,199
which is amazing and

397
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,740
this algorithm refers to a family of

398
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,319
um to a family of postgraduate

399
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,179
algorithms that relate to diffie-hellman

400
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:36,360
and the idea here was to use the same

401
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,179
approach that we have for DPL man and to

402
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,840
just transition it to isogony graph and

403
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,240
we'll see it in a minute to harden the

404
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,940
question to harden the problem and to

405
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,679
make it a post Quantum algorithm

406
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,860
and the the graph that you see here

407
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,760
which is horrible that's an example of

408
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,539
of a small super singular exogenic graph

409
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,200
okay that the idea here is to find a

410
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,660
path between two points and to find

411
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,419
eventually a mutual point which will be

412
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,299
the secret key and we'll see it in a

413
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,960
minute but you can understand why one of

414
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,559
the the candidates to be heart problem

415
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,880
and as I said in 2022 this algorithm

416
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,760
that was the superhero the Chuck Norris

417
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,480
of the the pqc algorithm was broken and

418
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,940
um let's let's see why

419
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,820
so basically the idea here was based on

420
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,640
how we exchange information on top of

421
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,419
insecure Channel which is the uh the the

422
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,120
idea behind difi Hellman and back then

423
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,419
it was a question of all cryptographers

424
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,960
in 1970 trying to understand how we can

425
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,900
solve this question and luckily Diffie

426
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,299
and Hellman found us the answer when

427
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,580
coming up with the solution of

428
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,860
exchanging

429
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,440
exchanging information with the difi

430
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,620
helmet methodology and let's um we will

431
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,360
not get into the algorithm but just to

432
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,419
understand how it works basically each

433
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,580
user the sender and the recipient choose

434
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,980
a number a private number

435
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,220
they take a public number and again the

436
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,679
the communication is insecure so we have

437
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,780
to think about a way that if we're not

438
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,760
meeting each other physically we can

439
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,039
just switch a key between us we need to

440
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,520
find a way to have a common secret a

441
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,059
common way to change information so by

442
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,100
choosing a secret number and a public

443
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,820
number each each of the the parties the

444
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,260
sender and the recipient perform

445
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,440
calculations on the numbers again and

446
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,020
again and sending the information until

447
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,919
finally that they find the result which

448
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,320
is a common number and it's promised

449
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,299
based on how diffie-hellman works that

450
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,299
the final number will be the same number

451
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:07,320
which will act as the shared key and

452
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,059
then we're back again to symmetric

453
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,460
encryption

454
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,679
so Psych

455
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,179
this is

456
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,120
um I love this graph

457
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,460
it shows how the approach for

458
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,280
diffie-hellman was thrown to an isogony

459
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,340
graph to basically when Allison Bob

460
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,720
wants to interact with each other

461
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,780
eventually they want to find a walk to a

462
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,000
mutual point in the end which this

463
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,220
Mutual point will act at their secret

464
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,799
key but as we said before there are

465
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,299
several calculations that we need to do

466
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,299
in the middle and to exchange between us

467
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,760
so based on those calculation and the

468
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,400
exchange of information and the metadata

469
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,980
that we had two mathematizations were

470
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,580
able to break psych by using a

471
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,880
mathematical theory on top of the method

472
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,679
points that they that they got from

473
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,900
Psych and to show how they can solve

474
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,780
this find this usual point in a feasible

475
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,320
time so stock is not relevant anymore as

476
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,179
you remember we need to find problems

477
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,960
that are not solved by either classical

478
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,179
or quantum computer in a visible time

479
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,100
so psych was broken and we see more and

480
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,919
more pqc algorithms getting broken what

481
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,120
can we do

482
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,919
and

483
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,900
basically I don't have a concrete answer

484
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,080
to that but I do have some steps that we

485
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,140
need to take and the first one is to

486
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,059
remember that as we said at the

487
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,220
beginning pqc is an emerging field post

488
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,500
Quantum cryptography it's only in the

489
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,940
beginning and it's one of the hottest

490
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,400
topic right now in security because we

491
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
all understand that we will have to

492
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,299
transition all our cryptography to

493
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,640
support post Quantum cryptography as

494
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,620
well we can just use RSA and

495
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,720
diffie-hellman as we have today

496
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,840
so what I suggest to do here is to

497
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,700
explore the topic to be aware of not

498
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,620
just the development of quantum

499
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,200
computers how it how it's going to

500
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,539
evolve and what's the timeline for that

501
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,000
because it changed every year with the

502
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,280
rapid development that we have but also

503
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,100
to track after the process of needs the

504
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,840
process of the research that we have for

505
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,960
pqc and even be an active part of this

506
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,360
researchers from all over the world are

507
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,820
participating now to break to try and

508
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,820
break the existing algorithm so raise

509
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,760
awareness and not just to you but to all

510
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,120
to everyone around you to this topic

511
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,100
also we need to remember that the

512
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,780
protocol the crypto protocols that we

513
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,480
have today are mainly to reduce the

514
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,720
problems that we have analyzing complex

515
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
systems but it just brings us to a

516
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,460
problem where we need to handle

517
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,039
mathematical problems which is not easy

518
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,700
at all but it's simpler than handling

519
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,799
with those complex systems

520
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,659
but even with that we need to remember

521
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,080
that crypto systems need time and need

522
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,179
people people trying to break their

523
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,340
system again and again and to break

524
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,320
those algorithms to provide us

525
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,140
confidence that they are difficult they

526
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,600
can't be solved and on top of that we'll

527
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
understand that our systems remain

528
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,100
secured as much as possible but we can

529
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,120
guarantee 100 security for our systems

530
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,539
and lastly because we understand that

531
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,220
we'll need to transition crypto and it's

532
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,780
not going to be the last transition

533
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,880
we've been through several transitions

534
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,280
of cryptography in the past we need to

535
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,580
keep in mind crypto agility and that we

536
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,039
need to find ways to hybrid cryptography

537
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,320
and use several algorithms at once not

538
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,140
just one one or two algorithms that

539
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,200
we're familiar today

540
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,780
and I have several resources here that

541
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,580
you can read after

542
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,340
um and I encourage you to read more

543
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,799
about this topic to be aware of that

544
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,400
it's a really cool topic and let me know

545
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,020
if you have any questions I'll wait for

546
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,260
you outside thank you so much
