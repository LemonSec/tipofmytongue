2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,440
thank you

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,559
[Music]

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,839
hello everyone

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,880
thank you very much for having me I'm so

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,160
excited for my first trip to Israel and

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,720
to see some of you in person for the

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,779
first time it's very very exciting

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,420
oh it's excited

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,760
it's early everybody's motivated so I do

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,740
have a question for you all who works

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,899
professionally in industrial cyber

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,820
security here raise your hand just for

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,460
my own reference just a couple okay for

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,840
the rest of you I hope you have your

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,420
beer and your snack welcome to class

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,640
for the next 50 minutes I am going to

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,980
tell you why what I do is important and

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,180
we're going to take a journey through

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,879
time together and we are going to talk

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,640
about the history and the current state

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,680
and the future of industrial cyber

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,660
security but first a lot of you don't

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,360
know me hi my name is Leslie it's very

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,980
nice to know you

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,319
and I work for a company called dragos

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,020
which specializes in industrial cyber

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,820
security specifically for critical

29
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,520
infrastructure so power water sewage

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,640
treatment Transportation

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,380
manufacturing oil and gas

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,420
and I've worked there for about five and

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,040
a half years before that I spent 10

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,380
years at Motorola also working on those

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,040
kinds of manufacturing radio over IP

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,200
non-standard systems so cyber security

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,119
for computers that don't look like the

38
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,460
computers a lot of us are used to prior

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,840
to that I was in the United States Air

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,400
Force so I've spent a long career

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,280
working on weird computers and and very

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,720
important computers that people don't

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,220
think about a lot

44
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,040
and outside of that I speak I blog I

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,920
annoy people on the internet and I teach

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,979
on this subject quite a bit

47
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,920
so why am I standing on this wonderful

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,740
stage in front of you today well

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,520
um

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,220
these systems industrial control systems

51
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,920
do a lot of very important things for

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,420
our society

53
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,100
and a lot of them we don't think about a

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,280
lot now most of us are from countries in

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,318
the world where our infrastructure is

56
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,300
fairly stable

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,900
so when I talk about outages and those

58
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,400
systems not working what do you normally

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,080
think about you think about like the

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,640
power going out because we're used to

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,400
that when I talk about utility failing

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,220
most of you your first thought is

63
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,959
I know what a power outage looks like

64
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,239
that's something that happens that I can

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,640
relate to so when we talk about cyber

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,260
attacks against critical infrastructure

67
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,300
you're probably thinking attacks on the

68
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,239
power grid a lot of people do that but

69
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,700
we're surrounded by industrial Control

70
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,220
Systems they do very very important

71
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,260
things for our society

72
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,120
they do things like make sure that our

73
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,099
sewage goes the right direction leaves

74
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,739
their homes which is very very important

75
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,620
they make sure that our Logistics are

76
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,840
just-in-time Logistics get the things we

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,060
buy and eat to where they're supposed to

78
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,819
go our trains run even the building

79
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,440
Automation in this building is

80
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
controlled by bacnet industrial Control

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,739
Systems things like the lighting and the

82
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,379
heating and cooling and all the things

83
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,700
that are making this conference run

84
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,060
today run on those types of systems

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,400
so what I want to get across to you I

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,519
have 45 minutes here to get across to

87
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,819
how these systems work how they fail the

88
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,560
history of how they got to where they're

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,340
at

90
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,800
and what that means for the future so

91
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,420
where we are today in terms of how

92
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,920
they're being attacked and what I think

93
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,620
is going to happen in the future

94
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,459
do you want me to switch

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,099
okay

96
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,000
all right I like this microphone too

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,459
this is a very nice microphone as well

98
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,060
perfect okay so we're in class now

99
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,879
all right so first of all industrial

100
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,799
Control Systems I am going to be talking

101
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,780
about processes

102
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,060
before we can have this conversation

103
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,720
about industrial Control Systems we need

104
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,599
to understand that they all come down to

105
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,879
holistic processes

106
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,920
a process what is that it's something

107
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,379
physical happening in the real world so

108
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,780
something getting made something getting

109
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,478
packaged something moving physically

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,459
kinetically happening in the real world

111
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,019
so it could be anything from the lights

112
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,080
going on to the toilet flushing to a

113
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,360
train going down the track

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,580
we are not talking about these systems

115
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,400
in a vacuum of cyber security they don't

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,880
just exist as computers they are part of

117
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,560
this holistic thing that we need to have

118
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,840
happen or bad stuff will occur there are

119
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,400
consequences

120
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,680
if you get nothing else out of my

121
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
keynote today the two words that you

122
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,280
need to come away with go have your beer

123
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
after this that's fine

124
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,380
processes and consequences if you want

125
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,000
to help this space

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
those are the two most critical things

127
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,900
you have to think about and understand

128
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,020
and constantly be aware of it has so

129
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,639
little to do with an individual computer

130
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,199
processes have to be controlled by

131
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,240
something now an industrial process

132
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,460
could be controlled by a human being who

133
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,979
could control every Machine by hand and

134
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,020
make sure that everything happens that's

135
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,020
supposed to along the way say boxing up

136
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,720
a can of food you know they can they can

137
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,580
you can can your own food if you've

138
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,380
never done that yes you can can your own

139
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,360
food and you can put a label on it and

140
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,860
you can put it in the box and you have

141
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,780
done a process there something has been

142
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,820
created and there was no automation

143
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,380
involved at all

144
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,479
but something has to control that

145
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,220
process right whether it's a machine or

146
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,560
a human or whatever

147
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,440
industrial Control Systems provide some

148
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,900
level of automation to this process

149
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,759
that's happening so instead of a human

150
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,199
being standing there and sticking the

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,880
label on each can and then putting it

152
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
you know in the Box to be sent out and

153
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
mailing it there's there's some kind of

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
machine that's doing some of this

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,900
to automate a process you have to have

156
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,120
something called control loops

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,940
each control Loop has three parts okay

158
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,620
this is important I know this is getting

159
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,840
a little techy but this is important to

160
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,580
understand to understand how bad people

161
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,340
break them okay so you have first of all

162
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,340
a sensor and your sensor is something

163
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,080
that detects the state of what's

164
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,120
happening in that process it could sense

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,940
temperature it could sense movement it

166
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,979
could sense pressure any any physical

167
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,539
step

168
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,720
and then you have an actuator that makes

169
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,419
the thing move or heat up or cool down

170
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,340
or increase pressure so something

171
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,979
physical is done with this actuator

172
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,539
but something has to make decisions

173
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,020
right so something has to control based

174
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,759
on what the sensor detects something has

175
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,319
to make decisions about what the

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,120
actuator does now let me give you a

177
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,400
really easy example of that I have been

178
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,259
to two Microsoft offices around here

179
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,759
recently and I think this is a pretty

180
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,199
common thing who has ever gone through

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,060
an automatic revolving door I always

182
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,160
check to make sure I'm not the only okay

183
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,620
I'm not the only one for anybody who's

184
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,539
watching online a few people did raise

185
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,860
their hand that they have been through

186
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,660
an automatic revolving door

187
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,580
so this is a really simple control Loop

188
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,800
right so there is a sensor it detects if

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,479
you walk into the door

190
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,340
and then there's an actuator the door

191
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,259
starts to turn the motor turns on the

192
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,000
door but there's also a controller there

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,800
you have to Roller make some decisions

194
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,840
right so it decides hey is there

195
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,699
somebody in the door

196
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,340
if so if a sensor says there's somebody

197
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,900
in the door then start turning the door

198
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,699
but it makes some other decisions right

199
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,440
because we've all had a door go wrong

200
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,060
right we've all gotten hit by one of

201
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,099
those doors or it stopped in her face

202
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,960
it's got another sensor it's got a

203
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,580
sensor on the actuator actually that

204
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,099
says is there something obstructing the

205
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,560
door and if so stop turning so you don't

206
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,940
hurt them

207
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,979
sometimes those don't work completely

208
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,780
accurately but there's there's a whole

209
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,340
control cycle that's all being

210
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,020
controlled by this controller that makes

211
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,880
decisions about what this door is going

212
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,699
to do based on the input it's getting so

213
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,620
really simple process control Loop but

214
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,539
this gives you an idea of how this works

215
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,580
because this helps us understand how

216
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,000
every process Loop in the world can fail

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,060
now a revolving door failing not a huge

218
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,979
deal actually when I use this example a

219
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,539
lot and I'd say I was researching it I

220
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,160
found out there actually are a lot of

221
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,139
injuries from those doors every year but

222
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,379
thankfully no fatalities usually um but

223
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,879
anyway what can go wrong with our door

224
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,280
well the same four things that can go

225
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,800
wrong with every other control Loop the

226
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,259
first one is it fails to start the

227
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,419
actuary the actuator fails to start when

228
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,620
it's supposed to

229
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,120
so when you get into the door it just

230
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,339
doesn't start turning okay I mean not a

231
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,140
big deal just kind of annoying

232
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,200
it fails to stop when it's supposed to

233
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,940
so you get in the door and you get hit

234
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,380
in the in the back of the head with the

235
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,540
door because it doesn't stop in time

236
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,920
or more severely it starts too early or

237
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,540
too late so you get in the door and

238
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,220
there's a delay and maybe you run into

239
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,560
the door kind of annoying too maybe you

240
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,300
get bonked by something

241
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,100
or it goes on for the wrong period of

242
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,620
time so it maybe it keeps running for

243
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,360
five minutes after somebody gets out of

244
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,320
the door

245
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,220
in a door not a big deal in a metal

246
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,220
Factory a big deal when the metal

247
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,459
doesn't stop pouring on time or it

248
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:15,899
doesn't start and they have to go check

249
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,000
it out or it pours the wrong amount of

250
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,940
molten metal same with trains fairly

251
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,220
severe if they don't stop or start on

252
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,839
time or the door on the train doesn't

253
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,660
close when it's supposed to so these

254
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,700
same failure states can happen to any

255
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,160
process and this is the root whether

256
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,620
nefarious or just accidental or a

257
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,360
maintenance problem of everything that

258
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,220
can go wrong with these processes we're

259
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,440
talking about

260
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,440
why is this important well um there's

261
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,420
lots of things that fail in industrial

262
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,580
processes that aren't cyber attacks so

263
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,899
we know very much how bad it can be when

264
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,360
there are failures in an industrial

265
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,980
process any of those four types of

266
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,300
failures

267
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,060
in 1984 one of the worst industrial

268
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,339
disasters in history happened it was

269
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,680
that the Bhopal India plant of Union

270
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,240
Carbide

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,000
and over a half a million people were

272
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,240
exposed to toxic chemicals and thousands

273
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,380
died

274
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,779
there was a multitude of failures of

275
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,700
Safety Systems and controls and human

276
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,500
failures that occurred for this to

277
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,360
happen and

278
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,640
don't go Google this don't look at

279
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,440
images of this it's just a horrific

280
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
disaster but we have to remember that

281
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,700
this is the type of consequence that we

282
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,560
are talking about when we're talking

283
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,959
about industrial control system failures

284
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,720
this isn't Social Security numbers or

285
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,940
credit card numbers or medical data

286
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,680
being stolen that's all bad

287
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,640
that's terrible but this is thousands of

288
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,160
people dead because a physical process

289
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,160
was impacted and and there were dire

290
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,620
consequences

291
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,000
um

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
so this is what we're trying to prevent

293
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,200
no big deal right this is the type of

294
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,459
thing that we're trying to prevent as

295
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,019
we're working in securing these these

296
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,660
industrial processes

297
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,420
we rely on Industrial control systems

298
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,399
for everything in our society I've

299
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,140
talked about they're just surrounding us

300
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,240
all the time and unless they fail we

301
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
usually don't notice them we don't

302
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,720
notice that they exist because we are so

303
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,240
used to them working reliably in most of

304
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,420
the places we've grown up and we live

305
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,079
um

306
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,019
and we've also become very reliant on

307
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,360
these digitized and automated Control

308
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,940
Systems they are a part of our

309
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,399
large-scale Urban Development and our

310
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,019
industrialization and our mass

311
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,760
production and just-in-time Logistics

312
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,700
today again very severe conference

313
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,560
consequences if they don't work right

314
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,180
but we are very used to them working

315
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,640
right again most of us there are places

316
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,839
in the world where that's not true

317
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,140
certainly but the problem is for us we

318
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,940
don't think about a lot of the ways that

319
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,680
these can fail and that's a big problem

320
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,120
because I guarantee the bad guys are

321
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,640
let's start with how did we get into

322
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,200
this mess that's usually what I get

323
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,820
asked the most so I want I want to start

324
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,899
there

325
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,399
first of all because we're talking about

326
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,600
traveling through time at this

327
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,220
conference which is kind of fun but

328
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,980
second of all because to understand the

329
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,140
problem and fix the problem you have to

330
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,540
understand how we got here and why

331
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,180
things are the way that they are

332
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,740
so first of all industrial Control

333
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,720
Systems have existed for a very long

334
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,720
time they aren't just computers like I

335
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,519
said there's something that makes a

336
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,160
process work in an automated way so that

337
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,500
could be mechanical it could be analog

338
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,800
Electronics or digital computers

339
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,079
the earliest industrial control system

340
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,640
there's there's endless debate about

341
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,380
this in the world about what the first

342
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,540
one was and I'm not gonna that's like a

343
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,700
political religious argument but

344
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,040
think about this the there was a water

345
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,339
clock made in Egypt that required just

346
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,320
mechanical operation to entirely

347
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,480
mechanically controlled around

348
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,220
um

349
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,540
270 BC so so even before A.D you know

350
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,279
that there's been industrial Control

351
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,700
Systems arguably for thousands of years

352
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,260
if we want to talk about more

353
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,660
sophisticated industrial processes the

354
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,420
first furnace thermostat was made to be

355
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,700
used in industrial applications by

356
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,959
drebel in 1620 so here we are in the

357
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,620
1600s using primitive furnace controls

358
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,500
to again automate part of making things

359
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,660
so that a human being doesn't have to

360
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,240
figure out what's going on

361
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
in the early 20th century in the late

362
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,519
19th century there was a focus on

363
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,000
Maritime and timekeeping and trains in

364
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
the early industrial control systems and

365
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,380
again most of these were mechanical they

366
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,480
were Mechanical Devices this is the

367
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,399
industrial area the Industrial

368
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,320
Revolution and the industrial boom when

369
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,579
we first started thinking about mass

370
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,440
production so people wanted to do things

371
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,959
more quickly and efficiently

372
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,660
so first of all we saw these mechanical

373
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,760
industrial Control Systems used to say

374
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,100
do things like keep time in a very very

375
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,860
regulated way or do things like control

376
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,320
early transportation that was more

377
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,120
mechanical and automated like trains

378
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,820
into the 20th century when we started

379
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,760
seeing more electricity across the board

380
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,700
we start seeing the use of analog

381
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,639
industrial control devices so that had a

382
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,980
lot to do with the development of mass

383
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,200
production manufacturing things like the

384
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,740
automotive industry and also Aviation we

385
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,600
suddenly needed to have these much more

386
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,360
accurate specific wide-scale industrial

387
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,820
control devices that also had something

388
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,920
to do with urbanization as more and more

389
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,720
people moved to cities there are bigger

390
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
populations to support with

391
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,480
infrastructure

392
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,519
so we start seeing this migration it's

393
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
not complete there's still mechanical

394
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
control devices out there but some

395
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,420
migration to electronic control devices

396
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,220
and here we're talking about primitive

397
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,380
Electronics but not electronic devices

398
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,699
nonetheless

399
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,680
so simple circuits to make those

400
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,560
decisions instead of gears and weights

401
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,959
again still control loops still

402
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,060
something making decisions but something

403
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,979
making decisions with a circuit now

404
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,660
in the mid 20th century we started

405
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,880
seeing computers appear computers can do

406
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,920
more stuff right you can program them in

407
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,959
a much more sophisticated way than these

408
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,899
Analog Devices or mechanical devices

409
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,000
the first time we saw an industrial

410
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,740
computer used for industrial

411
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,199
applications was Louisiana Power and

412
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,860
Light in 1958 but the first use of a

413
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,620
specific industrial control system made

414
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,220
to run a process was in 1959 at Texaco

415
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,199
I've actually got a manual for the

416
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,880
computer they used the room size

417
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,100
computer that they used at Texaco in

418
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,639
1959 to run their Industrial Systems but

419
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,519
this just kicked off a surge of using

420
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,199
computers to run industrial stuff

421
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,120
because it was proven very very fast

422
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
that a computer could make great

423
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,839
decisions you could program it to make

424
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,760
these simple logic decisions in these

425
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,699
control loops and take away not the

426
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,160
necessity for having human operators or

427
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,720
less sophisticated electronic or

428
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,500
mechanical systems so by 1971 there were

429
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,660
41 manufacturers of industrial control

430
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,940
system computers digital computers

431
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,220
making these decisions in these control

432
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,199
loops instead of

433
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,899
the previous electronic circuits and

434
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,820
human operators and mechanical devices

435
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,920
that used to run those processes and

436
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,800
that let people scale up a lot all of a

437
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,180
sudden you're able to run things on a

438
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,800
much grander scale because the computer

439
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,480
is making some of the decisions about

440
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,699
what happens in the process you program

441
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,300
them and they follow a tree of decisions

442
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,160
most industrial control systems that are

443
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,019
digital run on something called ladder

444
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,720
logic which is basically like a circuit

445
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,959
flow it's very simple programming based

446
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,720
on the state we talked about sensors

447
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,339
you know the controller is getting

448
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,899
feedback from the actuator and the

449
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,699
sensors and it's making decisions

450
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,620
so ladder logic is just a simple

451
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,959
decision tree that tells the device if I

452
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,599
get these inputs this is the output I do

453
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,059
so pretty simple programming but it much

454
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,679
more efficient and again you can do

455
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,859
things at a much much grander scale

456
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,339
so that said let's understand why we had

457
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,400
to get even fancier yeah that's great

458
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,439
the room size computer that can make

459
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,660
some decisions for you is great but

460
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,299
there's much more complexity to most

461
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,460
industrial processes than your door your

462
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,840
evolving door

463
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,700
most of them involve a lot of control

464
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,780
loops

465
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,539
my favorite example I don't know why is

466
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,039
canning tuna

467
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,780
I just think that's a really interesting

468
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,340
process maybe I'm just hungry all the

469
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,600
time but

470
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,200
um

471
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,260
think about canning food yes you can do

472
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,580
it yourself again I said that earlier

473
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,440
you can can your own food but if you

474
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,780
have a process that produces cans of

475
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,880
food well first of all you have to make

476
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,740
you have to put the food in the can and

477
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,419
seal it and can it

478
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,400
and then you have to put it down a

479
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,440
conveyor belt right and then you have to

480
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,580
put a label on it and then you have to

481
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,919
put it in a box and if you're having all

482
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,380
that done automatically that's a lot of

483
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,539
different individual control loops that

484
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,299
have to happen in the right sequence at

485
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,240
the same appropriate timeline because

486
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,640
you don't want like the tuna dumping not

487
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,500
into a can on your conveyor belt that'd

488
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,539
be disgusting and you don't want like to

489
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,400
have the label stuck to the conveyor

490
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,980
belt and three labels on one can and

491
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,900
things so you could have a bunch of

492
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,280
control loops here that are each

493
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,679
functioning by itself but if they don't

494
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,820
fit together in a larger process at the

495
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,559
right time you get some really weird

496
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,539
results right so you have to have a big

497
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,520
computer that controls all the little

498
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,620
computers you have to have something

499
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,020
that's making the decision about how all

500
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,059
those individual process Loops fit

501
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,860
together in synchronization

502
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,900
so really what you end up with is what I

503
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,400
have on the screen here is a bunch of

504
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,799
control loops that have to have a big

505
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,000
computer

506
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,799
making decisions about how they fit

507
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,200
together so first of first of all we had

508
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,059
distributed Control Systems which are

509
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,700
just a computer that kind of like in a

510
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,440
factory situation put all the control

511
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,299
loops together and make decisions to

512
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,160
keep them all synchronized

513
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,200
but then later on as computers got more

514
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,900
sophisticated we developed scada so ICS

515
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,640
and skater are not interchangeable terms

516
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,340
scada we're referring to widespread

517
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,520
geographically control of a multitude of

518
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,740
industrial control systems and getting

519
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,440
good Telemetry from them and doing like

520
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,500
large Geographic areas of control

521
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,660
so now we've brought in a lot of

522
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,640
computers and a lot less people and now

523
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,380
the computers are doing a lot of stuff

524
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,240
for us right but that's good because we

525
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,580
can do things on a much grander scale in

526
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,080
terms of manufacturing and

527
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,880
transportation building automation

528
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,679
because you don't have a you have to

529
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,000
have a human being standing there

530
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,220
looking at each thing the computers are

531
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,200
making decisions about all this really

532
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
really important stuff and most of the

533
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,760
time as we know things work very very

534
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,780
well until they don't

535
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,559
so the next concept you have to

536
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,559
understand is where these computers have

537
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,500
gone okay so at first in the early

538
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,360
digital systems that were controlling

539
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,760
Industrial Systems

540
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,640
they ran their own software their own

541
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,980
operating systems it was all custom they

542
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,960
were very Purpose Driven and they were

543
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,940
vendor specific

544
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,820
but as one does the people who build

545
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,039
those systems are also operating with

546
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,179
margins

547
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,860
and somewhere along the line they

548
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,539
realized that it's a lot cheaper to

549
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,299
write software and like Windows embedded

550
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,880
and you know it's a lot cheaper to not

551
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,559
write your own protocol stack for

552
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,840
networks it's really cheap to like send

553
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,480
things over ethernet tcpip

554
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,980
saves a lot of money you can do a lot

555
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,240
more stuff again we're trying to do

556
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,760
things at scale so over the last 20

557
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,500
years a lot of this industrial

558
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,660
technology not necessarily the lowest

559
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,640
level plcs that are the simple

560
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,679
ruggedized computers but the stack of

561
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,140
stuff as we talk about scada and these

562
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,120
distributed control systems and things

563
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,820
the networks which allow access to them

564
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,620
and connect them to one another

565
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,660
they've started to look a lot more like

566
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,120
our Enterprise networks yes there are

567
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,860
low-level devices that are still running

568
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,860
ladder logic but they have to report to

569
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,600
computers that show the status of the

570
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,880
system and that program them and those

571
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,520
are more and more

572
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,919
familiar I.T type operating systems so

573
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,919
things like embedded Windows XP or

574
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,659
Windows 2008 server Linux Etc and you're

575
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,460
seeing things run over Cisco networking

576
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,620
gear things like that because it's

577
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,900
efficient and you can do more at lower

578
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,179
prices and there's competition in the

579
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,980
vendor space

580
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,620
so we call this itot operational

581
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,799
technology convergence these technology

582
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,720
spaces are starting to converge they

583
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,059
have been for quite a long time

584
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,240
the problem is as you bring in Windows

585
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,159
and you bring in Cisco and all these

586
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
typical computer vendors and software

587
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,559
and protocol Stacks you bring in all the

588
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,240
attack space as well

589
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,280
so you've now introduced a bunch of

590
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,320
vulnerability space and potential

591
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,780
exploit space Etc to your industrial

592
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,120
environment of course before they were

593
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,260
just relying on a security through

594
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,179
obscurity but that really is kind of a

595
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,380
thing when you have to bring in an

596
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,419
expert on the niche system to do

597
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,340
something to it

598
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,080
um yeah I know I know everybody's like

599
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,760
cringing like security through obscurity

600
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,159
it is hard to do something to a process

601
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,659
again doing something to one device

602
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,700
isn't necessarily the most impactful

603
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,559
thing in the world impacting the process

604
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,539
that requires you know something about

605
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,940
the process how is electricity made how

606
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,280
does sewage get get moved out of a house

607
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,900
Etc so

608
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,299
yeah that was something they could kind

609
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,919
of rely on for a long time but now

610
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,720
you've got all these window systems in

611
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,720
there all these Linux systems and people

612
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,740
know how to attack those

613
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,840
so

614
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,280
so people started thinking about hey

615
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,840
what bad things can we do to these

616
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,880
systems you guys are also nevarious like

617
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,679
everybody's like hey how can we break

618
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,860
this thing that runs Society thanks

619
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,780
let's talk about some of the early cyber

620
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,820
attacks against Industrial Systems so

621
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,840
the first one I want to tell you about

622
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,340
is one that we never talk about which is

623
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,080
an attack against a sewage treatment

624
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,080
plant in Australia this happened in 2000

625
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,700
and we hardly ever talk about this one

626
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,500
but this is arguably again everybody

627
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,559
disagrees arguably maybe the first Cyber

628
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,940
attack that actually had a physical

629
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,700
impact against an industrial system it

630
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,460
was an Insider this guy he was a

631
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,260
contractor for the for the facility and

632
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,940
he didn't get hired for the job he

633
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,120
wanted and he knew a lot about that

634
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,980
industrial process and he knew it was

635
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,320
radio controlled by a computer

636
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,600
and he was like I have this stuff and

637
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,340
I'm pretty mad at them right now so we

638
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,700
went outside with his computer and he

639
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,000
dumped a whole bunch of raw sewage into

640
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,700
a water reservoir and it took them a

641
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,320
while to do forensics because nobody had

642
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,059
ever done anything like that before to

643
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,860
figure out what the heck happened

644
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,620
because he did it over radio

645
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,620
um after he had uh left the organization

646
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,900
but he had enough system knowledge that

647
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,460
he could do a really bad thing he

648
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,980
understood the process and he understood

649
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,799
the converged Ito Tech OT technology

650
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,840
enough to do something incredibly

651
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,179
malicious

652
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,059
seven years later we see research being

653
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,740
done around these types of attacks so

654
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,080
Idaho National Laboratories conducted an

655
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,140
attack saying hey what bad stuff can you

656
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,880
do just using a computer to an

657
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,159
industrial system we started thinking

658
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,600
about this this is probably going to be

659
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760
really bad let's go try it out so they

660
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,260
bought a generator

661
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,419
and not to get into the details of the

662
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,000
physics but what they said is just using

663
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,980
the industrial control system

664
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,380
let's see if we can blow up this

665
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,720
generator and so what they did

666
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,460
essentially was turn it on and off

667
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,620
really really fast and shake it to

668
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,720
pieces and if you go watch this video

669
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,700
which I'm not going to spend 15 minutes

670
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,960
letting you watch right now it's very

671
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,600
enjoyable to watch pull it up later

672
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,880
um it starts smoking and then it it just

673
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,620
stops working and there's a big Billow

674
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,659
of smoke they had a lot of fun with that

675
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,120
but the implications of it are much less

676
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,340
fun because that's when people really

677
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,220
that made CNN that made BBC that that

678
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,460
was a an actual story that made Global

679
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,039
News and people really started thinking

680
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,200
then about hey they just use a computer

681
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,039
to you know kill a very large generator

682
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,900
industrial generator

683
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,799
um just using commands from a computer

684
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,600
I don't need to spend a bunch of time

685
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,159
telling you all about stuxnet everybody

686
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,419
has been stuck snutted to death um

687
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:41,580
but it would be remiss of me not to not

688
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,740
mention it of course since it was such a

689
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,240
pivotal attack in industrial control

690
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,980
history

691
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,600
um of course it was discovered in 2010

692
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,659
really big deal really big news uh it

693
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,360
was specifically designed with a lot of

694
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,400
Technical and process knowledge again

695
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,179
processes process consequence knowledge

696
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:02,220
to disrupt operations and physically

697
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,520
damage nuclear centrifuges in Iran it

698
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,860
did that effectively it was incredibly

699
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,140
specialized there was obviously a ton of

700
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,940
work and effort and subject matter

701
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,740
knowledge process knowledge that went

702
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,960
into creating it and it stunned the

703
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,419
world it really changed everything in

704
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:19,919
this landscape of industrial cyber

705
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,659
security because it was like

706
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:22,980
I mean

707
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,840
states have already always done

708
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,299
Espionage sabotage criminals have always

709
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,100
done criminal things that doesn't change

710
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,799
but this was like a whole new landscape

711
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,020
for doing that and it was something that

712
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,179
could be done remotely instead of having

713
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,520
an agent physically necessarily on site

714
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,179
like big change big change of thinking

715
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,640
for both Defenders and for people

716
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,679
conducting attacks hey this is possible

717
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,080
it was very effective and it was done in

718
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,059
an entirely new way

719
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,960
so after that we see things spin up

720
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,960
quite drastically in 2014 another case

721
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,940
that people don't talk about a lot

722
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,700
the German government releases a annual

723
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,220
report on reported cyber attacks and in

724
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,679
2014 there was a footnote basically in

725
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,620
the report that said major catastrophic

726
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,260
damage to a steel mill in Germany via a

727
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,760
Cyber attack

728
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,039
a lot of details of this are shrouded in

729
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,380
mystery and back Channel but essentially

730
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,419
steel mills are a very dangerous

731
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,640
industrial process they're one of the

732
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,380
most potentially dangerous to the people

733
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,900
who work in the facility you're working

734
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,299
with molten metal I mean it's just like

735
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,460
there's heavy stuff there's hot stuff

736
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,679
it's just incredibly incredibly a

737
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,260
dangerous process to work around and in

738
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,000
this case there was a Cyber attack

739
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,980
against this German steel mill we don't

740
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,159
know specifically who did it but they

741
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,220
could they resulted in massive damage to

742
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,200
this facility which is very very scary

743
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,940
given this process and the implications

744
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,520
to The Operators

745
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,380
then of course we have the attacks the

746
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,600
two major attacks against the Ukrainian

747
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,700
power grid Ukraine has of course always

748
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,799
been a test bed for cyber attacks for

749
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:05,520
geopolitical reasons and um in December

750
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,940
of 2015 there was a traditional I.T

751
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,100
style intrusion using black energy

752
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,100
malware to get into their I.T Network

753
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,600
and then

754
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,700
what is apparent that happened is a

755
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,440
specialist in their industrial Control

756
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,080
Systems from the adversary manually

757
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
essentially manually made changes to the

758
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,919
system to bring down power for several

759
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,100
hours

760
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,440
scary stuff they restored power pretty

761
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,000
fast

762
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,840
um

763
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,520
but that was because they had incredibly

764
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,500
good recovery processes and very skilled

765
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,539
operators we don't want to downplay how

766
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,400
good the ukrainians were

767
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,320
a year later

768
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,419
the adversary came back and they

769
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,919
conducted a more technically

770
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,080
sophisticated attack now they had

771
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,880
malware developed to do the attacking

772
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,100
for them in the industrial system

773
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,380
so now we've moved from a human person

774
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,080
having to conduct the attack to a piece

775
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,880
of malware that can conduct pieces of

776
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,980
the attack for them and make things much

777
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,360
more efficient and that happened over

778
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,980
the course of a year

779
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,279
and it wasn't just that they also did

780
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,039
like anti-forensics anti-restoration

781
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,260
things as well so for instance they

782
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,900
destroyed the cereal the ethernet

783
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,340
converters that would have allowed

784
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,679
somebody to do restoration remotely so

785
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,179
it's the dead of winter in Ukraine and

786
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,100
now you have to send human beings out to

787
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,779
the facilities to restore the computer

788
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,179
systems to get them up and running in an

789
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,159
automated way and until that was done

790
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,899
everything had to be run manually

791
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,539
thankfully Ukraine had the ability to

792
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,880
run things manually still that isn't

793
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,500
true everywhere in the world anymore

794
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,840
these these systems have grown much

795
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
bigger than human staffs in a lot of

796
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,720
cases

797
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,080
so scary stuff and major kudos to the

798
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,120
Ukraine utility operators who restored

799
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,399
very quickly from both of these rather

800
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,139
stunning alarming attacks

801
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,919
so things get a little scarier I mean

802
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,600
again there are some nefarious people

803
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,340
out there in the world who are just I

804
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,620
mean ethically

805
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,899
you can debate like who you could steal

806
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:05,700
money from you know like there's debates

807
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,380
about who it's ethical to steal money

808
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,940
from if they're bad people stuff like

809
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,320
that out there in the hacker Community

810
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,140
but

811
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,399
potentially killing somebody is always

812
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,500
potentially killing somebody

813
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,960
um trisis was an attack against an

814
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,840
industrial safety system

815
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,460
um

816
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,799
these systems these processes these

817
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,080
overall processes

818
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,640
have a lot of safety controls in them

819
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,440
right so there's physical safety

820
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,480
controls mechanical safety controls on

821
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,580
most industrial processes that keep bad

822
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,080
things from happening not necessarily

823
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,179
Cyber attack things but maintenance

824
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,760
problems human error there's things like

825
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,159
pressure Valves and release Valves and

826
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,559
there's there's physical parts of the

827
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,539
process that try to stop bad things from

828
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,760
happening catastrophically there's also

829
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,559
electronic systems that do that and

830
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,840
human systems so there's human checkso

831
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,580
systems as well to make sure they run

832
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,679
safely even if there's a problem

833
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,200
but now there's also computer Safety

834
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,020
Systems as well they're very common they

835
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,659
usually run on it we hope we hope on a

836
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,100
separate Network than the industrial

837
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,860
control systems and they make decisions

838
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,919
on whether to shut down the process so

839
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,020
if these computer systems these safety

840
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,880
instrumentation systems see a bad

841
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,940
condition they go and they shut down the

842
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,960
process

843
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,360
so that's great right except when

844
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,039
somebody learns how to hack those safety

845
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,659
systems and make them do the wrong thing

846
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:31,559
so in 2017 crisis or Triton depending on

847
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,659
who you talk to was discovered and it

848
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,260
was used to try to tamper with a safety

849
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,600
instrumentation computer system

850
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,779
and it was the implications of this it

851
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,179
wasn't incredibly successful for a

852
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,820
multitude of reasons but

853
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,679
this is somebody thinking about what if

854
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,779
we make the safety system not work

855
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,880
the result of that there's two potential

856
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,039
outcomes of that first of all the safety

857
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,600
system doesn't go off when there's a

858
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,340
potentially deadly condition happening

859
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,539
in the facility

860
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,820
which is horrifying ethically for a lot

861
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,020
of reasons

862
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,760
but there's also the less severe

863
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,620
consequence of somebody knows how to hit

864
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,779
the big red button on the wall using the

865
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,240
computer and stop your process suddenly

866
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,940
which can have major implications for

867
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,500
your equipment that can be very damaging

868
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,799
to your process so very alarming to see

869
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,779
people poking around with safety systems

870
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,539
and for for a lot of reasons there's not

871
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,340
a lot of justification for trying to

872
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,480
kill people's operators

873
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,320
recently

874
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,899
um well we've seen a lot of potentially

875
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,240
alarming and evolving things happening

876
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,320
in this space

877
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:37,980
um

878
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,000
in 2021 we saw a intrusion into a water

879
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,919
facility in Florida in the United States

880
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,159
where somebody utilized a very insecure

881
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,080
Municipal Water System remote access

882
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,200
tool to gain access to the water system

883
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,059
control and start tampering with the

884
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,100
chemical levels in it fortunately that

885
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,380
was caught again human safety controls

886
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,899
but it very easily couldn't have could

887
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,640
have not been

888
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,799
we've also seen a lot of use of

889
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,600
ransomware

890
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,340
adversaries are getting smarter about

891
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,320
launching their criminal commodity

892
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,360
attacks they are choosing their targets

893
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,100
more sensibly by who will potentially

894
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,140
pay who will have to pay a ransom

895
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,179
they're making smarter decisions about

896
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:19,440
that instead of just attacking

897
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,399
everywhere so my speculation given a

898
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,899
limited data set is that there are

899
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,279
probably continuing to be less

900
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,559
ransomware attacks but there are more

901
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,659
effective ransomware attacks by smarter

902
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,220
adversaries because their margins are

903
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,380
decreasing too

904
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,360
so we've seen a lot more ransomware

905
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,159
attacks against industrial environments

906
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,980
because they do critical things and if

907
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,380
they're brought to a halt by say their

908
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,659
operator workstations no longer showing

909
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,760
the state of the system

910
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,279
the low-level computers like the plcs

911
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,840
will probably not get Ransom they'll

912
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,100
probably keep working but if the

913
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,620
operators cannot see what's happening to

914
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,419
their system because their Windows XP

915
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:00,360
monitoring workstation just got ransomed

916
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,980
that's a big problem that means they

917
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,720
have to shut the whole facility down and

918
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,220
it's very likely that they're going to

919
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,480
pay the ransom if they don't have

920
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,359
another alternative so ransomware is

921
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,619
very effective against industrial

922
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,540
facilities we've seen it again and again

923
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,800
and again

924
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,099
in 2022 my company dragos discovered and

925
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,379
analyzed a piece of mower called pipe

926
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,599
dream where we saw a toolkit being

927
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,480
developed to attack a specific subset of

928
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,219
Industrial Systems

929
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,800
why is that meaningful because it is

930
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,020
another Pandora's Box

931
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,659
think about from an I.T perspective what

932
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,540
Metasploit or Cobalt strike did to the

933
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,359
attack landscape when you lower the bar

934
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,239
to entry in any type of intrusion in any

935
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,960
space people do take note and it makes

936
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,940
attacks more efficient again adversaries

937
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,580
are trying to make money the cheapest

938
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,199
way possible the most efficient way

939
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,699
possible they are a business as well

940
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,280
they're a billion dollar industry

941
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,260
as we start seeing more and more people

942
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,580
gain enough knowledge to create

943
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,920
commercial tool kits to to attack

944
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,080
Industrial Systems that can be utilized

945
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,260
in criminal attacks that means there's

946
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,599
going to be more of those used it's just

947
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,220
an efficient way to attack people and

948
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,619
that's going to be a big problem so it's

949
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,359
not specifically that toolkit being

950
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,220
alarming but the fact that now people

951
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,380
know that that kind of toolkit can exist

952
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,640
and there's a market for it

953
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,420
I don't want to sound Doom and Gloom I

954
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,640
mean a lot of these things aren't new I

955
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,619
said that before but states have always

956
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,300
done sabotage they've always done

957
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,119
Espionage criminals have always tried to

958
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,280
steal things the fastest most efficient

959
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,200
most reliable way possible they're

960
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,180
trying to make money as quickly and

961
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,460
efficiently as possible that has not

962
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,740
changed it will never change nothing we

963
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,420
do in the cyber security space will

964
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,300
change the wants of states or the wants

965
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,160
of criminals

966
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,099
however computers make these things more

967
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,079
attainable more accessible to

968
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,720
adversaries especially remotely from

969
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,060
across the world so it's something we

970
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,859
deeply have to think about in terms of

971
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,980
geopolitics and in terms of how we mount

972
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,859
a defense and there are a lot of

973
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:13,200
problems in industrial control systems

974
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,220
to be solved in terms of cyber security

975
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,400
now I said I do I do work for a company

976
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
that specializes in industrial cyber

977
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,480
security called dragos and what I do

978
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,180
there is I do incident response

979
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,680
um specifically digital forensics and

980
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,000
incident response on these industrial

981
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,140
Networks

982
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,119
so to tell you a little bit about the

983
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,099
casework that I've been seeing recently

984
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,140
I can kind of divide it into three

985
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,000
categories so the first one is those

986
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,579
commodity attacks so things like the

987
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,079
ransomwares

988
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,200
the extortion etc those types of

989
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,060
criminal attacks that are mostly out

990
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,220
there to make money

991
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,740
there are also Insider threats that is

992
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,359
Perpetual again that's a thing that will

993
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,640
never go away but in terms of insiders

994
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,440
there's both the intentional insiders

995
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,300
who are trying to do something bad and

996
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,040
malicious and there are the

997
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,800
unintentional insiders the unintentional

998
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,420
insiders are the people who just want to

999
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,800
watch a movie they want to watch Netflix

1000
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,140
on their computer at the at the at the

1001
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,020
plant or the uh manufacturing place or

1002
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,579
the train or whatever

1003
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,380
and they do something to the computer

1004
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,119
they're not supposed to

1005
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,859
um that's equally effective for the

1006
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,000
adversaries

1007
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,920
and finally there are State adversary

1008
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,839
groups and they are out there believe me

1009
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,420
they aren't doing a lot of things that

1010
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,920
are visible because there is no

1011
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,500
geopolitical reason for them to do it

1012
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,839
but again these industrial networks have

1013
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,119
relied on security through obscurity for

1014
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,339
a very very long time

1015
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,160
so the adversaries have known that to do

1016
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,839
bad things to a process to cause

1017
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,480
consequences of concern in a process I'm

1018
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,339
back to those two words again

1019
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:49,320
they have to know about the process they

1020
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,640
have to understand what consequences

1021
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,619
would we be at and how it's caused in

1022
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,839
that industrial control environment so

1023
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,540
not just infecting a single computer but

1024
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,220
doing something that causes a

1025
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,680
consequence that really matters that

1026
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,720
takes knowledge of the process and of

1027
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,420
the Industrial Systems the vendor how

1028
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,800
it's engineered the safety device

1029
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
devices and human controls in place and

1030
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,540
that takes time to learn so there's a

1031
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,000
lot of reconnaissance happening that's

1032
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,560
what most states that are involved in

1033
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,119
this space are doing they are learning

1034
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,980
as much as they can about industrial

1035
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,320
environments and Technologies in places

1036
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,420
they might want to Target in the future

1037
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,460
they're also building footholds so

1038
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,440
they're they're staging pre-staging for

1039
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,000
future attacks

1040
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,980
very very important stuff to understand

1041
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,960
because that defeats that security

1042
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,640
through obscurity and especially with

1043
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,240
this itot convergence in Technologies

1044
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,940
barrier of Entry to launching meaningful

1045
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,579
attacks continues to lower every year it

1046
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,260
lowers and lowers and lowers to both

1047
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,300
States and to criminal groups

1048
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,859
so what what is the condition of these

1049
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,420
networks there's a lot of preconceptions

1050
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,339
and misconceptions about what's

1051
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:57,420
happening in these industrial

1052
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,339
environments first of all the first one

1053
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,540
I hear all the time is they don't care

1054
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,220
about cyber security

1055
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,720
well they do and don't they're very

1056
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,579
aware of cyber threats if you talk to

1057
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,859
your industrial peers operators and

1058
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,720
Engineers what they will care about is

1059
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,640
consequences if you want to have a

1060
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,680
conversation with them first of all

1061
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,440
bring them pastries or beer or something

1062
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,960
give a bribery will take you a long way

1063
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,540
but then talk about consequences talk

1064
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,339
about the consequences they're concerned

1065
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,320
about and think about how that

1066
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,760
potentially relates to cyber security

1067
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,980
you have to talk about the holistic

1068
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,619
process they are aware of malware they

1069
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,020
know about computers I I hate to shock

1070
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,720
you but some they have seen a computer

1071
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,880
um they are aware that there's hackers

1072
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,040
but if you tell them oh You're

1073
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,720
vulnerable to this vulnerability from

1074
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,160
last year that'll mean nothing to them

1075
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,599
you'll just sound like another auditor

1076
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,460
what you need to have a conversation

1077
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,540
about

1078
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,480
with their expertise as well is how does

1079
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,119
that fit into the process in terms of

1080
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:57,859
consequences in terms of risk

1081
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,119
a lot of these organizations that we're

1082
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,859
asking to do cyber security that do

1083
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,720
incredibly important things for a

1084
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,579
society like provide us clean drinking

1085
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,920
water in a lot of countries in a lot of

1086
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,079
cities are incredibly under-resourced

1087
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,420
there is great disparity in the

1088
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,980
verticals that have Industrial

1089
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,359
Technologies

1090
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,760
some like oil and gas have Oodles of

1091
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,400
money tons of money and they spend a lot

1092
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,140
of it on cyber security not necessarily

1093
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,880
always on the right things but they have

1094
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,140
a big budget

1095
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,660
others like municipalities sometimes

1096
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,640
they have one I.T person and we ask them

1097
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,140
to do all these cyber security things

1098
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,020
and they're like I'd love to that sounds

1099
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,180
really cool but I don't even have time

1100
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,940
to patch computers like are you going to

1101
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,339
send me some help and they just don't

1102
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,560
have the resources to do it

1103
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,780
regulation around the world really

1104
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,460
varies some verticals have some

1105
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,140
regulation usually like power because

1106
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,760
people think about that because they're

1107
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,099
used to power outages but it really

1108
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,560
varies by the city and the country and

1109
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,480
some industrial verticals are barely

1110
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,099
regulated at all in terms of cyber

1111
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,140
security

1112
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,240
and again there's a lot of

1113
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,460
miscommunication and faulty assumptions

1114
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,200
uh what are what are some of those

1115
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,300
faulty assumptions well like why is

1116
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,920
everything old in industrial

1117
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,500
environments well because again number

1118
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,900
one thing is the process working safely

1119
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,300
without consequences so very limited

1120
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,619
downtime

1121
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,380
very limited ability to modify systems

1122
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,420
because they work in a certain preset

1123
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,820
warrantied way from the vendor so you

1124
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,440
can't just take pieces out and swap them

1125
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,200
out as the security people as the I.T

1126
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,700
people you don't want to cause a worse

1127
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,260
consequence than the adversary that'd be

1128
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,220
terrible

1129
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,660
you don't want to be the one to bring

1130
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,220
down the process that's providing clean

1131
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,440
drinking water to people and upgrading

1132
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,300
an operating system or changing a

1133
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,099
protocol stack could easily do this

1134
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,920
these systems are reliable in a specific

1135
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,920
configuration so it's very hard and a

1136
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,260
time consuming process to change them to

1137
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,119
upgrade them it's not like working on

1138
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,099
your normal it systems even if they

1139
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,780
might look at them look like them in the

1140
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,820
higher levels

1141
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,480
in terms of tools oh my gosh

1142
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,700
there's there's next to nothing compared

1143
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,040
to the landscape I I see a cyber

1144
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,680
security is a huge space think about all

1145
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,180
the verticals I've talked about and then

1146
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,339
think about 40 Years of technology in

1147
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,079
those verticals

1148
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,740
that's a lot of computing devices from

1149
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,660
different vendors from different eras

1150
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,280
configured in different ways for

1151
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,839
different processes

1152
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:27,540
all of those need security research they

1153
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,700
all need security Technologies they all

1154
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,579
need forensics tools that's a huge

1155
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,320
landscape of work to be done in cyber

1156
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,359
security so a lot of the problems we

1157
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:38,940
face is just there hasn't been enough

1158
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,220
work in cyber security done in some of

1159
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,619
these spaces

1160
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:45,839
and we Face a lot of challenges in doing

1161
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,060
it first of all as I I will beat this to

1162
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,880
death processes and consequences all of

1163
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,859
our cyber security work all of our

1164
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:55,079
mitigations all of our tooling has to be

1165
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,940
done with process consequences in mind

1166
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,220
that means a ton of our work has to be

1167
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,319
passive we can't just get out there and

1168
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:02,880
vulnerability scan these environments

1169
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,339
they have incomplete protocol Stacks we

1170
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,440
could easily bring down devices by

1171
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,920
scanning them we can't install xdr EDR

1172
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,500
and I I get a lot of problems with that

1173
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,000
when I'm hiring people because I'm

1174
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,760
hiring forensics people to do forensics

1175
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,640
on computers that are like Windows NT

1176
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,200
how many of you learned how to do

1177
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,660
forensics in Windows NT and graduated

1178
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,500
from college since the year 2005.

1179
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,260
not a single soul raising their hand in

1180
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,240
the audience of cyber security Personnel

1181
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,980
there's probably 300 people out there oh

1182
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,980
there's one there's one okay

1183
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,640
two two okay two out of 350 people in

1184
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,920
this room right now yeah so I I

1185
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,440
interview people and when you go to a

1186
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,700
low-level sock job today

1187
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,960
um you usually spend a lot of time just

1188
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,819
working with EDR these days and that's

1189
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:56,339
not bad EDR and xdr incredible Next

1190
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,140
Generation firewalls they're amazing

1191
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,900
modern forensic agents amazing love them

1192
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,460
to death they're amazing for cyber

1193
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,339
security and they barely exist in ICS

1194
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:07,500
you've got to be able to do like old

1195
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,980
school partition recovery on Windows NT

1196
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,300
or you're not going to be able to do

1197
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,800
forensics for some of these Industrial

1198
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,720
Systems you've got to be able to build

1199
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,900
custom cables to connect to plcs who

1200
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,400
learned to do that in their cyber

1201
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,920
security program since 2005. a couple

1202
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,380
few maybe in the military yeah in the

1203
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,839
military we did that but

1204
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,420
um yeah I mean this is challenging stuff

1205
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,700
that people aren't taught anymore and we

1206
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,380
desperately need people who know how to

1207
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,640
do it so we're doing our best to

1208
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,740
pipeline people in but they have to

1209
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,900
learn the processes they have to learn

1210
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,119
about consequences consequence modeling

1211
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:44,400
risk and how to do all this Legacy Tech

1212
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,440
as well and they have to do that all

1213
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,119
with the constraints

1214
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,040
set in place to keep these processes

1215
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,319
running safely so maybe one maintenance

1216
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,900
window a year to bring things down

1217
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,359
very challenging it requires a lot of

1218
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,339
creativity a lot of adaptability it's

1219
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:02,280
fascinating it's really important I I

1220
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,980
can't say how much importance there is

1221
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,480
in doing this work it's incredibly

1222
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,700
valuable to society very meaningful

1223
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,640
there's no no ethical divide in in

1224
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,740
securing like Power Systems yeah they're

1225
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,579
critical for people being safe and alive

1226
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,800
um but yeah this is this is very

1227
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,119
challenging and there's some of these

1228
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,560
misconceptions

1229
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,240
there's a big focus in the research

1230
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,500
community on just finding

1231
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,660
vulnerabilities and bugs and exploits

1232
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,640
for the Industrial Systems instead of

1233
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,680
looking at the overall process

1234
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,300
yeah let me let me tell you a secret

1235
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,680
here I'm going to tell you a secret just

1236
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,260
for you you 350 of my closest friends

1237
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,579
here and everybody who's watching this

1238
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,800
recorded

1239
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,480
bugs and vulnerabilities and Industrial

1240
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,119
Systems are meaningful and important but

1241
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,520
every system and Industrial networks is

1242
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,260
incredibly squishy and vulnerable like

1243
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,880
most of them just accept the commands

1244
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,800
they're Sent By Design because if you

1245
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,660
add encryption it's another potential

1246
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,220
layer of failure where the process

1247
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,980
doesn't work right and somebody dies you

1248
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,599
want the big red button on the wall to

1249
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,520
work when you press it you want that to

1250
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,500
be as simple as possible so when you hit

1251
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,420
the emergency stop it stops and there's

1252
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,579
no encryption decryption delay or

1253
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,800
something these systems are vulnerable

1254
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,839
by Design so we have to think of other

1255
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,940
ways to mitigate the cyber security

1256
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,619
risks things like controlling remote

1257
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:19,260
access and architecture and isolation of

1258
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,000
systems but they still have to be

1259
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,339
accessible remotely because now post

1260
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:24,839
covid you know there's a lot of remote

1261
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,579
work there's a lot of remote distributed

1262
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:29,220
operations a lot of remote access is

1263
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,960
required so we have to think about how

1264
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,940
to do that securely too so it's it's

1265
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,280
challenging it's really challenging

1266
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,560
so the real solutions for this stuff if

1267
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,880
you're thinking about like maybe getting

1268
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,560
involved in this as an organization or

1269
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,119
as an individual

1270
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,099
you have to think about processes

1271
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,140
holistically that means the environment

1272
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,880
and the assets

1273
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,440
you have to think about how to build

1274
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,060
these mitigating controls into your

1275
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,280
architecture how to control remote

1276
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,619
access how to secure these very very

1277
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,660
squishy vulnerable systems that are that

1278
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,579
way for a reason

1279
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,319
yes they have a hundred vulnerabilities

1280
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,240
some of them are just always going to

1281
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,740
have 100 vulnerabilities that's good to

1282
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,180
know because you know you need to really

1283
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,280
secure that system but you're probably

1284
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,720
never going to be able to do something

1285
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,040
about it

1286
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,440
you need to rebuild relationships with

1287
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,180
the industrial operators and engineers

1288
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,040
and that's really really hard again

1289
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,380
pastries patience

1290
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,540
and understand that you will never know

1291
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,520
as much about the industrial devices as

1292
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,440
they do it's got to be a collaborative

1293
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,079
effort you've got to go in there with a

1294
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,819
blank State sometimes I call it marriage

1295
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:31,560
counseling because some of these

1296
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,839
relationships are so poor between cyber

1297
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,880
security and engineers in the industrial

1298
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,500
environments because of years of

1299
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,660
miscommunications you've just got to go

1300
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,000
in there with a blank site and act dumb

1301
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,880
and just ask for their help because you

1302
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,619
have to have a good relationship to make

1303
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:48,420
this succeed because you will never know

1304
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,420
as much about the process it's about the

1305
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,300
industrial devices as they do

1306
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,280
you've got to rely a lot on passive

1307
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,900
Technologies we've kind of get we got to

1308
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,220
get into our Bill and Ted Time Machine

1309
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,800
and go back to like 2002 in terms of

1310
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,500
Security Solutions and Monitoring

1311
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,599
Solutions and forensic Solutions in a

1312
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:08,819
lot of cases we use new stuff where we

1313
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,740
can and we need a lot more tooling but

1314
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,900
in a lot of cases we have to rely on

1315
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,880
security methodology from a long time

1316
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,280
ago to deal with these systems

1317
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,560
and we really have to think hard about

1318
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,500
consequence monitoring and consequence

1319
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,000
modeling

1320
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,339
in the near future we're going to see

1321
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,980
more people with this expertise retire a

1322
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,000
lot of them have been in these

1323
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,819
organizations for 30 40 years and they

1324
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:35,160
are retiring now it's a generational

1325
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,200
thing and it's deeply impacting the

1326
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,720
expertise on these systems

1327
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,000
there's still more Divergence in these

1328
