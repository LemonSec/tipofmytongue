2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,679
thank you

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,940
good afternoon everyone I'm going to be

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,379
talking about industrial Control Systems

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,060
which are at the core of all critical

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,580
infrastructure around the world gas

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,980
pipelines water treatment plants the

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,859
electric grid

9
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,599
the potential consequences of attacking

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,980
critical infrastructure of course are

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,300
much different than it systems the the

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,000
ultimate risk here is not the Espionage

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,180
or the theft of data but the loss of

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,920
critical services and functions for a

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,320
prolonged period and potentially maybe

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,600
even death depending on the service

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,420
so in keeping with the theme of the

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,820
conference retro I want to take you back

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,000
to 2007 to the fourth in the series of

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the Bruce Willis films die hard this one

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,660
was a digital version uh focusing on

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,879
terrorists who were conducting a fire

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,339
sale which was a multi-pronged attack

24
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,080
against different kinds of critical

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,420
infrastructure

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,700
this story was based on I don't know if

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,400
you're aware of it was based on a 1979

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,320
book

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,119
The the general story about terrorists

30
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,220
it wasn't a digital book but it was

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,640
based on this the book from 1979 and

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,280
also a 1997 wired story called A

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,299
Farewell to Arms the story was about uh

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,580
um war games that were happening in

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,700
Washington DC looking at scenarios for

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,340
what would happen if attackers targeted

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,860
uh critical infrastructure a lot of

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,119
different critical infrastructure at the

39
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,500
same time in the US while they were

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,540
conducting kinetic attacks in addition

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,420
so kidnapping an ambassador hijacking

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,040
planes dropping bombs on Military

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,040
facilities also then taking out

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,320
digitally Telecom let's say an estate

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,020
taking out Amtrak signals on the train

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,780
stations going from New York to DC air

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,460
traffic control a series of things so

48
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,720
that's what they were looking at at

49
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,479
potential so Hollywood saw this story

50
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,920
decided that this would make a great

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,800
Blockbuster and the original working

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,819
title was ww3.com World War iii.com but

53
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,700
Hollywood producers quickly realized of

54
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,420
course that hacking isn't very visual so

55
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,459
instead we got a lot of this in the film

56
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,900
so nothing driven by digital but

57
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,040
um this movie came out in June 2007 and

58
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,319
uh it turns out that there were actually

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,260
already in the works development of

60
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,520
attacks that would cause physical

61
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,819
destruction using digital means how many

62
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,319
people know about the Aurora generator

63
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,300
test

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,000
not that many okay so the Aurora

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,640
generator test was in March 2007 three

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
months before the Die Hard movie came

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,560
out this was prompted by some

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,599
researchers at Idaho National Lab who

69
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
were asking the question would it be

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,019
possible to cause physical destruction

71
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,940
using nothing more than malicious code

72
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,879
so would it be possible to have code

73
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,500
leap from the digital realm to the

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,720
Physical Realm not just cause some kind

75
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,040
of effect on the computers that they

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,599
were infecting but caused physical

77
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,580
destruction of the equipment that was

78
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,620
being controlled by computers and what

79
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,060
they decided to do was Target their

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,620
attack on something called a protective

81
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,080
relay protective relay is a safety

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
mechanism on the grid it's designed to

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,700
detect when systems are getting into an

84
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,980
unsafe condition so the Grid in the U.S

85
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,319
everything operates at 60 hertz the grid

86
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,879
and all equipment that connects to it

87
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,739
such as a generator

88
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,659
and the protective relay is designed to

89
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,819
detect if that equipment is getting out

90
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,560
of sync or out of phase with the grid

91
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
and if that occurs then the protective

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,580
relay instructs the breakers to open up

93
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,379
and disconnect that equipment from the

94
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,840
grid so disconnect the generator so that

95
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,959
neither the grid suffers any danger and

96
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,260
neither nor does the generator so what

97
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,299
they did was they this is a safety

98
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,980
mechanism so they decided to Target

99
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,140
their attack on that safety mechanism

100
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,060
and actually turn the safety system into

101
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,459
the attack Vector they wrote just 21

102
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,159
lines of code this was a 25 ton

103
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,080
generator that was retired from the oil

104
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,060
fields in Alaska they trucked it out to

105
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,480
Idaho hooked it up to the grid the 21

106
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,760
lines of code were designed to tell to

107
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,478
tell the safety system that an unsafe

108
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,160
condition was actually a safe condition

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,740
so when the generator gets into an

110
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,600
unsafe condition the protective relay

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,520
should prohibit it from joining it back

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,400
to the grid the malicious code told the

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,020
protective relay that that's actually a

114
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,040
safe condition

115
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,680
so they designed a cyclical attack they

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,180
told the protective relay to open the

117
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,919
breaker close the breaker open the

118
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,840
breaker close the breaker and what

119
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,280
happens when you open the breaker and

120
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,199
you disconnect that generator from the

121
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,240
grid the generator is going to speed up

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,979
and start operating at a higher

123
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,780
frequency at that point of course the

124
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,639
protective relay should prevent it from

125
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,460
joining the grid again but the code said

126
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,800
this is okay so they opened the breakers

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,600
closed the breaker open the breaker

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,580
close the breaker each time the breaker

129
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,979
opens the generator starts producing

130
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,199
more energy than the grid can withstand

131
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,600
when the breaker closes again that

132
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,820
excess energy from the generator hits

133
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,340
the slower grid bounces back against the

134
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,840
generator and does this

135
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,620
turn up the sound a little

136
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,820
thank you

137
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,139
and they have the black snow that attack

138
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,479
took three minutes but only because the

139
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,940
engineers built in some pauses into the

140
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,440
attack so that the safety Engineers

141
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,060
could check everything as it was going

142
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,380
they could have done it in just 15

143
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,919
seconds this was a proof of concept we

144
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,080
know already that stuckstead had already

145
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,780
been created at this point and was being

146
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,360
prepared to be Unleashed at Iran I'm not

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,039
going to talk a lot about stockstep I

148
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,900
wrote a book you can actually go go

149
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,520
there if you want for all of the details

150
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,380
but I do want to just talk in sort of

151
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,300
general terms about it because it it

152
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,580
opened our eyes to the dangers of

153
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,440
critical infrastructure and the security

154
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,080
problems with them so stuxnet was

155
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,580
Unleashed if there were two versions

156
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,020
that were discovered the first one was

157
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,300
Unleashed in 2007 the second version

158
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,860
that was discovered was Unleashed in

159
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,100
2009 it was re-released again in 2010.

160
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,560
what stuxnet did was it was looking for

161
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,360
industrial control systems made by the

162
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,060
German company Siemens so stuxnet was a

163
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,160
worm it would travel to Windows systems

164
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,440
and infect window systems but it would

165
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,360
only unleash its payload if it found a

166
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,880
very very specific configuration of

167
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,560
industrial control systems at the

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,600
facility that it was infecting so once

169
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,280
it got onto a system it was searching

170
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,100
for the presence of Siemens industrial

171
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,900
control system software called wincc

172
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,660
which is used to program a component

173
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,580
called a programmable logic controller a

174
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,979
PLC it was also looking for software

175
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,199
called Step 7 and that is used to

176
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,759
monitor the processes that are

177
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,099
controlled by a PLC and then it was

178
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,800
looking for two specific models of

179
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,960
Siemens PLC the S7 315 PLC and the s7417

180
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,660
PLC and what stuxtent did when it got

181
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,639
onto those systems would Target the

182
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,020
components that were being controlled by

183
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,620
those two plcs the s7417 is a high-end

184
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,780
Siemens PLC it cost about ten thousand

185
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,180
dollars and it was controlling the exit

186
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,460
valves on centrifuges so what happened

187
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,800
was the way that the enrichment process

188
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,020
works is uranium hexafluoride gas is

189
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,000
pumped into the centrifuge right here

190
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,280
through pi types at the top of it and

191
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,840
then there's a rotor inside that spins

192
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,819
at supersonic speeds separating the

193
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,500
Isotopes that are needed for nuclear

194
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,180
fission from the Isotopes that aren't

195
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,280
needed and that enriched uranium with

196
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,020
the Isotopes that are needed are then

197
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,180
scraped out one of those other pipes and

198
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,220
sent into another batch of centrifuges

199
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,560
to be further enriched so in this case

200
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,139
stuxnet closed the exit valves so that

201
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,879
gas could get in but it couldn't get out

202
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,400
the other attack was targeting the S7

203
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,740
315 and that was controlling frequency

204
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,379
converters which were controlling the uh

205
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,660
the electricity going to spinning the

206
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,760
centrifuges so what happened in these

207
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,860
two separate attacks the first attack

208
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,020
was actually the one that targeted the

209
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,020
417 this was one Unleashed in 2007 like

210
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,640
I said it controlled the exit valves

211
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,919
when stuxnet got on the PLC it didn't

212
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,140
initially begin the sabotage it actually

213
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,959
recorded normal operations of the PLC

214
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,580
and the centrifuges that they were

215
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,560
controlling and it stored that data

216
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,660
until it needed it then at the end of 30

217
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,540
days the attack the sabotage begins and

218
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,339
stocks that starts closing the exit

219
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,320
valves like I said the gas is going in

220
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,360
but it's not getting out and what

221
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,980
happens when that gas goes into the

222
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,720
centrifuge and it can't get out is the

223
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,459
pressure inside the centrifuge starts to

224
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,620
increase and so they wait until for

225
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,420
about two hours or until the pressure is

226
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,980
increased about five times what is

227
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,680
normal and during that period it takes

228
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,260
the um the data that it recorded during

229
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,420
that initial 30 days showing the normal

230
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,640
operations of the plant it feeds that

231
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,800
data now to the monitor to the monitors

232
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,240
so the operators are looking at their

233
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,820
screens they see pressure is okay all

234
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,620
the all the valves are open they don't

235
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,779
see anything wrong and it also disables

236
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,940
the safety system I like the protective

237
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,100
relay on the grid the centrifuges had a

238
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,240
safety system that was supposed to

239
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,940
detect if it got out into a set unsafe

240
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,500
condition and then it would shut down

241
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,959
the centrifuges so it disabled that so

242
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,880
it couldn't stop and then at the end of

243
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,260
the sabotage at the end of those two

244
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,420
hours rinse and repeat it goes back to

245
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,760
30 days recording normal operations and

246
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,740
then another round of sabotage and what

247
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,300
that tells us is that the attackers were

248
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
not after one-time catastrophic damage

249
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,220
but they were looking to do incremental

250
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,320
damage over its time that would be hard

251
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,600
to detect and hard to point the Iranian

252
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,980
Engineers would see that they're having

253
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,839
problems with the enrichment process but

254
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,339
they wouldn't be able to figure out what

255
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,560
was going on or anticipate what might

256
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,779
happen next the other attack this one

257
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,120
was launched in 2009 in June and then

258
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,640
again in March 2010 like I said it

259
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,380
targeted a different PLC which was

260
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,120
controlling the frequency converters

261
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,300
this one had a similar plan it would sit

262
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,160
on the system wouldn't initially do the

263
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,220
sabotage record normal operations and

264
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,959
then this time when the sabotage began

265
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,820
instead of closing exit valves it

266
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,080
increased the frequency of the

267
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,300
centrifuges for only about 15 minutes

268
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,240
but that that frequency was about the

269
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,500
maximum that these particular

270
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
centrifuges could withstand because they

271
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
weren't really built very well their

272
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,920
first generation centrifuges and then at

273
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,160
the second stage stuxnet would reduce

274
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,700
the frequency for uh sorry it would

275
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,260
reduce the frequency to Norm normal and

276
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,060
then waited 26 days and during the next

277
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,800
round of the attack would reduce it to

278
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,899
two Hertz for about 50 minutes and I'll

279
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,420
go into what that effect would have but

280
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,860
during that period they did the same

281
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,779
thing they fed that false data they

282
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,519
disabled the safety system and again

283
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,740
rinse and repeat cyclical

284
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,260
so what are the consequences when that

285
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,300
gas is going into the centrifuge and it

286
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,500
can't get out and the pressure is

287
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,660
increasing that gas starts to solidify

288
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,640
and so it starts to get caught on that

289
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
rotor inside the centrifuge and you're

290
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,720
going to start to damage the the rotors

291
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,160
and the centrifuge that might scrape

292
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,200
against the inside of the centrifuge

293
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,899
Iran had a limited supply of uranium

294
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,820
hexafluoride gas that it purchased

295
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,860
illicitly from China and they had a

296
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,600
limited supply of materials with which

297
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,120
to build new centrifuges the aim here

298
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,459
was to buy time for diplomacy to work to

299
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,680
 the enrichment process slow it

300
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,660
down until they could bring the Iranians

301
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,279
to the table and get some kind of

302
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,440
agreement with them so these these two

303
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,480
attacks would both waste the gas that

304
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,540
Iran had and waste centrifuge material

305
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,220
and this is sort of the sabotage at a

306
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,500
glance you can see the pink lines the

307
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,360
number of centrifuges being stalled is a

308
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,579
growing the amount of enriched uranium

309
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,579
is not and uh the other Pro that I

310
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,019
didn't mention when you when you speed

311
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,459
up and slow down the centrifugation

312
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:12,839
speed up and slow down you're actually

313
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,060
sabotaging management process itself

314
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,980
because the enrichment needs the

315
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,899
centrifuges to be spinning at a uniform

316
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,940
speed for a long period of time and when

317
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,860
you speed up and slow down and speed up

318
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,380
and slow down those Center the Isotopes

319
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,240
that have been separated start to come

320
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,399
back together and so the Iranians at the

321
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,899
end of that process were expecting to

322
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,760
get uranium enriched to a certain level

323
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,500
and what they were actually getting was

324
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,959
something enriched at this level

325
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,540
so I talk about that because it it

326
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,700
created all kinds of implications for

327
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,279
the security of The Wider family of

328
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,779
industrial control systems that were

329
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,060
being used the IT world the security

330
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,560
world wasn't paying attention to

331
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,660
Industrial Control Systems until staxnet

332
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,300
there was a very small minority of

333
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
people who specialized in this area

334
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,860
vendors weren't creating secure systems

335
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,920
and once this uh stuxnet put industrial

336
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,779
control systems on the map in particular

337
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,180
plcs and other components then people

338
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,040
started looking at these systems and

339
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,480
they found that they were never designed

340
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,940
with security in mind no authentication

341
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,579
no encryption vulnerabilities and

342
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,920
protocols the systems were promiscuous

343
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,620
they would communicate with any device

344
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,300
so a lot of problems that couldn't be

345
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,160
patched there were problems that needed

346
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,019
re-architecting

347
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,940
so these are some of the industrial

348
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,740
control systems that exist you probably

349
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,200
are all aware of the scada system

350
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,060
um these are used for large geographical

351
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,260
areas

352
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,700
um for like gas pipelines water

353
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,980
distribution distributed Control Systems

354
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,920
more contained systems environments and

355
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,860
then some components the plcs and rtu

356
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,260
remote terminal unit so I want to talk

357
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,660
in particular about the plcs because

358
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,360
that's what stuxnet exposed first plcs

359
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,279
were designed in the 1960s for the

360
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,380
automotive industry to try and automate

361
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,839
processes they weren't digital yet they

362
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,639
replaced hardwired relay geologic

363
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,620
systems and then in the 1990s they

364
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,240
started to become digitized and they

365
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,459
also started to become connected to the

366
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,760
internet via modem for remote access

367
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,620
these were proprietary systems so no one

368
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,639
was really concerned about the security

369
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,019
actually no one was even talking about

370
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,820
security at that point but they were

371
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,860
proprietary systems so the real harm

372
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,600
would have come from insiders who had

373
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,940
that specialized knowledge of these

374
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,480
systems and then what changed however

375
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,220
was in the late 90s we had a lot of

376
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,079
Regulation start to get introduced

377
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,700
especially before the environment in the

378
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,040
U.S and when you have that regulation it

379
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,320
means that in the past only Engineers

380
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,360
needed to have access to that process

381
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,300
control data and so they had access to

382
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,639
the primary proprietary systems but now

383
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,139
you needed people in the legal office

384
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,480
you needed the the company lawyers you

385
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,519
needed Regulators you needed a lot of

386
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,139
other people in the business offices to

387
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,300
be able to access that same data and

388
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,740
they needed systems that could actually

389
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,660
communicate with those systems so

390
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,399
everything sort of migrated to Windows

391
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,220
PCS and in that migration then it opened

392
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,440
up to a world of vulnerabilities that of

393
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,000
course were already inherent in the

394
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,519
windows commercial systems so I said

395
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,440
these systems control all critical

396
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,060
infrastructure around the world this is

397
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,740
sort of a sample of what they are

398
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,480
controlling power plants water treatment

399
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,060
plants reservoirs and dams car assembly

400
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,160
lines chemical pharmaceutical food and

401
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,500
beverage plants they they control the

402
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,899
temperature at which food is pasteurized

403
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,699
and so you imagine that if someone can

404
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,279
actually alter that temperature you can

405
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,100
introduce food into the markets that

406
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,899
could potentially cause sickness that

407
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,459
control elevators heating and air

408
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,079
conditioning in schools and hospitals

409
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,420
that control traffic lights furnaces and

410
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,760
Kilns where glass fiberglass and steel

411
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,160
are made again if you can control how

412
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,899
the material is made if you can alter it

413
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,240
or undermine it in some way then you can

414
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,399
affect the Integrity of that the

415
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,220
material they also control the routing

416
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,260
of commuter and freight trains keep them

417
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,660
from crashing and they lower and raise

418
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,139
draw bridges over waterways and they

419
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,180
also operate cell doors at high security

420
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,279
prisons

421
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,279
in 2011 I wrote a story about some

422
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,959
researchers who gave a presentation at

423
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,000
the Defcon hacker conference they were

424
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,459
invited in by a prison in the U.S to

425
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,620
conduct a pen test to see if they could

426
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,540
actually hack the systems that are

427
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,180
controlling the prison and lo and behold

428
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,459
they discovered that there were plcs on

429
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,380
a laptop or a desktop computer that

430
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,800
controlling the uh the prison doors and

431
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,480
these were the same desktop systems that

432
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,279
the guards were using to read their

433
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,500
email surf the Internet and so of course

434
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,940
they were able to get there and

435
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,760
undermine the system so that was 2011.

436
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,300
in 2013 I came across this story that

437
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,940
described uh how at a high security Wing

438
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,920
at a prison suddenly all of the doors

439
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,779
sprung open they called it a computer

440
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,060
glitch we never got to the bottom of

441
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,680
what actually happened here but I

442
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,980
thought that the conjunction or the the

443
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,899
it wasn't a coincidence let's say I

444
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,100
don't think it was a coincidence that

445
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,920
the research was published in 2011 and

446
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,139
then you had that in 213. and then in

447
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,199
2015 if any of you watched Mr Robot you

448
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,599
might remember that he used this attack

449
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,839
uh to O to Target the plcs at a prison

450
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,939
in order to Spring open all the prison

451
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,419
doors and free a drug addict uh Elliot

452
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,160
so here where you we see it going

453
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,740
through the systems here he decided to

454
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,280
go through a laptop in a patrol car the

455
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,160
patrol car visits the prison

456
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,780
communicates uh through the to the

457
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,460
prison Network through that patrol car

458
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,640
drops the exploits on the laptop gets it

459
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,580
into the prison Network and then because

460
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,320
all of the cell doors open

461
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,240
simultaneously it causes a power surge

462
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,780
power goes out doors all open and

463
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,059
everyone is sprung free

464
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,480
so uh turns out also that industrial

465
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,280
control systems are in weapon systems

466
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,900
this is not something that I knew for a

467
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,780
long time this comes from a report a

468
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,700
government report in the U.S from 2018

469
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,160
that's a fake weapon that they put

470
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,679
together as an illustration they don't

471
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,539
go into a lot of detail about how the

472
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,520
industrial control systems are used but

473
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,720
they're generally used to automate

474
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,240
systems Control process and have other

475
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,820
systems communicate in a centralized way

476
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,220
[Music]

477
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,840
um

478
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
clicker's not working

479
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,340
can you advance the slide for me

480
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,820
Ronan

481
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,799
ah there we go so this was the GAO

482
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,419
report from 2018 and I thought this

483
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,700
quote was interesting DOD officials said

484
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,500
that program offices may not know which

485
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,179
industrial control systems are embedded

486
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,400
in their weapon systems or what the

487
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,679
superior security implications of them

488
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:41,820
are and I'm going to talk a little more

489
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,860
about weapon systems later

490
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,840
um but I'll come back to that but I want

491
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,740
to move sort of ahead to get into

492
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,820
attacks that we've seen on Industrial

493
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,860
control systems and potential attacks

494
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,500
after stuxnet was discovered we assumed

495
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,880
that there would be a lot of CopyCat

496
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,500
attacks against critical infrastructure

497
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,360
and surprisingly there weren't for a

498
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,580
while the first one we saw we don't have

499
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,440
a lot of information about this was in

500
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,320
2014 a German steel mill it was a

501
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,179
basically a footnote at the bottom of a

502
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,220
German government report is how we found

503
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,080
out about it they provided very little

504
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,940
information they said that the hackers

505
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,880
got access through a spearfishing not a

506
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,580
spear hushing a spear phishing attack in

507
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,620
the business Network migrated to the

508
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,600
control Network manipulated the control

509
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,880
systems in such a way that a blast

510
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,460
furnace was not able to shut down it

511
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,740
resulted in massive though unspecified

512
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,020
damage they weren't clear about it and

513
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,340
they said the attackers possessed

514
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,780
Advanced knowledge of how industrial

515
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,179
control systems work so that's sort of

516
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,799
the first sign of course you are all

517
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,539
familiar with the what happened in

518
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,740
Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. 2015 one is a

519
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,419
particular importance

520
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,059
so this was in the middle of winter it

521
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,380
happened around five o'clock in the

522
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,419
afternoon suddenly the electricity goes

523
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,880
out workers are coming home from work

524
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,980
they're turning on the heat at home

525
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,740
they're getting ready to cook dinner and

526
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,299
then all the electricity goes out for

527
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,120
about 250 000 customers the attackers

528
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,980
came in again through a fishing attack

529
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,900
in the business Network in the spring of

530
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,380
2015 they immediately stole credentials

531
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,660
for the workers for the VPN moved back

532
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,120
out of the network came back in as those

533
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,919
employees and then spent six months

534
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,720
conducting reconnaissance and designing

535
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,640
attack when they finally did the attack

536
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,760
in December 2015 they attacked three

537
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,039
distribution plants simultaneously they

538
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,660
they were three plants were all using

539
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,340
different industrial Control Systems so

540
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,020
they had to design different attacks for

541
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,020
these what they did was they took out 60

542
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,179
substations were taken offline opening

543
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,400
the breakers on them but at the same

544
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,020
time that they did that they also

545
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,059
launched a telephony denial of service

546
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,039
attack against the customer call center

547
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,500
so customers are being uh thrown into

548
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,080
the dark and they are picking up the

549
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,280
phone to call the call center and they

550
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,360
can't get through because there's a

551
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,000
denial of service at the same time uh

552
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,340
well actually the so the workers inside

553
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,200
the plants don't know what's going on

554
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,780
they look at their operating stations

555
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,700
they see that electricity is Flowing

556
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,799
they don't see any problem and the first

557
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,179
sign of problem was when one of the

558
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,520
workers looks at his uh

559
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,500
sorry it says monitoring screen and he

560
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,059
sees that the cursor starts moving

561
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,880
without any evolution of his so he sees

562
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,440
it moving realizes that there's someone

563
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,480
inside the network immediately tries to

564
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,160
take control of it they kick him out

565
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,440
change the password he can't get in and

566
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,600
then the hackers realize that they've

567
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,419
been that everyone is aware now they cut

568
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,240
backup power to the control rooms so as

569
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,799
The Operators are scrambling to try and

570
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,120
figure out what's going on suddenly

571
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,280
they're they're in some confusion in the

572
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,320
dark they start wiping operator station

573
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,840
so they can't recover and then when they

574
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,760
do try to recover it turns out that the

575
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,340
attackers had overwritten the firmware

576
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,280
um on at the rtus at 16 substations so

577
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,500
they couldn't send remote commands to

578
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,780
restore uh to reclose The Breakers and

579
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,880
restore our power they had to then drive

580
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,000
out physically to the field and manually

581
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,460
close those Breakers

582
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,860
so this is a video that was taken by one

583
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,360
of the operators at one of the plants

584
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,220
showing the hackers controlling the

585
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,640
cursor

586
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,980
uh

587
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,280
foreign

588
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,380
foreign

589
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,200
so I love how casual and curious they

590
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,940
are about all this and one of them says

591
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,500
we need to call the it guys wait wait

592
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,679
what if it is the it guys so that was

593
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,159
the 2015 the next attack we see uh goes

594
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,039
to the next stage of danger this was in

595
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,620
2015 maybe we are many of you are all

596
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,539
really aware of the Triton attack this

597
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,059
targeted a petrochemical and refinery in

598
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,360
Saudi Arabia uh this time the attackers

599
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,679
again that came in from their business

600
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,179
Network they make their way to the

601
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,980
process Network are you seeing a plan

602
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,440
here you're seeing a repeat modus

603
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,659
operandi they compromised six

604
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,179
controllers overwrote the devices the

605
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,620
first hint that something was going on

606
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,100
was uh when they the system shut down so

607
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,419
what they were targeting here was the

608
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,600
safety mechanisms like stuxnet did right

609
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,580
undermining that the Integrity of that

610
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,919
safety system here the safety system is

611
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,960
designed to shut down the refinery if

612
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,580
it's getting into a maybe a chemical

613
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,520
spill or an unsafe condition in this

614
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,799
case their code was written badly it had

615
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,659
a flaw and it actually triggered the

616
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,640
safety system to operate in exactly the

617
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,440
way it should operate it shut down the

618
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,299
Plant

619
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:38,460
the workers at the plant gave the

620
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,840
controller sent the controller to the

621
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,340
manufacturer they were looking for what

622
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,659
kind of problem might have caused it

623
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,700
they couldn't find anything they opened

624
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,740
the plant up again and then in August it

625
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,200
happens again and then that's when they

626
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,179
take a closer look they bring in some

627
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,860
forensic investigators and then they do

628
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,780
find the malware and it was eventually

629
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,460
traced that but when you're going after

630
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,200
the safety mask in this amount system

631
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,480
then especially if I had a chemical

632
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,520
plant then the potential there is a

633
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,100
possibility of a major chemical spill

634
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,260
that could potentially cause death so

635
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,059
now we're getting into much more serious

636
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,400
kinds of tax we see that Russia has an

637
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,000
interest in this kind of opportunity

638
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,280
and so that's where attacks could be

639
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,679
going in the future

640
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,760
um it's not advancing again

641
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,159
so this was something that was

642
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,400
discovered in 2022 around the time that

643
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,360
the invasion was occurring at in Ukraine

644
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,260
researchers and government U.S

645
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,179
government discovered this modular first

646
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,720
little tool toolkit this is now a fully

647
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,299
functional fully featured toolkit that's

648
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,740
designed specifically to go after

649
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,360
industrial control systems and

650
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,940
potentially cause disruption denial of

651
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,700
services and destruction there's not a

652
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,200
lot of information available about this

653
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,820
they're not being very open about it

654
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,320
they haven't told us where they

655
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,940
discovered it but they've implied that

656
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,799
it was never actually deployed which

657
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,020
suggests that maybe someone hacked into

658
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,240
the hackers computers and found the

659
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,860
toolkit or maybe it was on a staging

660
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,000
server or something we don't know

661
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,559
they're not being very clear about it

662
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,659
but again it means that they're they're

663
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,279
setting the stage for these kinds of

664
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,840
attacks

665
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,700
so Colonial pipeline right you don't

666
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,500
need actually a sophisticated attack to

667
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,059
take down control uh to take down

668
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,220
control processes this one of course was

669
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,659
a ransomware attack against the it

670
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,520
Network in this case there was an

671
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,440
operator that had a machine on his

672
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,779
desktop which was for the it Network he

673
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,520
had a separate machine on the desktop

674
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,140
right next to it for the operational

675
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,360
Network he sees the ransomware kick in

676
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,940
on the it Network panics and shuts down

677
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,159
the iot network because he's afraid that

678
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,659
it's going to pass they the company

679
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,820
insists that this two two networks were

680
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,520
segmented and but this guy panics shuts

681
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,400
it down 5 500 miles of pipeline shut

682
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,740
down oil is not flowing to the east

683
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,340
coast and then of course uh what happens

684
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,039
is that the attackers didn't Design This

685
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,900
they never intended this but the

686
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,299
consequence is that the reaction of the

687
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,460
public to this is that there's a panic

688
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,380
and a run-on gas and then there becomes

689
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,760
a gas shortage there wasn't actually a

690
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,559
gas shortage but there was a run on the

691
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,720
gas that created a shortage and then uh

692
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,760
same year the old Smart Water Treatment

693
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,400
Plant in Florida hackers got in and

694
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,200
raised the level of lie the chemical for

695
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,419
the water from 100 parts per million to

696
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,580
11 000 parts per million an alert

697
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,179
operator saw it changed it back but the

698
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,700
system had no security at all they were

699
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,260
using an unsupported Windows operating

700
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,360
system the control system was connected

701
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,520
to the internet without any uh real

702
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,860
protection and The Operators were all

703
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,480
using the same password that had

704
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,340
actually been leaked to the internet in

705
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,500
a hack so

706
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,799
this is what uh the control system looks

707
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,299
like on the internet not very

708
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,659
sophisticated right 1980s Maybe

709
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,760
so this is Jason Larson he's a

710
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,320
researcher or was a researcher at Idaho

711
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,360
National Lab this was a demonstration

712
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,460
that he gave at Defcon many years ago

713
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,220
where he was looking at hacking a barrel

714
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,620
at a chemical plant and the hack was

715
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,659
really simple he designed it to increase

716
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,700
the heat inside the barrel at the same

717
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,320
time that he was simultaneously

718
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,360
decreasing the pressure inside

719
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,100
should I play that again

720
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,159
if anyone who didn't see it

721
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,779
watch the barrel behind him

722
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,179
so uh like I said we have we don't have

723
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,100
a lot of examples of these kinds of

724
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,840
attacks going on but we see the

725
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,880
preparation we see a lot of interest in

726
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,320
these kinds of attacks

727
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,900
but hackers study accidents that happen

728
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,000
in the industrial sector in order to see

729
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,320
the consequences to see the

730
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,940
vulnerabilities and then potentially

731
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,500
design attacks that would have the same

732
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,659
consequences so I want to talk for a bit

733
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,820
about some accidents that have occurred

734
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,039
in the U.S

735
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,620
in particular because they have an

736
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,179
industrial control system element to

737
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,159
them but they weren't caused by hackers

738
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,980
so this occurred in 2010 in my state in

739
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,020
California San Bruno pipeline explosion

740
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,419
uh killed eight people destroyed 38

741
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,100
homes what happened here is that

742
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,720
maintenance workers were working on the

743
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,700
network and they cut electricity to the

744
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,380
network while they were doing that and

745
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,880
what happened when they cut electricity

746
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,100
to the network is that the pipeline was

747
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,860
designed to fail open the valves were

748
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,779
supposed to fail open which is what you

749
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,640
want right you cut you lose electricity

750
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,679
you want customers to continue to

751
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,899
receive gas to their homes the problem

752
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,419
is is that this particular pipeline had

753
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,100
a flaw it had already had a crack in it

754
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,500
from a backhoe that had dug too deep

755
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,440
into the dirt and so the gas continues

756
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,659
to put to pour into this pipeline the

757
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,399
pressure increases exactly like those

758
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,860
centrifuges in Iran and then eventually

759
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,960
it explodes and it causes this but what

760
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,700
was happening is also that when they cut

761
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,200
the electricity to the industrial

762
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,179
Control Systems The Operators lost

763
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,820
visual lost visual

764
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,860
um uh oversight of what actually was

765
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,140
happening they were looking at a static

766
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,179
screen they no longer realized that they

767
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,500
weren't looking at a real-time screen

768
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,240
and they couldn't see that the pressure

769
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,360
was increasing inside the pipeline

770
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,360
this occurred in 1999 in Bellingham

771
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,340
Washington with the Olympic pipeline

772
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,220
company 237 000 gallons of gasoline

773
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,399
spored in poured into a Waterway

774
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:15,360
customers in the neighborhood were

775
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,919
calling up the company saying we smell

776
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,620
gasoline we smell gas The Operators are

777
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,880
looking at their monitors they see

778
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,340
nothing no sign of a leak eventually it

779
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,260
ignited killed two ten-year-old boys in

780
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,320
a park and a teen when investigators

781
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,880
started looking at what happened here

782
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,140
and looking at the networks they

783
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,399
discovered that the networks weren't

784
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,919
segmented properly they did have a

785
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,080
bridge between them that wasn't fully

786
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,820
secured hackers could have come in

787
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,440
through the business Network moved their

788
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,539
way to the process Network there's no

789
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,100
sign that that's what happened but back

790
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,500
in 1990 1999 we really weren't looking

791
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,440
for that the other thing was that the

792
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,419
control system and the safety system

793
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,440
which should have kicked in

794
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,940
automatically even if the operators

795
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,740
didn't know what was going on the safety

796
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,240
system sort of kicked in and it didn't

797
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,580
The Operators looked at their at their

798
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,200
their monitoring stations they didn't

799
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,360
see any change if the safety system saw

800
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,399
change it certainly didn't kick in and

801
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,080
shut down that Pipeline and divert the

802
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,059
gas so who knows really what happened

803
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,320
there I don't think we have a really

804
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,299
thorough investigation

805
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,220
this is just a fun thing London Tower

806
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,120
Bridge in 2021 uh got stuck open over

807
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,559
the Waterway for about six to eight

808
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,020
hours uh they were referring to it as a

809
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,279
software glitch remember that prison

810
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,380
prison cells opening and other software

811
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,700
glitch

812
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,200
um required a team of Engineers to

813
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,240
investigate they eventually replaced

814
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,039
faulty relays we never really got a

815
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,140
clear answer about what happened I

816
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,059
decided to just do a little research to

817
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,380
see if I could figure out what kind of

818
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,240
control systems they're using this was

819
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,700
five minutes uh got through the Rockwell

820
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,520
automations system even figured out

821
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,500
where the PLC is it's situated in the

822
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Northwest Pier Machinery room uh they're

823
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,480
communicating via Viber optic cable coax

824
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,480
cables to a remote plx X and the four

825
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,820
Piers a lot of information in five

826
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,740
minutes

827
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,899
trains I want to talk about those for a

828
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,640
minute uh you probably are familiar with

829
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,520
this one going back to 2008 the train

830
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,039
system in Lutz Poland was using infrared

831
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,700
to communicate commands to the tracks in

832
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,520
order to switch them the train uh the 14

833
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,340
year old decided to modify a TV remote

834
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,559
and use the infrared to switch the

835
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,820
tracks uh he derailed four trams uh hurt

836
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,059
some people this is the DC Metro crash

837
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,000
in June 2009 in Washington DC at commute

838
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,240
hour killed nine people injured 80. what

839
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,559
happened in this case was that the

840
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,600
sensors on the tracks failed so there

841
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,799
are sensors on the tracks that are

842
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,840
supposed to indicate if there's a if

843
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,820
there's a train that is stopped at a

844
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,919
station so that any incoming trains will

845
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,380
know that and slow down or stop before

846
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,600
they get there the sensors on this track

847
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,880
at this station failed an incoming train

848
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,200
didn't realize that there was a train

849
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,960
stopped in front of them the operator at

850
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,940
the last minute was too late to engage

851
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,820
the brake and it ran into the train in

852
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,620
front of it the interesting thing is

853
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,740
that in 1999 there were faulty relays

854
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,140
found on the DC Metro that were sending

855
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,480
incorrect instructions to trains so they

856
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,980
were telling one train to travel 45

857
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,840
miles per hour in a 15 mile per hour

858
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,679
zone so the potential to create an

859
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,919
intentional attack like this to

860
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:22,740
undermine Those sensors is there this

861
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,659
was a fatal derailment in northeast

862
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,179
regional train in 2015 eight people dead

863
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,460
about 200 injured what happened in this

864
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,960
case was there was a train that was hit

865
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,700
by a rock and there was a lot of

866
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,399
communication going on with other

867
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,799
operators other trains telling asking

868
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,240
them to look out for anyone along the

869
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,580
tracks who might be throwing rocks a lot

870
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,919
of just the radio communication going on

871
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,200
and the engineer was distracted and when

872
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,539
he got distracted he was going around a

873
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,700
bend and didn't slow down and the Train

874
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,059
derailed now a lot of the trains in in

875
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,779
that Metro uh family use positive train

876
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,539
control which it takes the operator out

877
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,059
of the equation right so it's automatic

878
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,100
it knows when it needs to slow down when

879
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,339
it's coming up to a Bend but this train

880
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,199
didn't wasn't equipped with that the

881
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,399
thing is is that when you start to

882
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,199
automate that kind of activity and you

883
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,699
take the operator out of the equation

884
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,260
you take the human out of the equation

885
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,359
you're also opening up another potential

886
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,940
attack Vector to undermine that

887
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,339
automated system there was a researcher

888
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,139
who decided to look at that train system

889
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,239
after this derailment and to see if they

890
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,560
actually had vulnerabilities that

891
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,418
someone could use to design an

892
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,639
intentional attack he discovered the

893
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,199
things that we always discover in these

894
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,119
kinds of cases right no authentication

895
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,599
of commands unencrypted communication

896
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:40,560
promiscuous system that will communicate

897
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,899
with anything vulnerabilities in the

898
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,359
communication protocol and also by the

899
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,219
way a cabinet at the end of each

900
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,320
business and Coach class car that gives

901
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,239
anyone on the train direct access to the

902
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,460
electronics

903
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,320
trains of course have a lot of potential

904
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,119
attack vectors through the thickening

905
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,040
and Gate Systems credit card processing

906
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,619
systems Advertising Signs Lighting

907
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,580
systems CCTV in 2015 some researchers

908
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,500
decided to put up a honey train a honey

909
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,020
pot they put up a fake trained Network

910
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,760
to see what kind of Interest it would

911
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,460
get and got three million probes and

912
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,079
then some breaches as well over six

913
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,119
weeks some of the hackers gain control

914
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,820
in about 10 percent of the cases that

915
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,800
kept coming back and coming back and

916
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,079
digging probing deeper and deeper into

917
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,420
that Network

918
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,599
um okay so some of you are aware of this

919
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,000
kind of activity we are already seeing

920
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,339
targeting of train systems uh and also

921
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,040
gas stations of course uh attributed to

922
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,680
Israel uh wiper paralyzing systems

923
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,300
posting Fake Messages is about

924
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,060
cancellations electronic display signs

925
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,980
defaced with messages telling passengers

926
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,359
to call the ayatula khamenei's uh office

927
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:52,680
and in this case with the gas stations

928
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,359
they disabled a government-issued smart

929
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,420
card that are used for purchasing fuel

930
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,000
that is subsidized by the government so

931
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,640
no one's cards were working fuel became

932
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,400
unavailable via the cards at more than 4

933
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,780
000 gas stations around the country they

934
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,880
could still get gas at a much higher

935
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,460
price at some stations and again they

936
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,740
displayed this message with a phone

937
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,060
number to call the Commander's office

938
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,460
and then they also

939
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,720
digital signs over highways

940
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,060
so I want to go back uh in the time that

941
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,040
I have left uh just to look at the

942
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,900
weapon systems a bit

943
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,700
um because this is I think a little

944
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,440
about the future that hasn't really been

945
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,200
explored much this is a report from the

946
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,820
government accountability office in the

947
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,900
U.S

948
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,700
um these kinds of reports are created

949
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,400
they dig deep uh investigators can spend

950
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,960
a couple of years doing these they

951
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,420
create these reports for lawmakers at

952
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,060
Congress and in this particular report

953
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,060
they focused on weapon systems and their

954
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,099
conclusion the summary was that despite

955
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,619
warnings security warnings years and

956
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,960
years of security warnings the dod

957
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,579
hadn't been paying attention to

958
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,800
prioritizing the security of weapon

959
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,200
systems so what they found here was

960
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,760
there were a lot of mission critical

961
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,960
vulnerabilities that were being

962
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,700
routinely found in systems that were

963
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,859
under development they had poor password

964
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,020
management default passwords that

965
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,880
weren't getting changed unencrypted

966
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,040
Communications testers were able to

967
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,540
seize control of weapon systems

968
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,720
undetected in one case a two-person team

969
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,780
took just one hour for initial access

970
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,140
and then just a day for full control

971
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,599
in one case they were able to cause

972
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,000
parts of a system to shut down simply by

973
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,060
scanning the system and as a joke they

974
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,520
had an alert pop up in one case saying

975
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,140
please insert some quarters to continue

976
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,799
operating

977
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,579
um

978
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,160
so the weapon systems uh many of them

979
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,540
you would think they're not connected to

980
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,800
the internet but they do have

981
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,440
communication uh they have a lot of

982
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,900
potential avenues for attack they have

983
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,940
radio communications receivers radar

984
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,280
receivers USB ports for potential

985
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,200
Insider attacks

986
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,660
um this of course fake weapon again for

987
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,420
illustrative purposes

988
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,420
um

989
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,839
so this is 2021 the NSA is getting so

990
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,760
concerned that DOD hasn't taken this

991
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,460
very seriously and is basically telling

992
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,020
them to lock down your weapon systems

993
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,599
before the hackers get to them in terms

994
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,700
of weapon systems we have computers on

995
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,280
wings at Sea and on land none of them

996
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,200
work without computers this is Rob Joyce

997
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,300
head of an NSA directorate so you've got

998
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,760
computers controlling firing Precision

999
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,640
aiming GPS navigation and Communications

1000
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,040
voice and data all potentially attack

1001
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,780
vectors this was something that I put in

1002
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,339
the book this is just like a footnote in

1003
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:42,540
the book

1004
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,160
um this occurred in South Africa in

1005
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,099
2007. this is a German swish swish

1006
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,800
German Swiss weapon they were testing

1007
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,480
the weapon and of course it's shooting

1008
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,520
and then all of a sudden it spins around

1009
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,320
and it starts shooting the soldiers that

1010
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,480
are standing behind the weapon nine

1011
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,060
soldiers killed 14 injured initially

1012
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,380
they were saying that it was software

1013
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,300
glitch there's that word again software

1014
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,040
glitch with someone a little

1015
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,900
investigation what they came out with a

1016
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,200
report that it wasn't a digital issue it

1017
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,140
was a mechanical issue a spring pin just

1018
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,359
the size of a Matchstick was responsible

1019
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,579
for switching the system from mechanical

1020
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,460
to from manual to electronic got sheared

1021
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,740
off and that triggered the system to

1022
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,119
just start firing

1023
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,619
and then there's supposed to be these

1024
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,900
protectors that prevents the gun from

1025
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,859
moving uh Beyond a certain limit and

1026
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:33,720
somehow it just basically broke through

1027
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,940
those barriers and switched slipped

1028
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,200
around and started shooting the soldiers

1029
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,420
behind it again do we trust the reports

1030
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,280
I don't know there's not a lot of

1031
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,800
transparency here we know that the

1032
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,540
manufacturer fought back and said that

1033
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,140
it wasn't any kind of software glitch

1034
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:52,200
but anyways mechanical failures

1035
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,980
this is 2014. this was reported by the

1036
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,560
New York Times They said that Obama had

1037
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,320
ordered digital sabotage of North Korean

1038
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,760
missiles

1039
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,500
um what we saw was that were there were

1040
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,060
a lot of a lot of testing of North

1041
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,099
Korean missiles going on some of them

1042
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:09,720
were successful but a lot of them were

1043
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,820
exploding upon launch uh veering off

1044
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,920
course disintegrating in midair plunging

1045
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,619
into the sea the New York Times reports

1046
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:17,940
that it's unclear which of these are

1047
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,700
sabotaged but it was a case of what

1048
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,380
they're calling left of launch where

1049
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,700
you're getting into the development

1050
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,980
phase of the weapons and altering the

1051
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,420
software the code in some way that

1052
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,920
sabotages them when they're ultimately

1053
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,960
launched we don't have a lot of details

1054
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,280
on that though just that initial

1055
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,200
reporting and I want to sort of want to

1056
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,020
end on this because Ukraine is so

1057
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,240
prominent in the news right now Ukraine

1058
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,280
has been using and receiving a lot of

1059
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,119
weapons from allies a lot of the weapons

1060
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,359
that Ukraine owned are sort of old

1061
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,820
generation weapons that don't have a lot

1062
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,740
of digital controls in the don't have a

1063
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,780
lot of computer controls but they are

1064
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,400
going to be getting Next Generation

1065
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,680
systems from the US and elsewhere with

1066
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,540
the high Mars which do have a lot of

1067
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,180
computer control in them and so in

1068
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,520
essentially providing the ukrainians

1069
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,280
with a lot of uh military capability

1070
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
you're also potentially creating new

1071
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,960
kinds of vulnerabilities I was speaking

1072
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,060
with Dimitri alparovich I don't know if

1073
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,500
you guys know that know him from

1074
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,839
crowdstrike now he's no longer

1075
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,760
crowdstrike but he does Consulting with

1076
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,560
governments and everything and he said

1077
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,720
that he didn't think that the Russians

1078
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,000
had the capability to be sabotaging this

1079
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,260
equipment right away that it would

1080
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,720
probably take them a year or more to

1081
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,520
figure out vulnerabilities and design

1082
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,839
attacks against them and of course

1083
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,339
they're preoccupied with a lot of other

1084
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,200
things at this point but that's assuming

1085
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,760
that they weren't already interested in

1086
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,040
these systems before they were being

1087
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,619
given to Ukraine so it's unclear at this

1088
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:46,619
point what kinds of attacks can be

1089
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,420
targeted against these kinds of systems

1090
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,980
it's unclear what the vulnerabilities

1091
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,839
are again there's not a lot of research

1092
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,460
going on in this area not a lot of

1093
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,680
transparency but I'll just leave you

1094
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,370
with that so thank you for your time

1095
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:05,270
