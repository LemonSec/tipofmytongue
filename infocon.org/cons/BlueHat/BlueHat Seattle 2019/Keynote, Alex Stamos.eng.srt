please welcome to the stage our keynote

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,080
so thanks for coming out today thanks to

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,000
Microsoft for inviting me back to blue

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,790
hat I actually got to be at the first

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,210
blue hat which was much smaller Zahn the

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:34,269
Microsoft campus and an included a

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,370
number of bizarre moments including me

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,680
getting stuck on that floating bridge

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,930
with a bunch of Microsoft executives and

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,030
security researchers in a limo full of

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,739
hard alcohol we won't be talking about

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,650
what ended up happening while we were

17
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:49,140
stuck for six hours because it rains in

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,680
Seattle and nobody expected that

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,350
apparently when designing your

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,370
transportation infrastructure instead of

21
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,079
talking about that what we're gonna talk

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,329
a little bit about is no talk about

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,390
where we go in in security and some of

24
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:04,420
the basic issues we have as an industry

25
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,700
of applying our efforts to actually keep

26
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,979
people safe and the things we need to be

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,350
thinking about if if we want to focus

28
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:13,780
ourselves on the real problems that are

29
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,550
facing people and we got to talk about

30
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,500
this because it just turns out that as

31
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,220
an industry we're not we're not doing so

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,200
hot right and by we I mean like a pretty

33
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,550
large set of people of the tech

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,210
companies themselves the engineers that

35
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,039
work there

36
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,259
the people kind of the academic CS space

37
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,840
and and the nerd culture in general

38
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:34,360
we are not we have been incredibly

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,850
effective in inserting technology into

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,110
every aspect of people's lives of making

41
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,390
them completely dependent on the

42
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,740
technology and then effectively leaving

43
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,380
them on their own to deal with the

44
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,979
aftermath and that has not gone

45
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,869
unnoticed you might recognize a fun

46
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:52,270
little show called Silicon Valley beam

47
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,280
in Seattle you guys get to keep pretty

48
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,699
much out of the jokes that are made

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,470
about the valley I guess if it was set

50
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,250
here there'd be more Patagonia puffy

51
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,500
jackets and such but I do think this is

52
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,780
applicable the folks who work appear in

53
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,690
tech and you know they've got this this

54
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,550
famous opening right where that includes

55
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,530
a bunch of logos from different

56
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,690
companies kind of rising and falling and

57
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,010
stuff and you know people say that

58
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,060
there's this old Chinese proverb I don't

59
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,859
know if that's even true I think it's a

60
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,830
proper cool of like may you live in

61
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,650
interesting times the thing I tell other

62
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,480
CEOs when I run into them is may you

63
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,849
have a long enough careers at sea so

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,140
that one of them were difficult

65
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:35,909
moments of your professional career

66
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:39,638
becomes a visual gag on an FBI HBO show

67
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:41,888
that that that can be kind of your

68
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,930
legacy that that that's what put on your

69
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:45,400
tombstone in your obituary

70
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,829
is something that people were joking

71
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,200
about on HBO but like I think while

72
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,659
Silicon Valley's kind of a funny show

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,010
and pokes fun with love it does

74
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:57,159
demonstrate that there's an incredibly

75
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,560
deep distrust of tech and incredibly

76
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,200
deep distrust of the things of those who

77
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,760
are building tech and it I think it's

78
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,138
partially because we have some real

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,328
fundamental problems in tech in general

80
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,609
but also specifically in information

81
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:11,620
security and one of those fundamental

82
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:13,359
problems that we still have in security

83
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,939
is that those of us in security are

84
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:18,760
super in love with complexity we are

85
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:21,939
fascinated by the really interesting

86
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,739
problems and the incredibly complex Rube

87
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:27,459
Goldberg solutions that we could put in

88
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:29,230
place to fix those problems so I'm kind

89
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,449
of a fake professor now and I've been

90
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,709
told to be a real academic you have to

91
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:35,049
have something named after yourself

92
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,060
right and you also have to write a book

93
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:39,280
and assign it to your students that they

94
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,949
have to pay $75 for it to get the credit

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,120
so I'm starting with step one which is

96
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:45,370
trying to name something and there's

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,889
something I actually started using as a

98
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,870
tool in 2017 when I gave a talk at

99
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,900
blackhat but I've been refining it and

100
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,000
trying to keep up to date and I I need

101
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,799
your help to make this stick the star

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,540
most hierarchy of actual bad stuff that

103
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,739
happens in real people so it kind of

104
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,019
rolls off the tongue it's a real simple

105
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,419
thing I want you to drop it in any

106
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,459
conversation that you're having but what

107
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,489
I think we need to start to do is we got

108
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,709
to start to aim against complexity and

109
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,689
the really sexy working we have to start

110
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,690
thinking about every day when we go to

111
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:18,190
work for the hour of you know for those

112
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,589
hours of time that we're spending in the

113
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,750
office probably in a horrible crappy

114
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,940
open plan office where everybody has to

115
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,800
have noise cancelling headphones and

116
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,960
we're spending it doing that instead of

117
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,500
walking through the forest or spending

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,780
time with our children or meditating

119
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,789
that for every hour we are sitting in

120
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,340
front of a screen doing this work that

121
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:42,130
we should get the most ROI out of the

122
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,229
time that we are giving to reduce the

123
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,380
harm to other people right that is what

124
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,659
we

125
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,880
should optimize for it turns out if I

126
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,720
kind of look backwards in my career I've

127
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,190
probably miss spent most of it and not

128
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,480
being focused on things that cause the

129
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,980
actual amounts of harm and this became

130
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,080
really clear to me over the last couple

131
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,130
of years when I was in the CSO role for

132
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,780
companies that served hundreds of

133
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,490
millions to billions of people is it

134
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,380
turns out the vast majority of bad

135
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,270
things that happen to people online have

136
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,190
nothing to do with traditional

137
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,830
information security they are what we

138
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,660
classify abuse and abuse is the

139
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,320
technically correct use of the products

140
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,940
we build to cause harm so this is all of

141
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,460
hate speech and harassment and

142
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,980
disinformation this is the sexual abuse

143
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,859
of children this is the spreading of

144
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:30,160
lies to abuse people this is a type of

145
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,050
abuse called sextortion the extortion to

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,930
try to get nude photos from both adults

147
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,670
and kids there's a whole host of really

148
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,500
horrible things that happened with the

149
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,510
technologies we build every single day

150
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,920
that have no interesting technical

151
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,630
component right this should be

152
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,820
technically correct use of these

153
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,770
products but with the goal of harming

154
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,840
people and the vast majority of bad

155
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,460
stuff of the bad things that happened to

156
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,659
people today because of the things we

157
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:57,460
build the majority of that will be abuse

158
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,960
and this is for a number of reasons but

159
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,700
partially because all of these problems

160
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,489
have existed in society for a long

161
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,920
period of time yet the the internet

162
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,410
especially can make them easier to do

163
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,990
easier to amplify it could give people

164
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,420
at least the feeling if not the the

165
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,490
actual pseudo anonymity they need to

166
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,130
pull it off without getting arrested and

167
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,680
so none of these things are new but

168
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,990
they've all been adapted and made much a

169
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,660
much bigger problem due to this work and

170
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,530
then we have kind of at the top

171
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,290
traditional info sex the stuff that

172
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,460
we've all been doing of the trying to

173
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,410
prevent people from technically

174
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,870
manipulating systems to violate privacy

175
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,700
confidentiality and the integrity of

176
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,180
data the availability of systems right

177
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:42,550
now if you zoom into the InfoSec pyramid

178
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,160
right let's oh let's zoom into this and

179
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,960
make it the whole thing you'll find that

180
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,880
even if you reduce yourself to only

181
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,219
caring about information security which

182
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,300
despite the last slide InfoSec is still

183
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,560
really important right it's really

184
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,000
important for us to build secure systems

185
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,919
but if you think about the things that

186
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,889
actually harm people every day what

187
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,628
you'll figure out is that

188
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:02,360
the basic things that cause the most

189
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:04,219
harm are the most prosaic the number one

190
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,080
source of people's information being

191
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:08,719
stolen online the absolute number one

192
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,520
with a bullet nothing even close is the

193
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:13,009
reuse of passwords across the internet

194
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,948
the number one risk to customers of

195
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,810
Microsoft especially office 365 is not

196
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,639
the Ministry of State Security of the

197
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,979
People's Republic of China coming after

198
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,469
you guys with a brand-new kernel exploit

199
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:28,008
that nobody's ever seen before it's the

200
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:30,860
fact that every real estate agent and

201
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:33,169
title company in the United States uses

202
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,419
an office 365 account has not turned on

203
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,400
two-factor and every day millions of

204
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,080
dollars are stolen from innocent people

205
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,359
of their down payments on their houses

206
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,729
because their title company didn't use

207
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,099
two-factor and their their wire transfer

208
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,960
was was redirected to a bank first in

209
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,878
Cyprus and then moved to somewhere in

210
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,840
Eastern Europe that is probably the

211
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,819
worst thing that will happen on

212
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,960
Microsoft's products today from a the

213
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,060
number of people who are being hurt

214
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,000
right um and it's because it's a simple

215
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,219
attack it requires exploiting people who

216
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,419
are not that technically sophisticated

217
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:07,339
it has a history in like a very basic

218
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:09,049
part of the American economy where we do

219
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:10,639
really silly things like send people's

220
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,039
life savings and wire transfers that

221
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,199
aren't authenticated and so there's a

222
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,659
bunch of different factors but the core

223
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,879
problem is just the account lifecycle

224
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:21,139
problem in the password problem when we

225
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,060
start to talk about actually exploiting

226
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:26,000
systems the vast majority those problems

227
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,159
are patching right everybody knows what

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,419
what's your guys's favorite a mess

229
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,240
number from the last couple of years

230
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:35,659
what's your favorite Eric does it

231
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,820
perhaps end with a 10 yes right so the

232
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,110
most important exploit against Microsoft

233
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,880
systems for the last couple of years has

234
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,420
been the eternal blue exploit right this

235
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,660
beautiful highly stable exploit with

236
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,339
fantastic anti exploit mitigations and

237
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,870
offsets beautiful paid for by the

238
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,880
American taxpayer so we should all pat

239
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,320
ourselves on the back for paying all

240
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,850
this money for this gorgeous exploit

241
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,160
that was then leaked by the shadow

242
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,170
brokers but for the vast majority of

243
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,939
damage caused by the eternal blue

244
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,490
exploit especially in the form of wanna

245
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,899
cry not petia all of that damage would

246
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,760
have been preventable if people had

247
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,230
patched their systems for the vast

248
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,110
majority of time the eternal blue is

249
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,180
being used outside of the NSA

250
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,340
patches were available right it's the

251
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,569
fact that patching is really hard that

252
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,040
you end up with the National Health

253
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,870
Service is the United Kingdom going down

254
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,730
that you end up with the Maersk shipping

255
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,470
line go almost going out of business

256
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,030
only in being saved by the fact that

257
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,920
there is a power outage and one of their

258
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,420
African ports and so they still had a

259
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,260
domain controller that they could

260
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,449
recover patching is the source of the

261
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,880
vast majority of actual exploits that we

262
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,850
deal with simple configures of people

263
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,290
configuring their systems in basic ways

264
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,610
standard old web app phones we see this

265
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,579
all the time

266
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,310
seem like the the Equifax hack was a

267
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,290
standard off-the-shelf issue and then at

268
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,020
the top you basically have all of new

269
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,069
security research right so this is like

270
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,199
everything that people are writing

271
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,390
papers about and talking about at black

272
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,080
hat and DEF CON and RSA and such and

273
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:06,470
then the top pixel of this is owed a

274
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,970
right so all of true owed a fits into

275
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,010
the top pixel of this triangle which

276
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,170
again is a zoom in of the actual trying

277
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,390
triangle of human abuse and all my time

278
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,250
as a sea so I think I only saw and I was

279
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,900
the CEO of companies that play at the

280
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,910
top level that have the best adversaries

281
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,490
I think I only saw true OD deployed

282
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:25,250
twice in that period of time even the

283
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:29,660
most advanced attackers the MSS is the

284
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,520
PLA S the SV ARS these organizations

285
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,420
will use off-the-shelf exploits and

286
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,180
off-the-shelf tools

287
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,500
99 times out of 100 if they can get away

288
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,239
with it they don't want to burn the road

289
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,920
a they don't want to do anything that's

290
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,020
more complicated or harder they have to

291
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,079
do now if you have Superman vision and

292
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,550
you're able to zoom in to the screen you

293
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,920
would see that every pixel on the screen

294
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:52,400
is actually comprised of sub pixels

295
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,319
right of red green blue sub pixels this

296
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,470
sub pixel represents all of the human

297
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,120
harm ever caused by side-channel attacks

298
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:04,700
in the history of information security

299
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,490
this is what we dominates discussion in

300
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,670
the security research community is super

301
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,430
complicated esoteric issues that for

302
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,729
which there's almost no demonstration

303
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,439
ever or even good theoretical purposes

304
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,570
in which this would be the best way for

305
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,430
somebody to to to leak out information

306
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,620
or somehow otherwise compromise the

307
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,319
system right and so this is the

308
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,300
fundamental

309
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,610
is that if you actually look at what

310
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,410
people are working on that pyramid is

311
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,740
inverted people are spending way more

312
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,810
than a sub-pixel thinking about super

313
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,579
esoteric side-channel attacks in Intel

314
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,689
processors for examples right that

315
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,219
doesn't mean we shouldn't research it

316
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,810
doesn't mean we shouldn't fix it but it

317
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,509
shouldn't be the thing that we think way

318
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:48,000
more about I want to read way more about

319
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:49,920
how people are making it easier for real

320
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,350
enterprises to patch their systems I

321
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,939
want to read way more about how people

322
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,829
are designing their systems to not be

323
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,690
able to be easily abused to cause harm

324
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:59,699
and a variety of really horrible ways

325
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,250
then I read about more side-channel

326
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:04,589
attacks I certainly don't want people

327
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,360
coming up with with dam names and

328
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,980
domains just for their side channel

329
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,529
attack that drives me totally insane

330
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,389
right and the fact that we reward that

331
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:15,630
behavior over and over again as an

332
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:17,399
industry only makes things worse another

333
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,310
fundamental issue that we're all dealing

334
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,430
with the tech is we're lacking a real

335
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,199
good role model for the relationship

336
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,149
between these incredibly powerful tech

337
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:30,689
companies individuals in the government

338
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:32,220
now the who is responsible for keeping

339
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,360
people safe and who's responsible for

340
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,209
making decisions on behalf of other

341
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,649
people is the history of all of politics

342
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:39,869
right this is what every war has been

343
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,399
fought about this is what every kind of

344
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,290
philosophical political philosophical

345
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,449
discussions about is who's in charge and

346
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:48,389
how do you make decisions and so we have

347
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:50,189
a long history of arguing over these

348
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:51,870
things in a number of ways of dealing

349
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,149
with those arguments either in a violent

350
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,920
or a non-violent manner but what has

351
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,740
happened the last couple of years is

352
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,079
we've seen a whole new revolution in

353
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,579
information that has overturned hundreds

354
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,888
and hundreds of years of these

355
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,750
philosophical arguments so we for most

356
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,889
of the history of the human race which

357
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,300
is something like five hundred thousand

358
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,880
to a million years depending on when you

359
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,500
cut off Homo sapiens my brother is

360
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,730
actually a real anthropologist and so

361
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,189
it's an interesting discussion of like

362
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,750
how old is humanity turns into a 90

363
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:19,740
minute lecture so I'm like okay I'm

364
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:24,149
gonna say five hundred thousand years

365
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:26,339
thinks so for most of the history of the

366
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,660
human race the only people that you

367
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,579
could communicate with are people who

368
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,050
could physically hear your voice right

369
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,449
so the number of people you could speak

370
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,979
to or the people could hear you and then

371
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:37,109
we had the invention of writing in the

372
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,460
written world word which was limited to

373
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,920
a very small number of wood

374
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,300
people and for the most part from much

375
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,550
of history especially in the Western

376
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,290
world that written word was controlled

377
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,540
by a small number of organizations who

378
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,910
had people who could go copy the words

379
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,410
over and over again um in particular the

380
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,760
Christian Church which eventually became

381
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,610
the Catholic and Orthodox churches

382
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,650
controlled the history of the Western

383
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,540
world because they decided what is and

384
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,490
is not valuable enough for people to sit

385
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,949
there and manually copy then we have the

386
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,600
invention of movable type and it's being

387
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,570
brought to the west and movable type

388
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,430
made it so at least rich people could

389
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,820
speak to hundreds or thousands of people

390
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,060
and the result of the printing press was

391
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,440
hundreds of years of war in Europe

392
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,449
hundreds of years appeal people killing

393
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,370
one another because of the ability for

394
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,110
people to spread those ideas but we kind

395
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,310
of figured out how to stop killing each

396
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,650
other because of that and then we had

397
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,000
radio and television and radio and

398
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,740
television were once again actually

399
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,630
really unifying now you can speak to

400
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,640
millions of people with the radio but it

401
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,340
cost a lot of money to do so and because

402
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,319
of things like spectrum you know

403
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,760
spectrum being required you had lots of

404
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,530
legal regulations so for most of the

405
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,840
20th century we have a huge

406
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,790
consolidation of speech and the internet

407
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,140
has massively blown that apart and as

408
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,390
create situation where for the first

409
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,000
time ever a normal person without a lot

410
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,850
of money without a corporation can speak

411
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,080
to millions of people but can do so in a

412
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,020
way where those gatekeepers that

413
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,210
naturally existed in the print world and

414
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,340
in the in the radio and television world

415
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,080
no longer exists and that is what our

416
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,760
society is really fundamentally dealing

417
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,890
with and so hundreds of years of

418
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,840
arguments that like for example arguing

419
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,790
about the First Amendment a lot of those

420
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,290
arguments are based upon the idea of the

421
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,360
printed word being what they're arguing

422
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,280
about right and these are not new

423
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,890
problems the United States was partially

424
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,660
founded by people who used anonymous

425
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:28,080
political speech to start a revolution

426
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,060
right and so anonymous political speech

427
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,430
causing trouble not exactly a new thing

428
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,479
but certainly is a different thing when

429
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,250
it's something that's available in the

430
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,540
hands of everybody and so all of these

431
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,000
decisions that we've argue about for

432
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,740
hundreds of years have been reopened and

433
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,720
we're arguing about them in a way that's

434
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,030
much more quick and without kind of the

435
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,710
framework that we used to rely upon that

436
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,240
we thought was really fundamental here

437
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,740
and part of the problem is that people

438
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,910
don't really know what trade-offs they

439
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,190
want so like the classic optimization

440
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,569
in all of engineering is this one right

441
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,180
at that you can have something built

442
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,910
quickly and you have it done built

443
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,920
correctly or cheaply right pick two of

444
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,449
these three things pick some point in

445
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,280
this triangle to optimize for your

446
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,840
engineering project um I once gave a

447
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,400
talk to a bunch of Air Force generals

448
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,630
and they pointed out if you want to get

449
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,110
none of these things you should use the

450
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:15,550
Pentagon procurement process so it's not

451
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,780
necessary that you're actually in the

452
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:22,229
triangle there are other things outside

453
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,579
of it I guess that our Pentagon shaped

454
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,380
but for most engineering projects this

455
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,060
is what you're choosing right well it

456
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,220
turns out when we talk about the

457
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,650
optimization problems in the modern

458
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,660
world especially around people speech

459
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,120
online this optimization problem is much

460
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,490
more complicated and there's a bunch of

461
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,320
equities that are really valid equities

462
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,020
that we could that all of us could agree

463
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,270
are good equities that you can't get all

464
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,189
at the same time and in fact unlike the

465
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,860
triangle the relationship between these

466
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,900
equities is much more complicated it's

467
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,940
much harder to predict that when you

468
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,220
move towards one of these equities which

469
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,230
ones do you move away from sometimes in

470
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,120
a nonlinear manner so some great

471
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,130
examples of this would be the idea of

472
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,859
data Portability and competition versus

473
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,859
data protection GDP are the big European

474
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,899
law both requires tech companies to

475
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,939
allow people's data be portable but then

476
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,800
also gives them the responsibility to

477
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,810
keep that data from going somewhere else

478
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,609
and so there's a fundamental tension of

479
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,050
if you allow people to take all of their

480
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,179
data especially on the communications

481
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,430
platform they will also be in taking

482
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,560
other people's data right if I export my

483
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:29,650
Gmail inbox I'm exporting the

484
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,750
communications and then the metadata

485
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,970
about thousands of people with whom I've

486
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,400
communicated is that my right to have

487
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,020
portability does that override the right

488
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,340
of those people to control whether or

489
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,910
not I take their data to another

490
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,189
platform

491
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,600
um the gdpr turns out not to actually

492
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,430
deal with that problem they just kind of

493
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,290
punted it on to the tech companies and

494
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,300
so you end up with those kinds of

495
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,850
problems where politicians want both

496
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,220
things kind of like a child and don't

497
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,540
make a decision of how do they want to

498
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,750
have a balancing act between these

499
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,940
equities another really big one is the

500
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:04,930
power of corporations to control speech

501
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,910
the the most common complaint that kind

502
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,460
of I heard at Facebook

503
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:10,290
was Facebook is way too powerful and I

504
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,680
want that power used to squash my

505
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,389
enemies right that that was like that's

506
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,560
the summary of a bunch of things that

507
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,180
you saw this a lot with Mark Zuckerberg

508
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,620
on the hill yesterday that was

509
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,210
effectively what a number of members of

510
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,919
Congress within their five minutes would

511
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,810
both be like you're way too powerful and

512
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,310
I want that power used directly

513
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,440
compatible with my personal political

514
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:30,120
preferences right and it turns out that

515
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,310
that's not how it works right that you

516
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,719
have to decide who do we want making

517
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,370
these decisions and what power do we

518
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,020
want them to have and then you have to

519
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,850
kind of put up with the fact that if you

520
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,900
give that power to somebody they will

521
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,209
make decisions that you personally

522
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,530
disagree with and this was kind of the

523
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,240
idea of a lot of the constitutional

524
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,399
structure of the United States was the

525
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,990
idea of well maybe there are things that

526
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,460
we're just going to allow because we

527
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,160
don't want people making those decisions

528
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,510
because we don't want humans at least in

529
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,610
the government having that kind of power

530
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,230
but now that these decisions are being

531
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,419
made by private corporations we don't

532
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,550
have a good model to decide what is and

533
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,280
is not allowed and how what kind of

534
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:08,010
process do we have to get to that point

535
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,480
another really fundamental issue that

536
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,480
the tech companies have done a really

537
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,950
poor job with is that we are not

538
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,040
proactively honest about the downsides

539
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:19,290
of what we build so in all of tech you

540
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,720
know kind of the standard you know

541
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,870
aesthetic is everything is wonderful

542
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,960
right like if you watch a Apple Keynote

543
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,070
Apple has taken this feeling of

544
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,570
technology's a wonderful thing they make

545
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,639
people's lives better and they have

546
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:36,270
distilled it down to the pure

547
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,220
crystalline cocaine essence of of this

548
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,020
idea that they are the absolute best

549
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,420
starting with Steve Jobs but that says

550
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,980
continued to be the absolute best of

551
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,180
putting out the idea that the things

552
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,560
they build are wonderful and beautiful

553
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,090
and perfect and make people's lives

554
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,520
better and there's no possible downside

555
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,379
to anything right and the rest of us

556
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,510
have copied that aesthetic have copied

557
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,220
the idea that we only talked about the

558
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,840
positive things that we only talked

559
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,670
about the ways that our products make

560
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,500
people's lives better that we try to

561
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,750
avoid whenever possible talking about

562
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,420
downsides and the truth is is when you

563
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,490
build products for humans products that

564
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,410
are going to fit into human society you

565
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,360
have to deal with the fact that human

566
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,110
society is flawed and that humans are

567
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,389
flawed sometimes to an incredible extent

568
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,709
and one of the places in which we have

569
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,720
the best statistics on this

570
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:26,669
is on the sexual abuse of children and

571
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,470
that's because this area of abuse has a

572
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:30,690
particular structure in which that there

573
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,039
is a nonprofit organization that has

574
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,409
been chartered by the United States

575
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:36,510
Congress to be able to hold on to

576
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:38,730
examples of child abuse and to

577
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:41,100
coordinate between a bunch of companies

578
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:45,480
in law enforcement and to publish

579
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,860
statistics and in 2018 this organization

580
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,909
the National Center of missing Exploited

581
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,189
Children received 18 million reports

582
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:55,140
from tech companies of child abuse in

583
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,270
the United States alone so that's 18

584
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,669
million reports on the basis of 330

585
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,860
million people write the numbers

586
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:03,299
globally are much larger but we don't

587
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,219
really have them because most countries

588
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:08,970
don't have the same kind of organization

589
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,590
so this is the basic reality that we are

590
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,090
building our technologies in is a

591
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,340
reality where this organization exists

592
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,149
this organization is actually quite old

593
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,559
this is for those of you old enough

594
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,360
these are people who have like kind of

595
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,299
milk carts and kids right so Nick Mike

596
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,279
was really built for organizing the

597
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,330
search for missing children I'm doing

598
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,909
things like putting kids pictures on

599
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,889
milk cartons and on posters and on

600
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:30,690
informing law enforcement to be on the

601
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,730
lookout but they have transitioned to

602
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,320
being really focused about the online

603
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,360
because that's where the the abuse is

604
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,610
transitioned and Nick make is part of a

605
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,779
whole set of organizations that have

606
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,639
been talking about these problems for a

607
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:42,960
long period of time and a lot of that

608
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,789
discussion is shifted to the digital

609
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
world kind of the centerpiece of a lot

610
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:47,190
of discussion and I states is this

611
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,559
conference called the crimes against

612
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,059
children conference which is one of the

613
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,190
most horrible things I've ever been at

614
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,830
my life it's a set of wonderful people

615
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,820
who are working really hard on something

616
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,379
that is incredibly terrible it's

617
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,110
actually the only keynote I've ever

618
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,760
cried in which a number of my co-workers

619
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,959
like Alex that's great that you're so in

620
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,399
touch with your emotions I was like I'm

621
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,559
not trying to be in touch my emotions

622
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:09,719
I'm just crying right like it's an

623
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,080
incredibly hard thing to go to and this

624
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,840
is their real schedule and this is a a

625
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,658
conference where the session on

626
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,428
pediatric strangulation a

627
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,929
multidisciplinary response is so popular

628
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,659
that they have to do it twice because

629
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:27,409
the room fills up right and so this is

630
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:30,779
the reality that we are living in as

631
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:33,510
technologists but we don't recognize

632
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:35,010
that right we don't engage with the

633
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,830
fact that this is the reality of

634
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,760
humanity and that by definition these

635
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,800
things will be reflected in our

636
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,190
platforms and so because we don't talk

637
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,870
about these problems we don't set up the

638
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,790
stage for an honest conversation with

639
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,739
people about what we should do in

640
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,300
response and so that balancing act I

641
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:55,500
talked about of picking all these

642
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:57,389
equities on that big whatever star that

643
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,980
conversation is really distorted if by

644
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:01,080
the fact that we're we don't talk about

645
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,080
the fact that we live in a world with

646
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,429
lots of adversarial groups from both the

647
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,750
security and the abuse perspective who

648
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:09,420
are very good at what they do and that

649
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,770
we in tech are not perfect and that we

650
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,100
will build products that will reflect

651
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,280
that

652
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,090
and that trying to fix it is a ongoing

653
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,290
thing and there are people who are

654
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,720
definitely engaged all those companies

655
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:21,060
the bottom left are companies that get

656
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,380
together at a side conference during the

657
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,510
crimes against children to talk about

658
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,520
child safety and so there's definitely

659
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,350
engagement on it but you'll never ever

660
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,760
hear them talk about it which is

661
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,219
becoming a real problem and in fact in

662
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,900
the last couple of weeks somebody leaked

663
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,930
the fact that out of the 18 million

664
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,760
reports to Nick Nick about 14 million of

665
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,860
them came from Facebook alone which

666
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,900
because Facebook doesn't talk about this

667
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,510
was then interpreted by the press to say

668
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,130
Facebook's the worst company now it

669
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,450
actually turns out the opposite that the

670
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,970
company that reports the most is the

671
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,110
company that's doing the most right so a

672
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,460
certain competitor of yours that make

673
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,080
cell phones only made a hundred and

674
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,690
fifty reports and so if you're looking

675
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,040
at a company that sells devices for

676
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,150
billions of people and only a hundred

677
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,220
and fifty of them have ever done

678
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:05,130
anything abusive to children they're not

679
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,020
that nice people right yeah that's just

680
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,480
statistically that just means that

681
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,010
they're not looking right and so but

682
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,420
this is a problem of Facebook's making

683
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,490
because Facebook has not spent the time

684
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,110
to say we have this huge team we're

685
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,240
doing all this ml we're doing all this

686
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,189
work we're coordinating with Microsoft

687
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,050
with photo DNA we're building our own

688
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,060
algorithms that discussion has never

689
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:27,120
happened and so when some one statistic

690
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,280
leaks out into the press it becomes this

691
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,389
whole brouhaha where then people come

692
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,889
out of it and we heard this from number

693
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,750
of members of Congress yesterday of like

694
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,210
why is Facebook so bad on child safety

695
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,220
and Zuckerberg had to like the time you

696
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,800
want to explain this is not on c-span

697
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,290
right trust me as somebody who's been on

698
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,610
c-span like that's supposed to be the

699
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,280
performative part it's not such to the

700
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,540
actual educational component I mean

701
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,460
the fact that the companies have missed

702
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:53,310
the opportunity to educate in a much

703
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,610
more calm and realistic setting is a

704
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:59,010
real problem and then another

705
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,959
fundamental issue on the kind of both

706
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:03,480
the abuse in the InfoSec side is we're

707
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,580
not learning from our mistakes right

708
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,380
that as an industry bad things happen

709
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,730
and then we don't fix the fundamental

710
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,890
problems that led to it

711
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:14,160
anybody in here speak Russian any

712
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:16,470
Russian speakers a couple sir do you

713
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,450
mind reading that for us out loud so

714
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,610
people can I can't say it with a correct

715
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,520
accent it's a Federal Security Service

716
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,500
how do you say it in Russian by the way

717
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,510
that's beautiful thank you yes the

718
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,920
Federal Security Service also known as

719
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,740
the FSB so the Federal Security Service

720
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,450
the FSB is one of the two descendant

721
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,330
organizations out of the KGB the other

722
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,380
one being the SVR the third organization

723
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,260
you've heard a lot about is the GRU

724
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,400
which is the military intelligence main

725
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,220
intelligence Directorate that's a

726
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,050
completely separate organization the FSB

727
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,560
is really focused on domestic security

728
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:51,810
as well as spying on people within with

729
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,629
the what Russia considers its near

730
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:57,139
abroad which are mostly ex-soviet States

731
00:25:53,630 --> 00:26:01,680
Kazakhstan Belarus Ukraine and the like

732
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:04,620
from the FSB once caught a young Latvian

733
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,630
man named Alexei and Alexei was doing

734
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,239
some hacking and he wasn't supposed to

735
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,340
be doing that and the FSB colonel

736
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,910
according to what I've been told by some

737
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,320
FBI agents gave Alexei a choice Alexei

738
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,480
could either spend the rest of his life

739
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,669
in a dank dark cell in the basement of a

740
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,670
horrible building or he could work for

741
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,680
them and so Alexei chose option B right

742
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:28,320
that he decided that he was going to do

743
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,900
work on behalf of the FSB and so Alexei

744
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,250
has a whole set of hackers that work for

745
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,500
him who are globally distributed a

746
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,670
number of them are in Russia but they

747
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,630
actually turned out to be all over the

748
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:42,210
world and they both do hacking on their

749
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,280
behalf but then every once in a while do

750
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:46,830
hacking on behalf of the Russian

751
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,379
government and my path crosses with

752
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,870
Alexie's in that he was the guy who led

753
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,970
the team who broke into Yahoo a couple

754
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,620
of months after I took over SC so later

755
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,660
and I spent most of my time at Yahoo

756
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,908
trying to get Alexei and his friends out

757
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,799
of our network and so we that

758
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:04,059
a big fight for us there were a lot of

759
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,830
problems at Yahoo that made it really

760
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:08,529
difficult for us to go up against a

761
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,509
professional team like this um and it

762
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:11,499
ended up real poorly for the company and

763
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:14,109
we'll talk about some of the fundamental

764
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:15,129
issues there but like lots of companies

765
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:17,439
you know we had a fight

766
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:21,399
we eventually prevailed and then what

767
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,259
comes after the beating of the actual

768
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:25,209
intruders is the company takes on

769
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:28,599
another fight and that fight is against

770
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:30,099
class-action lawyers and so I don't have

771
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:31,720
to explain to you guys who this man is I

772
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:34,059
sometimes do have to explain to

773
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,190
undergrads amazingly enough it's like

774
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:40,989
he's not just the malaria guy I used to

775
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:42,879
view computer stuff but you guys know

776
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:47,739
what this this these videos is from

777
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:51,090
right anyway I throw it out yeah this is

778
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:53,679
for his deposition so a deposition is

779
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:56,499
when you when you give testimony for a

780
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,629
trial but not in court right this is how

781
00:27:56,499 --> 00:28:00,460
a lot of civil cases while the movies

782
00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:00,879
like to show that everybody's always in

783
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,379
court

784
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,959
that's not how civil cases work in civil

785
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:06,699
cases what happens is the witness shows

786
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,369
up in a conference room in a law and the

787
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,509
law firm and a bunch of lawyers ask

788
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:11,918
questions and there's a bunch of lawyers

789
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:13,599
from that person side and from the

790
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,710
company and they videotape it and

791
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,668
there's a little stenographer sitting

792
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:21,609
there and typing right and so I had to

793
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:24,009
go do this multiple times I think four

794
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:26,139
times for free Yahoo right because

795
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:27,940
whenever you have a security breach you

796
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:29,379
end up with these lawyers some of them

797
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,509
actually have automated systems that

798
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:33,369
will file lawsuits as quickly as

799
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:35,470
possible so that they can be first in

800
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:36,609
line to get class action and so you have

801
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:38,049
a state class action you have a federal

802
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:39,580
class action you have a class action on

803
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,249
behalf of shareholders on behalf of

804
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,570
users and there's this big huge argument

805
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:45,309
about who gets to be the lawyers in

806
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,349
charge and they all work it out through

807
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,700
some really arcane rules but then

808
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:51,070
eventually there's actually some

809
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,210
subsequent lawsuits and so I had to

810
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,340
spend a bunch of time gained question

811
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,659
and that's fine like I took the CSO job

812
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,488
at Yahoo knowing it was gonna be a hard

813
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:59,019
job knowing that I was taking on a huge

814
00:28:57,489 --> 00:29:00,309
amount of responsibility and that I was

815
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:01,869
gonna be responsible for my actions and

816
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:04,570
so the fact that I spent something like

817
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:06,158
30 or so hours being questioned about

818
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,349
all the things that led into the breach

819
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,609
was fine with me and then they talked to

820
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:11,349
dozens of other people they talked to

821
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:12,879
the CEO they talked to a bunch of people

822
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,029
from technology a bunch people on my on

823
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:16,129
my team they

824
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:18,229
selected tens of thousands of emails and

825
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:20,689
documents they did thousands and

826
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:23,119
thousands of hours of investigation into

827
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:24,649
what went wrong at Yahoo thousands and

828
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,238
thousands of hours and what do you guys

829
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:28,279
think the output of that was of the

830
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:30,739
thousands and thousands of hours of work

831
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:32,599
of all of these executives in question

832
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:35,779
of the creation of thousands of pages of

833
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,460
testimony the output of all of this was

834
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:39,649
a couple of lawyers from Florida got

835
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,649
thirty five million dollars right this

836
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:44,418
is what our society did with the the

837
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:46,428
retroactive look at what happened at

838
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:48,710
Yahoo is we decided to give the people

839
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:50,179
who were the fastest and the best at

840
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,070
fighting that they get to represent the

841
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:53,539
class action thirty five million dollars

842
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,549
and then another fifty million dollars

843
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:58,759
being spread around all the users right

844
00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:01,129
and then all of that documentation got

845
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,779
buried right in fact I'm not even

846
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:04,279
allowed while I have copies of a bunch

847
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:05,659
of documents there under a protective

848
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:08,210
order and so the way this works is

849
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:11,299
because of the settlement the company

850
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,710
gets to lock up whatever Yahoo is now it

851
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:15,769
turns out the question of who is Yahoo

852
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:17,059
now after their acquisition it turns out

853
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:18,799
to be this interesting question but like

854
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:20,928
whatever corporate entity represents

855
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,549
whose interest was able to lock up all

856
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:23,690
of these documents and stuff so that

857
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:25,279
none of the people who were involved

858
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,690
could talk about it right they paid

859
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,879
eighty five million bucks and then all

860
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,589
of that work goes away and this is why

861
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:32,539
we keep on making the same mistakes over

862
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:35,629
and over again is that every time

863
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:37,820
there's a problem we don't talk about it

864
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:39,139
publicly we just bury it and maybe

865
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,119
there's a lawsuit and maybe some people

866
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:43,099
make some money but certainly people

867
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,359
don't come out and proactively say this

868
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,979
is how we screwed up and this is how you

869
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,649
should fix it this is the same problem

870
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:50,539
at three major companies right github

871
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:52,820
one of your guys's companies Twitter and

872
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:54,589
Facebook and these this problem with

873
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,700
unencrypted passwords didn't exist

874
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:57,769
because these companies don't know your

875
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,359
sister encrypt passwords the problem was

876
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:05,899
is that well what do you guys think what

877
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:08,330
was the root cause here what did the

878
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:10,178
developer do what did like one developer

879
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,769
probably do that caused these problems

880
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:14,809
they turned on parameter logging on post

881
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:16,460
requests right yes

882
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:18,349
in all of these cases some developer

883
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,029
turned on parameter logging they logged

884
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:21,408
it probably to some huge internal data

885
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:22,970
warehouse where nobody knows what's in

886
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:24,830
it and they left that data warehouse

887
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,269
going and so just like if you left a

888
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,830
hose going long enough in your lawn

889
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:29,030
you'll end up flooding the lawn

890
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,340
they ended up flooding their company

891
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:33,350
with unencrypted passwords right but

892
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,510
none of these companies came out and did

893
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,610
a deep retrospective because there is no

894
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,750
motivation for them to do so because if

895
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,490
they came out and said this is how we

896
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,260
screwed up they get made fun in the

897
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,330
press they get sued all these bad things

898
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,350
happen this is different than other

899
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,030
industries and probably the industry

900
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,219
that has the best example of doing

901
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,720
really technically hard things and doing

902
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,810
so safely all the time is the aviation

903
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,580
industry right if the VA if the aviation

904
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:58,129
industry was as bad as we are

905
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,020
we'd all be dead right like there's just

906
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,220
there's no way the odds of me surviving

907
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,410
might flight up here to Seattle last

908
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,570
night would have been really poor

909
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:07,580
if the aviation industry did safety like

910
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:09,409
we do safety in the technology industry

911
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,760
and there's some reasons for this

912
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,860
there's obviously cultural reasons or

913
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,750
structural reasons but also there are a

914
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,550
bunch of structures around when bad

915
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,920
things happen people learn from them so

916
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:21,050
if there's a major incident where like

917
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,850
people die or there's a whole loss or in

918
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,940
injuries then there's a real

919
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:28,219
investigation run by the government that

920
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,600
everybody participates in right and

921
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,790
that's the National Transportation

922
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,530
Safety Board and they have professional

923
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,060
investigators who understand aviation

924
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:37,100
who go to wherever the bad thing

925
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,530
happened interview all the people

926
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,330
involved deeply dive into the forensic

927
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,550
evidence and then something around a

928
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,110
year or so afterwards publish a huge

929
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,340
document of this or all the things that

930
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,260
went wrong and they don't just say like

931
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,300
this fan blade cracked

932
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,160
they say the fan blade cracked which is

933
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,810
because of this manufacturing defect and

934
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,800
that was related and it wasn't caught

935
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,629
because of this and wasn't caught

936
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,100
because of that and this is the the

937
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,810
reason why the FAA didn't have good

938
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,610
enough oversight and so they come up

939
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:04,220
with all of the root causes that got you

940
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,679
there we don't do this in cyber right

941
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,810
there's nobody to Equifax breach

942
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,670
nobody's going and diving into what

943
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,620
happened we're never going to see a

944
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,150
200-page report of these are the

945
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,760
fundamental problems instead of Equifax

946
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,590
that you can learn from and because NTSB

947
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,720
does this the rest of the industry

948
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,149
learns that every time something bad

949
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,430
happens it hopefully only happens once

950
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,840
or twice before everybody else learns

951
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,460
from it and then they make a different

952
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,139
mistake whereas in tech we just make the

953
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:32,450
same mistakes over and over again for

954
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,890
different companies there's also a part

955
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,290
of this that's really interesting which

956
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:39,920
is there's a whole system that is built

957
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:41,629
to encourage people to report near

958
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,050
misses right so the ASRs

959
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:47,090
system is a system that's run by NASA

960
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,050
and if you're involved in the aviation

961
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,360
industry

962
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,310
you get legal protection that if you say

963
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,929
man I really screwed up something bad

964
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,840
happened you can give that information

965
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:58,790
to ASRs and that can't be used to pull

966
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,889
your license or to see you or to do

967
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:02,960
anything like that and so if you're a

968
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,570
nervous flier I do not recommend looking

969
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,070
at this database because it is the

970
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,230
database of every possible thing that

971
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,779
might have happened that almost killed

972
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:15,590
people but like in this example here's a

973
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:18,970
real example of a plane getting you know

974
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:21,590
almost crashing on landing at SFO

975
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:23,480
because of an autopilot error that

976
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,010
turned into a human error and but they

977
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,040
figured it out and they fixed it before

978
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,200
they landed and so when this pilot went

979
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,090
through this problem there their

980
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:36,020
reaction was probably to go back to the

981
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:37,639
hotel have a scotch and then to sit down

982
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,100
and to write all the recollections down

983
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,840
and to submit it and now other people

984
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,159
can go look at all of these

985
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,179
recollections of all these people have

986
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,620
went through it and they can come up

987
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:48,020
with lessons for all of us we don't have

988
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,429
anything like that in InfoSec and as you

989
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,530
guys know there's a lot of near misses

990
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:53,510
right for every breach you hear about

991
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:55,639
there's a dozen situations where

992
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,710
somebody tried and the defenders got

993
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,140
lucky right that maybe they broke into

994
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:01,580
the wrong system or you your detection

995
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,290
systems ended up catching them right at

996
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,299
the last second there's a dozen of those

997
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,460
near misses and we don't learn about any

998
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,010
of those because they all get covered up

999
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,530
immediately so what are the lessons

1000
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,120
actually from Yahoo versus the FSB so

1001
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:16,490
three ones that that hopefully are

1002
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,740
helpful to you first is if you're not

1003
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:21,049
moving forward you're drowning so one of

1004
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,729
the poor problems at Yahoo was yahoo had

1005
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,860
to invent web-scale

1006
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,660
architectures in the late 90s right so

1007
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,370
like before Yahoo did it nobody really

1008
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,540
handled a million concurrent users on

1009
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,120
the webpage that was crazy

1010
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,009
and so this core technical team invented

1011
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,529
all the stuff that we see a standard now

1012
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,240
of like no sequel databases distributed

1013
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:41,480
databases

1014
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:44,540
you know equivalents of memcache a bunch

1015
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,980
of different systems to manage hundreds

1016
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,290
of thousands of UNIX systems at the same

1017
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,900
time which was totally ridiculous in the

1018
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:52,190
late 90s they built all that stuff but

1019
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,100
the problem is is it stayed all that

1020
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,710
stuff so the rest of the world moved

1021
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,569
and then Yahoo stayed the same and so as

1022
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,400
a result by the time I got there Yahoo

1023
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,710
was hiring all these young engineers to

1024
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,970
effectively reverse-engineer the stuff

1025
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,030
that was built by people that now had

1026
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:09,069
great ponytails to figure out like oh my

1027
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:11,260
god how does this database of user data

1028
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:13,750
work like and they basically have to

1029
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,760
pray to the system that had been built

1030
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,410
up like the layers of troye of code

1031
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,140
built on the burned layers that came

1032
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,118
before it that nobody knew how it worked

1033
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,759
it'll turned out Alexei and his friends

1034
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,080
figured out how it worked and so you

1035
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,820
know but if you're not moving forward if

1036
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,529
you're not reinventing yourself you end

1037
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,740
up getting stuck and that becomes a real

1038
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:34,180
problem in technology that if you you

1039
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,799
can't build something just leave it

1040
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,359
there for ten years and think it's still

1041
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,890
gonna be secure the world moves on so

1042
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,440
you have to the basic systems have to

1043
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,990
move on as well the second is that tech

1044
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,550
companies can be too responsive to Wall

1045
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,890
Street and so one of the core problems

1046
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:50,650
at Yahoo was it was extremely responsive

1047
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,118
to investor pressure when I started

1048
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,710
there there's a lot of focus on security

1049
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,840
and then we ended up picking up a

1050
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,640
activist investor it turns out this

1051
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,400
activist investor their big claim to

1052
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,450
fame was they took over the Olive Garden

1053
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,810
so it's like oh well that makes them

1054
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:06,430
totally able to help run a company that

1055
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:08,380
serves like 500 million people's email

1056
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:10,149
right because they figured out the

1057
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,260
breadstick problem at the Olive Garden

1058
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:16,540
and so as a result because of this

1059
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,250
activist investor there was a huge focus

1060
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,960
to make money in the short term and for

1061
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,390
user growth in the short term because

1062
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,220
the company just cared about the numbers

1063
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,170
for the quarter because one or two bad

1064
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,310
quarters meant the entire management

1065
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,500
team in the board was going to be

1066
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,210
replaced and so because yahoo was so

1067
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,550
responsive to Wall Street and cared so

1068
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,410
much about short-term profits that ended

1069
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,810
up pulling away resources from the

1070
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,850
really important things in fact I think

1071
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:42,160
the way we compensate people in tech is

1072
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:44,650
really wrong from my perspective we

1073
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,899
should no longer give rsu's to public

1074
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:49,030
tech company employees like if you're at

1075
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,680
a private company it's great for you to

1076
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,480
have stock so you're aligned with the

1077
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,118
founders and the investors but at a

1078
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,510
Facebook or Google or Microsoft you know

1079
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,640
stock is just cash and it's cash that is

1080
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,109
priced by Wall Street and so you have

1081
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,730
the situation where CEOs can say

1082
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:05,319
something like we're gonna do the right

1083
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,510
thing we're gonna focus on safety and

1084
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,030
Trust

1085
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:11,550
and by the way 80% of your compensation

1086
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,900
executives is based upon whether Wall

1087
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,580
Street likes our quarterly numbers but

1088
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,890
don't listen to them who are paying for

1089
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,779
your house listen to me the CEO who's

1090
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,430
just saying something right and so

1091
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,780
that's what we find ourself in is this

1092
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,819
huge mismatch between what our

1093
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,680
executives say and how we're compensated

1094
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,850
and we really should not care about what

1095
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,230
hedge funds think about what we're doing

1096
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,210
we should feel good about what we're

1097
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,040
doing ourselves it's what what I think

1098
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:35,520
and then the third kind of personal

1099
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,740
lesson is if you're ever having IV in

1100
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,500
your arm you should turn your phone off

1101
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:41,669
and so in the deposition one things they

1102
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,190
do is they have all these emails and

1103
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,869
they make you read the emails and so I'm

1104
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,790
at this big table and there's like three

1105
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:49,200
or four lawyers on this the plaintiff

1106
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,300
side and there's like seven or eight

1107
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,529
lawyers two of them are mine a bunch of

1108
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,270
them are Yahoo a bunch of them are other

1109
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,560
companies that might be Yahoo again it's

1110
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,119
really complicated like who's Yahoo in

1111
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,130
the situation but there's like a zillion

1112
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,810
lawyers there's a video camera there's a

1113
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,580
stenographer everybody in the room is

1114
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,470
getting paid to be there but me right

1115
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,390
and they're all watching every single

1116
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,160
thing I say and they push across this

1117
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,250
binder and they say mister samos can you

1118
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,549
please turn to tab 53 and I turn to tab

1119
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,810
53 and oh my gosh and like oh mr. Thomas

1120
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,000
can you read do you know what this email

1121
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:20,970
is oh this looks like an email I sent to

1122
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,800
my boss on this date Yatim mr. Thomas

1123
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:25,259
could you read this email please but

1124
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,300
really do i yes yes you need you need to

1125
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:32,310
read it please

1126
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:33,600
okay dear Jay why the eff am i no no mr.

1127
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:37,410
Thomas you need to say the whole words

1128
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:40,740
you can't say why the mmm F and MF and

1129
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,149
so I read this email of why the eff and

1130
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,319
I'm saying the F for you but I'm now

1131
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,550
saying it for real in front of the

1132
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,619
stenographer who has to record

1133
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:50,010
everything why the eff am I getting this

1134
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:51,869
email from these MF Fame consultants who

1135
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,609
want to effing lay off my people in the

1136
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:55,320
middle of an effing breach

1137
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:57,240
i'ma can I can I stop no you need to

1138
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,790
read the whole email and so I read this

1139
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,220
whole email that's like this and it's

1140
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,750
because while we're dealing with the

1141
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,450
Russian breach at Yahoo I actually

1142
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:08,040
messed up my knee it was my third knee

1143
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,569
surgery my first two were because of

1144
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,460
like soccer injuries in high school

1145
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,750
which turns out that like the high

1146
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,760
school girls are like oh man you're a

1147
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,900
hero it turns out when you break your

1148
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,589
knee putting up Christmas decorations

1149
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,989
your wife does not treat you like that

1150
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:24,049
anymore your wife's response is a little

1151
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:27,170
more muted and so thanks to Christmas

1152
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:28,309
decorations I was on crutches and I

1153
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,839
wouldn't do the surgery because we're in

1154
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:31,489
the middle of incident response and I

1155
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,900
need to be running the team and my

1156
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:34,309
doctor is like okay well if you don't

1157
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,529
fix it you're just gonna limp forever

1158
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:39,140
but go ahead and do your whatever hacky

1159
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:40,339
thing that you're doing and so we're

1160
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,589
doing it we're doing it we're doing it

1161
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:44,180
and then finally we have a good weekend

1162
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:46,578
we think the bad guys are out of the

1163
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,989
network and so I scheduled a surgery and

1164
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:51,469
so I'm sitting there in the surgery

1165
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:53,599
center with an IV in and I check my my

1166
00:40:51,469 --> 00:40:55,039
phone and I have an email from my boss

1167
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,440
saying that these consultants from the

1168
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,119
outside in response to all these Wall

1169
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,529
Street demands had come up with the list

1170
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,049
of my employees we're gonna be laid off

1171
00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:05,150
and it's like the the embers are still

1172
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:06,349
smoldering from our breach and these are

1173
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,910
the people who are putting out the

1174
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:10,519
embers and they wanted to lay them off

1175
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:13,368
and so my response was very candid I

1176
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,930
guess you would say and so my advice to

1177
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:15,829
you personally is if you find yourself

1178
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,169
in that situation

1179
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:21,440
turn off the phone put it down and

1180
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:23,299
respond after surgery because somebody

1181
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,210
might make you read that email out loud

1182
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:28,729
on videotape and in front of a judge if

1183
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:31,670
they read the transcript anyway just a

1184
00:41:28,729 --> 00:41:32,989
little tip uh and then we have another

1185
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,539
fundamental thing that we continue to do

1186
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:36,589
at Tech which is we when we scale the

1187
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:38,719
culture of our companies we end up

1188
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:40,969
worshipping the past there's a great

1189
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,200
blog called strata quarry this guy Ben

1190
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:44,359
Thompson wrote this really good piece

1191
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,069
about the importance of culture and

1192
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:49,130
companies and we says is that culture

1193
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:50,630
exists because in a company when you

1194
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,999
show up to work and that horrible Open

1195
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,859
Office plan like you don't go and talk

1196
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:56,868
to the CEO and say hey CEO what am i

1197
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:58,400
doing today right the corporate culture

1198
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:00,499
is what informs you to make all of those

1199
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,119
little decisions consistent with what

1200
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:03,859
the corporation might want and so

1201
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,239
culture is super important and it's

1202
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:07,249
super important and companies are really

1203
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:09,380
successful but the problem is is that

1204
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:11,089
companies will get successful and then

1205
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,339
people will look back at that culture

1206
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:15,049
and they'll be like oh all of the

1207
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:17,328
aspects of our culture five years ago

1208
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:19,729
were critical to our success and that's

1209
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:22,130
not true some of them are critical some

1210
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:24,288
of them are no longer reasonable based

1211
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,489
upon what's happened in the world and

1212
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:27,829
this was a core problem at Facebook is

1213
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:29,420
that cultural touchstones that were

1214
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:31,910
super important for the growth of the

1215
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:34,190
company we're totally fine

1216
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:38,078
the company was effectively a life

1217
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:40,819
support system for farmville right but

1218
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,220
when the company became the most

1219
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:45,109
important news distribution platform in

1220
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,058
the planet then those cultural touch

1221
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:49,009
tones no longer worked and this is just

1222
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:50,420
like especially for those use at

1223
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,700
startups you have to be really careful

1224
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,859
about making sure as the company grows

1225
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,629
that you don't venerate the past too

1226
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:58,038
much and that you don't let people who

1227
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,260
are part of the decisions that were made

1228
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:01,760
that were important who are often now

1229
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,579
really rich and really powerful

1230
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,049
you can't overemphasize their opinion

1231
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:07,520
versus the people who come in because

1232
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:09,680
that's a core problem you see a lot of

1233
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,569
companies and Google's probably a great

1234
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,129
example of that Google is one of the

1235
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:15,200
most influential companies on Silicon

1236
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:18,319
Valley and tech culture overall and they

1237
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,509
gave us this idea of basically the diva

1238
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,038
that has to be protected like the ten

1239
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,349
times engineer that whatever they do

1240
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:25,819
however they treat their co-workers you

1241
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:28,339
protect them that is one of the most

1242
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:30,288
damaging and horrible ideas that have

1243
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:32,240
ever made it out this is exactly the

1244
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:33,740
kind of thing that if somebody is an

1245
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,229
incredible engineer but they're a jerk

1246
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,058
we need to treat them as a jerk right

1247
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,039
and you need to have a corporate culture

1248
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:44,480
where people treat each other well and

1249
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:45,440
so you got to push against this okay so

1250
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,730
I'm ready on time so I'm going to go

1251
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,170
kind of quickly but where are some of

1252
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,369
the things that we can be doing other

1253
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,430
than the things we've been talking about

1254
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:53,990
the first is the key to predicting harm

1255
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,509
against individuals is to have empathy

1256
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:59,990
for your users and the key to empathy is

1257
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:01,039
team diversity so take five seconds and

1258
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,959
look around at the people who are

1259
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:09,920
sitting around you just go ahead I want

1260
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:12,230
to see head swiveling yes so how many

1261
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,809
people named John do you think like

1262
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:19,490
raise your hand if your name is John let

1263
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:22,039
me see all the John's Yeah right

1264
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,808
are there more John's than women in the

1265
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:26,630
room are there more Eric's than women in

1266
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:28,430
the room right this room is not

1267
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,859
reflective of the Americans that use our

1268
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,629
products it is definitely not reflective

1269
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:33,920
of the three to four billion people

1270
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:36,079
around the world who use the products we

1271
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,369
build right and this doesn't mean we're

1272
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,529
bad people for being part of the

1273
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:41,630
industry but we have to build our teams

1274
00:44:39,529 --> 00:44:44,270
to be reflective of those who can be

1275
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,590
harmed by our actions so that we have

1276
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:47,570
the ability to predict the thing

1277
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:50,210
go wrong and to build solutions that

1278
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:52,190
work for them we need to shift risk

1279
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:54,710
ownership in organizations to the people

1280
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,300
who make the real decisions so one of

1281
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,670
the real problems would be in a CSO in

1282
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:01,790
2019 is that you effectively have the

1283
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:04,640
same responsibilities of a post SAR box

1284
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:08,509
chief financial officer without the tool

1285
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:11,900
of accounting right and that a CFO is

1286
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:13,760
not the only person who cares about not

1287
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,860
doing illegal things inside of a company

1288
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,990
you're not allowed to be the SVP of a

1289
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,750
publicly traded company and to say hey

1290
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:22,759
boss a CEO I just made 10 billion

1291
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,560
dollars in profit I want a huge bonus by

1292
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,180
the way it's all Enron accounting but

1293
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,670
will will just fire the CFO and we'll be

1294
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,410
good right that is effectively how we do

1295
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,810
security in most public companies is

1296
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:34,730
that we have the security team be the

1297
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:36,440
owners of the risk and the owners of the

1298
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,870
critical decisions when they what they

1299
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,610
really should be are the consultants the

1300
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,290
people who are helping out the shoulder

1301
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,270
to cry on and the people who measure

1302
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:46,880
risk and take it to the board and so we

1303
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,620
have to push these decisions into the

1304
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,320
people who make the real decisions that

1305
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,150
matter in these companies in the

1306
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,860
security industry we have to adjust our

1307
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,060
incentives towards harm instead of

1308
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,890
complexity so when we want to see

1309
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,210
research we should see research that

1310
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,589
really matters this is one of my

1311
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:03,110
favorite papers from the last couple of

1312
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,460
years the privacy and security threat

1313
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,680
models and mitigation strategies of

1314
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,240
older adults this is effectively this

1315
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,399
paper represents all of your

1316
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,069
Thanksgiving breaks which is spent

1317
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,990
getting the malware off of you know and

1318
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:17,240
the bad chrome plugins off of all of

1319
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:19,100
your dads and uncles and computers right

1320
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,740
and you're like I'm not gonna ask my dad

1321
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,940
where he got this malware oh please god

1322
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,339
I'm not looking at his browser history

1323
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:28,910
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna fix this

1324
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:30,980
computer right this is a study of how

1325
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:33,680
people actually get harmed and

1326
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:35,690
especially older folks and I think that

1327
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,029
kind of work is we should see I want to

1328
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:39,700
see 20 of these for every side channel

1329
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:43,840
attack that gets its own domain okay

1330
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,839
that's what we have to do is in industry

1331
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,049
we've got to teach these lessons in the

1332
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:51,270
classroom so this is some really

1333
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:54,480
interesting research about a dating app

1334
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:57,240
that is aimed at the LGBT Q community

1335
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,740
and it made the same mistake that lots

1336
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,839
of dating apps make which is you're

1337
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,950
trying to provide somebody a distance to

1338
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,840
somebody else that they're looking at

1339
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:06,060
but you don't want them let them figure

1340
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,220
out exactly where that person is so the

1341
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,170
easiest way to do this is to grab the

1342
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,450
find GPS data send it up to the cloud

1343
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,240
and then add random numbers what's the

1344
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:17,339
problem with just adding random numbers

1345
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,470
they average out right and so if you

1346
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,180
grab over and over again you can just

1347
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,980
average it all out and then you recreate

1348
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,049
the person's find GPS data in this case

1349
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,460
this could have caused real harm to be

1350
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,010
based upon who this was target this

1351
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,870
product was targeted at and everybody's

1352
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:33,000
made this mistake tinder grinder a

1353
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:35,100
gazillion apps have made this mistake

1354
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,600
and fixed it but we'd never teach those

1355
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,310
things back in school and so you can

1356
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,240
graduate from almost any University and

1357
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,250
not know anything about this problem

1358
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,049
we're working on this at Stanford so

1359
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,610
this is a class that we're putting

1360
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,510
together that I'm teaching ten students

1361
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,790
right now and we're hoping about a

1362
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:49,590
hundred students in the next quarter

1363
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:51,750
about the real things that happened

1364
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,710
online and then our goal is to get lots

1365
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,530
of people to teach it so we're gonna

1366
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:57,690
open-source it so anyway my overall

1367
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,550
message is we won right like we're the

1368
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:02,430
cool kids now the Nerds inherited the

1369
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:05,250

00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,930
told people they need to pay attention

1373
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,270
to us they need to care about the things

1374
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:17,370
we're doing we have to actually live up

1375
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:19,410
to when we say we're gonna change the

1376
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:20,900
world we have to believe that we change

1377
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,859
the world and we have to act accordingly
