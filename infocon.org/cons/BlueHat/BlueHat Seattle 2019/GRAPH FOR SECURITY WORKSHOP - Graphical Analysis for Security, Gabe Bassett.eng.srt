1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,329
hello everybody my name is Walter Doric

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,119
I'm a program manager in cloud a cloud

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,540
and a night security and I have the

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,650
honor of introducing our next speaker so

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,570
before we get into that I just wanted to

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,830
remind everybody this is all public

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,369
information you can feel free to share

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,369
this online use the hashtag blue hat and

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,759
all the speaker's handles on Twitter

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,380
will be on the agenda that you have so

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,779
without further ado we like to introduce

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,390
Gabe Bassett is a senior information

13
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:45,590
security data Sciences at a Verizon

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:45,590
security research okay let's see

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:56,300
it works okay let's see are we up and

16
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:59,030
going we good yeah we're good

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,500
okay so I'm Gabriel Bassett and this

18
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,109
presentation is going to be

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,229
why not graphs or also why not graphs

20
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:07,759
we're we're gonna cover both of those

21
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,429
before we get into it this is the

22
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,009
disclaimer this is my opinion and so I

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,850
do a lot of data-driven security talks

24
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:18,470
and this is going to be about kind of my

25
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,750
opinionated view and experience with

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,520
graphs it's not academic fact in any way

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,020
and that doesn't mean that my opinions

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,830
are wrong or bad just that the only

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,750
evidence is my experience now things I'm

30
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,119
not going to talk about or all this

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,979
stuff these are all important things

32
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,280
when it comes to graphs you know nodes

33
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:39,170
and edges the types of graphs things

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,670
like that but they're also things you'll

35
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,990
be able to go back and look at and maybe

36
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,420
some of the other speakers will cover

37
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,190
them this is going to be primarily about

38
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,830
kind of the process I went through with

39
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:53,960
grass and so you know starting out with

40
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:56,210
who I am I am NOT going to introduce or

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,219
to show you a tool like Collin is I am

42
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,350
NOT going to do this incredible awesome

43
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:02,979
presentation that just flows with a

44
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:07,399
wonderful accent the way John Hawes is

45
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:09,829
I'm just another data scientist doing

46
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:13,340
stuff but I've been doing stuff with

47
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:16,670
graphs for a long time I started back in

48
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,989
2011 and a room that was kind of like

49
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,119
this it's one of these government rooms

50
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,980
right that doesn't have any windows this

51
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,299
one was underground it was like had room

52
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,750
for like a hundred 20 people and there's

53
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:29,090
like 10 people in it and I had a problem

54
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,519
because I was getting all this cool

55
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,250
information right this cool intelligence

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,700
about who is attacking what we're in

57
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,500
like all these super awesome details and

58
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,268
the problem was I couldn't do anything

59
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,549
with it like there's no way to take that

60
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:45,680
information and make it actionable to

61
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:46,970
the broader audience and this was really

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,579
frustrating me because I want to make

63
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,930
all this information very actionable and

64
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:53,569
be able to make use of it

65
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,700
and so one day it's like the end of the

66
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,069
day I'm walking past that one of my

67
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,238
friend's cubicles and he knew the

68
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,060
problem was having he goes hey you know

69
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,840
my company had this project that we did

70
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,340
a year or two ago and it used these

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,390
things called grass and his company

72
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,580
because he was a contractor he's like

73
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,380
you know we didn't I don't really know a

74
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,000
lot about them and the project didn't

75
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,350
really go anywhere but you know it kind

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,290
of seems like something that might fit

77
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,280
what you were doing and so I didn't know

78
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,750
anything about graphs in the

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,380
mathematical sense at the time and

80
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,300
really neither did he and so we did what

81
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,420
any good researcher would do and I

82
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,040
wouldn't looked him up on Wikipedia and

83
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,929
you know that's a good starting place

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,950
and the more I learned about him the

85
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,470
more I realized that there was something

86
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:40,609
I really liked it made a lot of sense to

87
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,450
me and so now in the government for

88
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,709
those who have worked in the government

89
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,470
you realize you don't just get to go

90
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,390
install software but we do get as you

91
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,540
get Microsoft Office and so I went and

92
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:53,119
implemented Bayesian network inference

93
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,429
in Visual Basic in the back of an Excel

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,900
spreadsheet we put the notes and edges

95
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,420
in here and now you can put in like the

96
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,530
place and like an indicator and a person

97
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,329
and you could have them linked up but

98
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,130
you could you know do inference through

99
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,739
it and I was super proud of this I

100
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,840
wasn't a programmer at all at the time I

101
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:10,790
showed it to my boss and she said

102
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,459
Gabriel you know that we don't make

103
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:18,108
tools this is not the high point of my

104
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:20,510
career but I kept going I left did a

105
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:24,289
little work invented new stuff got

106
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:28,840
another job but the graph stuff stuck

107
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,840
with me and so

108
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:36,639
the next part is to figure out when they

109
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:40,059
use grass and when not to because a lot

110
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,219
of times graphs either make sense to

111
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:43,809
people or they don't and this is kind of

112
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:46,089
an example from grapple which we'll talk

113
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:49,869
about later in the day I think after

114
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:51,939
lunch you could think about data in kind

115
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:53,919
of two forms it can be a graph or it

116
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:55,839
could be tabular and people kind of lean

117
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,849
one way or the other and one thing I

118
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,019
found over time is that a lot of people

119
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,759
the graph is just never going to make a

120
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:03,999
lot of sense to them working with it

121
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,469
directly but on the other hand there's a

122
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:07,869
lot of people that once you learn about

123
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:09,759
graphs it's just like it's mind-blowing

124
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:11,739
like it's like this is this explains

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,439
everything right the whole world it's

126
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:17,888
all graphs and certainly is for me like

127
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:22,499
I understand things that way but that's

128
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:24,669
kind of a problem because the reality is

129
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:26,079
while everything can kind of be

130
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:28,029
explained that way it's not always a

131
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,179
good idea and so I saw this kind of

132
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:33,579
marketing side and a blog a couple days

133
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:35,558
ago and I kind of liked it because right

134
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:37,839
you know databases oh there's no use

135
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:39,099
graphs they do everything and the only

136
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,989
thing I can say is if you think there's

137
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:44,889
no trade-offs in using graphs that means

138
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:48,039
you just haven't used grass there's a

139
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,689
lot of trade-offs to using graphs and so

140
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,269
you need to understand where to apply

141
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:54,699
them and where not to apply them now the

142
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:56,889
things that really affect where to apply

143
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,779
graphs and we're not - are kind of one

144
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,579
how is your data structured into how are

145
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:03,308
you going to be carrying it and so if

146
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,869
your data is a lot of try polls so a is

147
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:06,849
related to B we just heard in the last

148
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:09,459
presentation about relationships a is

149
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:10,869
related to B and you've got a lot of

150
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,999
different A's and you got a little

151
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:15,219
different B's and they're spread out and

152
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:17,829
not occur a whole lot you know maybe it

153
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:20,709
makes sense to structure your data as a

154
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:22,329
graph and so in my original problem I

155
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,749
had all these disparate things like

156
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:27,969
location data data about an individual

157
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:29,860
technical data and it was all very

158
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:32,739
disparate and so it made sense the

159
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,599
structure it as a graph in my current

160
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:37,539
job we structure a lot of our breach

161
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,669
data as kind of hierarchical JSON and

162
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:42,248
any indigent individual record may have

163
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:44,859
only a subset of the relationships and

164
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:46,659
so we're still currently able

165
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,879
to flatten it out due to a couple

166
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:50,560
peculiarities about it but it may make

167
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,530
sense to go and change it to a graph in

168
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,520
the future on the other hand if your

169
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,099
queries are very graph structured it

170
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,710
makes sense and so like whoever who here

171
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:05,229
has heard the term think like a vertex

172
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,330
anyone yeah it's from the original prego

173
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:09,039
paper from Google and what it means is

174
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,500
that your algorithm starts like at a

175
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,030
node and it looks at its neighbors and

176
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,530
it makes a decision and then it moves to

177
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,659
another node it makes a decision there

178
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,059
and you get kind of sequential query

179
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:22,599
through your data and so if your queries

180
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,400
are very much like that like a going on

181
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,219
to be going on to see going on to D a

182
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,409
lot of times that kind of lends itself

183
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:32,139
to a graph based query like in the last

184
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:34,960
talk we weren't necessarily querying

185
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:37,689
graph data but we're using a very graph

186
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,758
structured query to get to the data and

187
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:44,080
that's why you know the graph structure

188
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:47,979
helped in that case now on the other

189
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,839
hand sometimes graphs are not the best

190
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,520
choice this is one of my league wrasse

191
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,020
we'll talk about visualisations later

192
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,210
but this is just demonstrable ugly

193
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,500
so to understand when not to use graphs

194
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,388
you kind of need to go back and think

195
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,669
that even though you may think in terms

196
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:05,949
of graphs your computer doesn't

197
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:08,229
necessarily right your computer's memory

198
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,449
is sequential it doesn't store it in a

199
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:12,008
graph the way your mind does and so

200
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,810
traditionally there's a couple ways to

201
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,120
store it you can store them as linked

202
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,979
lists which are slow to write and you

203
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,539
can store them as matrices which is slow

204
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:22,000
to read they all have their

205
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,949
disadvantages and this isn't to say that

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,110
this is like the state of the art even

207
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:28,960
years ago Georgia Tech had a program

208
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,120
called stinger which did linked lists

209
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,948
but it put like blank pieces of memory

210
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,140
in the list so they could shift data

211
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:36,819
back and forth much more quickly and so

212
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,769
there's probably a bunch of stuff that's

213
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,599
been done to improve this but your data

214
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:43,328
is still being stored sequentially even

215
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,640
if you are interfacing with it and even

216
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:49,329
if your visualization of storage of it

217
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,560
is as a graph and so because of that you

218
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,989
need to think that since it's being

219
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,550
stored linearly anyway maybe it makes

220
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,620
sense for me to store it that way and to

221
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,089
actually work with it that way

222
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,540
because I think that

223
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:03,550
last talk relationships and as you start

224
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,189
to think in terms of graph everything

225
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,569
starts to look like a relationship and

226
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,850
then we go well if it's a relationship

227
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,950
it must be a graph but right in the

228
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,430
database like a row in a database is

229
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,260
called a relationship for a reason and

230
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,030
if your data is tabular in nature

231
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,210
there's no reason that you need to

232
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:24,250
maintain the relationships explicitly

233
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,080
right your relationship may be

234
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,210
maintained by just having a bunch of

235
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,000
sequential blocks of memory so that this

236
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,110
entire column right here is a bunch of

237
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,500
spots in memory and then followed by

238
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,020
this one

239
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,880
come on laser this one and then this one

240
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,439
this one the memory and to get to each

241
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,610
you just take your offset of your row

242
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,860
and then you add the length of the

243
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,900
vector and you can quickly move through

244
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,810
memory in fact something like this

245
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,699
stored in are these strings are pointing

246
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,260
to a global cache and so they don't even

247
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,240
take up a whole lot of additional room

248
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,040
and this is just a boolean one and so

249
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,470
you're not necessarily wasting a lot of

250
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,079
memory and potentially you're gaining a

251
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,060
lot from a structure perspective on the

252
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,010
other hand if your queries are very verb

253
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,510
based and so I used like the deep layer

254
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:10,120
verbs down here but you could also use

255
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:13,330
sequel verts so select where from things

256
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,700
like that if your query fits that

257
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,860
structure it isn't so much vertex based

258
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,320
you may want to be clearing using

259
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,450
tabular data it may make a lot more

260
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,730
sense because it's a lot easier to

261
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,250
structure and to do some of the more

262
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,720
complex questions be very hard to ask

263
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,150
what's the median of each of these

264
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,650
different sets of data if you're doing

265
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,600
it through a database versus doing it

266
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,819
over a vector and over a vector it's

267
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,150
particularly easy in that you can just

268
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:43,060
rip straight through memory and so if

269
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:45,699
you look at like examples of kind of the

270
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,130
differences right a lot of our log based

271
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,290
analysis works well this way and even

272
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,300
though we can do really awesome things

273
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,310
using graphs a lot of times we shouldn't

274
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,560
be necessarily using them graphs if it

275
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:00,270
doesn't make sense on the other hand if

276
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,300
our graph is something like but if our

277
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:06,220
data is very walking through it like who

278
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,599
here is like looked at OpenDNS umbrella

279
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,540
right they store kind of these tuples of

280
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,180
you know a domain is related to an IP

281
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,279
and n IP to an SN and I ascend back up

282
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,939
the chain to Whois data to people and

283
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,130
then back and forth and you can flow

284
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,930
reputation through that graph and that's

285
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,939
just kind of an example that is used in

286
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,099
many other places and so that does fit

287
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,130
very well with kind of the graph based

288
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,560
query and ultimately the thing to

289
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:39,420
remember is that there really isn't any

290
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,518
graph right in the graph API example in

291
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,709
the last talk right we're using graph

292
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,569
type queries to query not necessarily

293
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:46,829
graph structured data and that's okay

294
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:48,449
because at the end of the day we're just

295
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:51,388
looking for relationships and it's all

296
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,449
about you know what structure gets us

297
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:57,540
the most efficient and easiest

298
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:59,339
connection with our data and before I

299
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,519
move on to the visualization stuff I

300
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,560
want to just quickly hit on properties

301
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,610
because as soon as you build a graph the

302
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,469
next thing you want to do is you want to

303
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,850
add properties to your nose because you

304
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,339
realize you left something out and it

305
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,290
doesn't figure scheme anymore and this

306
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,360
works in a lot of cases but there's a

307
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:18,449
lot of cases where it doesn't work for

308
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,000
example if you start realizing that

309
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:23,819
you're it's ok if it's like a column in

310
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,170
your tabular data like you put something

311
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:27,120
on there that you're just going to pull

312
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,439
back in as you do your queries but if

313
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,899
your queries are consuming your

314
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,510
properties a lot of times that's more

315
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:37,139
like adding a table to a database or

316
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:39,180
adding a dimension to a tensor in then

317
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,490
that's gonna slow down your entire graph

318
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,569
quite because you're not really

319
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,569
transversing the graph structure anymore

320
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:47,250
your transversing the data itself and so

321
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:49,529
if you find yourself putting properties

322
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,959
on nodes and then using those properties

323
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:53,130
as part of your query it's a good sign

324
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,609
that you may want to look back at the

325
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:59,040
structure of your data now after you

326
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,839
started using a graph the next thing

327
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,790
you're going to want to do is you're

328
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,709
gonna want to visualize it because we

329
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,740
all love graph visualizations because

330
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:09,180
they look really cool the problem is

331
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,310
sometimes they're good and sometimes

332
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,920
they're bad and so good graph

333
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:16,859
visualizations not necessarily pretty

334
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,209
this isn't pretty but it's good and it

335
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,589
was the quickest example that I found

336
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,250
when I was looking through I like the

337
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:23,530
body of graphs I had

338
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,800
the reason this is good is it's got to

339
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,130
to say 30 40 50 notes like 2 to 3 excuse

340
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,079
me

341
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,050
three to four dozen notes is kind of a

342
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,910
good upper limit for not highly

343
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,709
interconnected data you can see all the

344
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,780
edges you can see the labels on the

345
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,460
notes you know and when you have a graph

346
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,199
like this it has a small number of nodes

347
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,570
you can see the labels and you can read

348
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,980
the edges you can kind of look at the

349
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,800
relationship between these what this is

350
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,260
is the relationship between actions and

351
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,839
attributes in our public various

352
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,330
community database of breaches and so

353
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,520
incident happens an action happens it

354
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,170
compromises an attribute and then that

355
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,810
can lead back to another action and

356
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,579
eventually the incident ends and this is

357
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,079
something like if you're comfortable

358
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,400
with graphs if you think in terms of

359
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,430
graphs like you can look at this and you

360
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,140
can get information from it the next

361
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,670
type of graph visualization that I don't

362
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,120
see a lot of but I really wish I'd see

363
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,860
more of our structural visualizations so

364
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,540
you couldn't read any individual piece

365
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,280
of information off of this you know

366
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,910
that's just obvious from the beginning

367
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,260
but you can read structure does anyone

368
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,160
want to take a guess at what kind of

369
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,160
structure they're seeing here

370
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,740
yeah it's a tree it's a topology this is

371
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:37,769
a network topology from a large company

372
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,870
and what it is is it's the hierarchy of

373
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:42,180
the routers and switches in the IP space

374
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,920
and the cool thing about this is if you

375
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,439
were to take this and you were to take

376
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,479
different organizations and lay their

377
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:50,099
data out in the same way same data same

378
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,870
way you would start to see the

379
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,149
structural differences between the

380
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,500
individual companies by looking at the

381
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:57,149
differences as long as you laid them out

382
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,889
the same way in structure the data the

383
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,290
same way and this is one of those

384
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,360
graphic relations we very rarely see in

385
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,610
practice you know but I think it's very

386
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,160
powerful one looking at the differences

387
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,079
in structure of the graph and then

388
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,779
there's just telling the story or making

389
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,189
a point with the graph this one there's

390
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,470
nothing you're gonna gain from just

391
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:19,110
looking at it it's kind of pretty but it

392
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,639
really makes a specific point and so I

393
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,769
used to work at this organization where

394
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,360
you know the CIO had his All Hands and

395
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:24,839
he was always you know running a little

396
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,240
behind

397
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,069
and so his VP's would be sitting in

398
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,149
there kind of hanging out and I would

399
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:35,610
put these things out and I would take

400
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:37,439
them in to show to the VP's and so I'd

401
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,029
say hey you know what this is this is

402
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:41,160
the connections between everything in

403
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,540
your network you know this is a computer

404
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,029
talking to another computer and you know

405
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,740
what that lime green one right there

406
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,839
that talks to more than anything else in

407
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,459
your network you want to guess what that

408
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,079
is anyone want to take a guess that was

409
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,849
with their guest as well and it's a good

410
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,769
guess except they had 50 domain

411
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,149
controllers and so that load was it

412
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:04,259
turned out spread across a bunch of

413
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:06,930
systems that is the PAC server anyone

414
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,089
know what a PACs are is proxy

415
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,979
auto-config that tells every single one

416
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:13,199
of every computer in your entire network

417
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,120
how to talk to every other computer and

418
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,769
so if you control that you control how

419
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,629
all the computers in the network talk to

420
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,069
each other and that was the most central

421
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:22,319
server because they had one pack file

422
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:24,240
server and it turned out that that

423
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:27,029
server wasn't really high on in one

424
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,279
security list right does it just kind of

425
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,870
set off the side and did his thing you

426
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,389
know that's a profound message that's

427
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:36,449
important in Susan that's a significant

428
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:38,459
thing to know another was this and so we

429
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:42,089
took how the same connectivity graph and

430
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:43,849
we infected one system at tick zero and

431
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,850
then we're showing tick one

432
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,370
and so it tick one every tick we spread

433
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,180
the infection at like a 70% infection

434
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:55,670
rate in tick 1 not a lot gets infected

435
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,439
tick 2 and starting to look like a lot

436
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,550
it takes 3 it's the majority of stuff

437
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,130
and it takes 4 it's like almost

438
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,750
everything right and this was explaining

439
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,830
the story of here's what happens if you

440
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,480
get something that's gonna spread

441
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,970
heavily inside your network here's how

442
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,459
quickly it's going to take over right

443
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,990
and this is again we handed out kind of

444
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,880
as a handout this was a significant

445
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,099
thing it made a big message and

446
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,230
explained the need for segmentation and

447
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:21,589
control over how individual systems

448
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,690
talked internally now on the other hand

449
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,300
there's lots of bad graph visualizations

450
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:28,150
and I'm gonna apologize to Theo upfront

451
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,610
because this is an absolutely beautiful

452
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:34,700
graph it's from a tool called open

453
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,110
graffiti that some folks on the OpenDNS

454
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,560
team mate and it makes these just

455
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,090
beautiful 3d visualisations the problem

456
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,540
is I cannot figure out for the life of

457
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,340
me how to actually use this it's

458
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,680
beautiful but it's not necessarily

459
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,360
actionable and every single person in

460
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,270
this room who's ever done anything with

461
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,879
graph graphs has made a visualization

462
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:58,040
like this something that was beautiful

463
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,200
and like and you want to show it because

464
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,040
it's so awesome but you can't do

465
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,990
anything with it and so as users of

466
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,670
grass we need to be aware that that

467
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:12,230
happens and we need to be prepared to

468
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,400
understand and explain to people like

469
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,630
look we're showing you something cool

470
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,860
but let's get to the actual stuff

471
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,440
because people who are not used to using

472
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,110
graphs look at this and they go ok what

473
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,850
am I going to do with it and they feel

474
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:26,270
like they're failing when they can't

475
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,469
come up with some divine insight from

476
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,800
something like this and then they get

477
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,120
frustrated with graphs and they go on

478
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,280
and then sometimes you get two graphs

479
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,540
that are just so big that you're never

480
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:41,270
going to visualize them well so the see

481
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:45,200
this type of graph like you can use this

482
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:47,180
up to maybe 300,000 nodes or so as long

483
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,670
as they're not highly interconnected but

484
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,380
once you get over that your graphs gonna

485
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,120
start looking like this or if you've got

486
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,770
a highly interconnected graph it's gonna

487
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,149
look like this and it's gonna be ugly

488
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,379
and you can't do anything with it and

489
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,030
there's no point in showing it

490
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,070
this is one of my graphs which is why

491
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,010
there's no citation on it I make ugly

492
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:10,760
graphs too but there's things you can do

493
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:13,309
about it and so first thing you want to

494
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,830
do is filter right this is who here is

495
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:16,789
familiar with bloodhound

496
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,090
yeah good number of people here that's

497
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:22,840
good I was talking to Steven whew who's

498
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:26,330
a visualization expert at a conference

499
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,559
years ago and I asked him you know what

500
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,710
would you do to make graph

501
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,539
visualizations better and because right

502
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,070
with normal visualizations bar charts

503
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,640
and point charts you can do a lot you

504
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,889
can scale axes you can you know improve

505
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,210
how the tick marks are laid out there's

506
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,010
a lot you can visually do to make a

507
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,049
graph better

508
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,940
excuse me make a figure better with a

509
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,620
graph his answer was there's no good

510
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,390
solution you're not gonna do any of

511
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,979
those things to make it look better what

512
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,470
you can do is you can filter and you can

513
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,539
group and so you see that they're

514
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,039
grouping a couple of nodes together here

515
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,669
and then the edge is associated with it

516
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:04,400
in and out or grouped you can filter

517
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:06,320
these are what make a graph look better

518
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,730
if you have a large graph you're and

519
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,500
you're gonna want to read notes from it

520
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,360
you're going to have to get down to

521
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,640
those you know two or three or four

522
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,158
dozen nodes and you need to be able to

523
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,990
group nodes to be able to do that also I

524
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,690
think that interactivity has to be plays

525
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,909
a big part the ability to like mouse

526
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,250
over a node and see information about

527
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:27,919
maybe here's how many nodes are grouped

528
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,289
below it or here is its labels or its

529
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,280
properties things like that

530
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:32,750
interactivity helps a lot and it helps

531
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,320
keep the graph from being uncluttered

532
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,760
also animation can now help a little bit

533
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,168
in fact there's some really cool tools

534
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,929
this thing just came out like a couple

535
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:45,530
weeks ago I think but it's a tool that's

536
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:47,450
all about grouping and graphs and you've

537
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,908
got these really awesome sub graphs

538
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,370
underneath here and labels it's really

539
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:54,789
cool how they are visualizing the

540
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,789
groupings

541
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,360
now the question then is then how do you

542
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,530
determine what to group and sometimes

543
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,959
it's easy because everything has the

544
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:06,300
same property a more generalized

545
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,690
solution I think is entropy and I really

546
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,040
like this is like from 2013 from ATT I

547
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,380
think yeah

548
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,420
these maximal entropy summary trees and

549
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,150
the idea is that you want as you roll up

550
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,790
you say I want to have at most 30 nodes

551
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,500
or something and so what you want is you

552
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,780
want the maximum entropy between nodes

553
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,120
so that you're grouping like things into

554
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,920
each node and I think this is a great

555
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,649
way to do it this works on trees in fact

556
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,240
there's an hour package for it I've

557
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,520
written an algorithm that will do this

558
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,100
in more generalized grass and this

559
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,990
happen back in 2013 so I seriously doubt

560
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm the only one who's ever bothered to

561
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,860
try to do that so I'll bet that now you

562
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,770
could probable implementations to kind

563
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,000
of use entropy to group your graph the

564
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,950
other portions you need to think about

565
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,870
how you're going to lay it out

566
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,670
I literally just took whatever graph I

567
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,280
worked on last and Fe and opened it up

568
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,760
and laid it out a half-dozen ways and

569
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,149
some of these are far better than others

570
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:06,230
right let's see this one the middle one

571
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:08,400
right here I think I dislike the most

572
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:11,070
because you notice there's this very

573
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,210
specific cluster over here of interest I

574
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,639
don't even remember what this graph is

575
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,280
but this is the interesting portion and

576
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,050
in fact up on the upper right one its

577
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,450
off-screen because it got pushed off so

578
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,070
far from a force Atlas perspective you

579
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,520
know a lot of times we default to kind

580
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:28,530
of force based layouts and sometimes

581
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,120
they work and sometimes they don't it's

582
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,220
important to explore the visualizations

583
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,939
you have available and to try out

584
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,410
different ones in fact at the VIS 2019

585
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,860
conference which is I think going on

586
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,860
this week

587
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,520
someone is presenting a generative model

588
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,900
to do graph visualization and so the

589
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,389
model tries to maximize and minimize

590
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:53,059
some specific values and it gives you a

591
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,559
range of visualizations and then you get

592
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,000
to go and kind of sort through and pick

593
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,480
which ones make the most sense for your

594
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,429
data which i think is really cool but

595
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,260
ultimately the way to visualize your

596
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:05,510
data and your graph may not actually be

597
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,350
to visualize your data in your graph a

598
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:12,260
lot of times the right solution is

599
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,418
tabular and now tabular visualization of

600
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,039
the analysis and so we saw that in the

601
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:17,780
last presentation where we were using it

602
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:19,700
we're querying using a graph query to

603
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,379
pull back data but there wasn't a graph

604
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,230
that was demonstrated it was shown in

605
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,610
tabular results which is perfectly fine

606
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,400
in fact this guy kind of had the same

607
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,590
thing you know he loves using bloodhound

608
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,059
but he's using the same craze over and

609
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,559
over again so why even bother working

610
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,030
directly with the graph why not just

611
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,860
dump out the tabular data and work with

612
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:42,230
that which is again pretty easy to work

613
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:43,580
with so moving on from that now we're

614
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,350
gonna walk through some of the examples

615
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,330
that I've done with grass particularly

616
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,789
in things like the DB IR over time and

617
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:52,100
we'll see kind of the evolution of kind

618
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:54,200
of how mentally I've worked with them

619
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,199
and how I've thought about or how

620
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,210
they've changed for me over time and

621
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,309
they started back in 2014

622
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,280
J Jacobs made this visualization put it

623
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:07,250
on the cover this is a graph overlaid

624
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,260
over the PCA layout of the patterns or

625
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,270
the clusters that he did that year in

626
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,700
the same year I joined the team and I

627
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,990
took the DB IR data and I wrote some

628
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,940
heuristics that let me build a graph

629
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,470
from it and again this is the same one

630
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,030
we saw earlier in the pretty graph

631
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,000
except it's got way too many noes to be

632
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:25,970
useful your attack starts at the green

633
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,850
node it goes to a red action and then

634
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,320
that compromises a blue attribute and

635
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,939
then the attack could end but it could

636
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,289
bounce back and forth over and over

637
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,020
again and kind of finally until it comes

638
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:40,039
to this end and this is incredibly

639
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,539
profound right like you can do some

640
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,280
incredible calculations through this you

641
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,710
can go take this graph and figure out

642
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:48,260
what mitigation stops the most paths

643
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,059
between actions and attributes you know

644
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,970
what can I do - what's my single best

645
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,870
mitigation for all the potential attacks

646
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,900
you can ask what's

647
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,668
single best mitigation for the most

648
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,679
likely path through the graph from start

649
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:02,690
to end and how does it change over time

650
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,770
if I mitigate one thing what's the next

651
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,850
thing I mitigate and what's the next

652
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,610
thing I'm it again and we'll see an

653
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:10,340
example of that here in a couple slides

654
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:12,709
you can even go and say okay what is let

655
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,570
me compare two sets of mitigations I'm

656
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,890
going to mitigate this set of notes and

657
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,570
I'm going to mitigate this set of notes

658
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,880
and I'm going to see which one performs

659
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,399
better so if I'm a CEO or someone I can

660
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,289
say you know hey I've got two sets of

661
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,970
mitigations I can implement with the

662
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,470
budget I've got this year which one of

663
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,659
those is likely didn't give me the

664
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,029
better result and I built this into a

665
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:37,399
web app that may still be running I

666
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:39,740
haven't checked it in the year but it

667
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:41,120
provides this really interesting way of

668
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,320
looking at graph the reality is this

669
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,479
graph isn't useful I showed it to my

670
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,500
colleagues and they go it's a dream

671
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,940
catcher yeah even though you can

672
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,470
interact with it you can mouse over the

673
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,580
nose and it'll give you the label it'll

674
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,840
tell you what they're connected to this

675
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,699
really doesn't do anything more than

676
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,010
anchor the concept in people's minds you

677
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,299
can't you can't trace an individual path

678
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,379
through which is what people always want

679
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:05,389
to do with graphs now in 2015 we worked

680
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,980
with the European Union they put us in

681
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,049
touch with the tresspass project and

682
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,399
they put us in touch with the Loess

683
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:12,799
design firm that was working for them

684
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:14,449
from The Hague and their suggestion on

685
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,129
how to visualize grass was this right

686
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,649
and this is better right it's got a

687
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:20,870
smaller number of nodes it's an art plot

688
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:24,350
but still this isn't actionable you

689
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:26,570
can't do anything with this this would

690
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:30,080
this date it would probably be better as

691
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,580
a pair of bar charts because you can

692
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,899
take the nodes you can build bar charts

693
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,580
out I mean you can take the edges and

694
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:36,439
build bar charts and it'd be much more

695
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,789
immediately actionable and useful to

696
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,140
people working on so even though this is

697
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:39,710
interactive again you can mouse over

698
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,270
this stuff

699
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,480
get all sorts of cool stuff from looking

700
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,190
at it and so as we moved on to 2016

701
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,600
instead of showing the graph so much we

702
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,640
showed the analysis we still have that

703
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,168
picture in there but this time we showed

704
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,380
the analysis that we were doing on that

705
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:56,750
kind of the dreamcatcher graph and this

706
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,210
is the kind of figure you got and this

707
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:01,850
is profound like this could still drive

708
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,100
people's security projects and programs

709
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,408
because it turns out that there's really

710
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,280
only two types of attackers there's the

711
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,560
attackers that if

712
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,510
fail they used the same attack on a

713
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,909
different target then there's the

714
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,110
attackers that if they fail they use a

715
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:18,050
different attack on the same target

716
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,300
which is you this is 85% the first one

717
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,919
is 85% the second one is 15% of all

718
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,919
attacks second one of the advanced

719
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,080
attackers and the reality is if you

720
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,390
mitigate that one path that these

721
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,820
attackers are trying for the first type

722
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,770
of attacker they go on and so your first

723
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,270
couple mitigations and these are based

724
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,190
off of incidents and say these things

725
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:40,250
see things like das that don't cause

726
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:42,170
breaches they just come from compromise

727
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,070
availability in here but you get the

728
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,170
same thing if you were dealing with

729
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,000
breaches the first couple mitigations

730
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,920
make a huge impact because you're

731
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,380
effectively eliminating the 85% of

732
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,730
attackers who won't try a second type of

733
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,220
attack against you because they all use

734
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,410
the same type of thing once you get past

735
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:00,590
that the last 15 is incredibly hard to

736
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:03,800
mitigate and the reason is because if

737
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:06,020
you get down into here if you mitigate

738
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,639
step one that they try they don't go on

739
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,310
to the next target they just try the

740
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,510
next dot and so you have to remove all

741
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,940
the things that they could potentially

742
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,890
try to get rid of that attacker and so

743
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,660
it becomes very expensive you don't get

744
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,120
any additional benefit from these until

745
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,280
you've mitigated a lot of them and this

746
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,550
is something that could drive an

747
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:28,220
organization security strategy you know

748
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,440
mitigate to 85% that gets us big return

749
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,820
and stop spinning the same amount on all

750
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,090
these little things that get us almost

751
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:37,220
nothing in return and so we moved on in

752
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,850
2017 and 2017 we didn't do any graph

753
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:44,030
stuff we had other stuff to do but we

754
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,649
came back in 2018 we made put an art

755
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,810
plot on the cover which I thought looked

756
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,910
really cool you still can't calculate

757
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:52,669
anything off of this is just pretty but

758
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:55,100
it's on the cover what we did do in the

759
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,570
back though was much more useful we did

760
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,060
this with graphs tree and I think Leo

761
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,970
will be up here later I'm talking about

762
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,260
some of the stuff he's doing but what we

763
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:07,700
tried to do is we started to get away

764
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:09,080
from showing graphs because we realized

765
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,970
that you can't show graphs to people

766
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,040
because people want to see the pads they

767
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,810
want to say here are the lines that I

768
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,889
follow to understand what's going on in

769
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,929
this and they don't get that from the

770
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,260
graph and so instead we started to go to

771
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:23,169
a much more path based

772
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:26,049
figure and this kind of starts to look

773
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:27,309
like a Wardley map which I'm sure John

774
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:31,629
is likely to mention during his

775
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:33,879
presentation in that you have a x-axis

776
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,350
and you have a y-axis you have points

777
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,270
you can start to figure out that this

778
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,399
goes this way and kind of here's how

779
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:41,799
things pass and the thickness tells you

780
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,510
kind of the direction to go and this is

781
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,179
very useful you can this is actionable

782
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,790
this is a functional visualization of

783
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:50,679
this graph the problem was it was still

784
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,678
very threatening to people people who

785
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,590
are used to seeing bar charts or scatter

786
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,230
plots this is a complex figure to try to

787
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:03,178
consume and people still had trouble

788
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:07,780
reading it and so from there we moved on

789
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:10,840
and in 2019 we went all-in on paths and

790
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,610
so again on the cover and then inside we

791
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,799
used over plotted paths and this is

792
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,350
where I'm focusing a lot of my energy

793
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,150
now and visualization is to try to

794
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,820
figure out how to use over plotted paths

795
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,440
to communicate what's in a graph because

796
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,149
and people still they want to read

797
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,590
individual paths and one though what's

798
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,020
that one path there and it's just

799
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,459
something about the way we think but you

800
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,549
can still get something from the over

801
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,900
plot you can see that you get this kind

802
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:37,540
of overarching narrative like most

803
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:40,450
attacks are short the long ones tend to

804
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:43,210
be more hacking and malware based social

805
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,820
attacks start a lot of breaches both

806
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:49,059
long and short you can gain a lot from

807
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,830
this more so you can plot it over other

808
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:52,870
things and so if you look at breaches in

809
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:55,809
accommodation you can say that they are

810
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,309
much more likely to be Mauer and hacking

811
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,960
and longer than the majority of breaches

812
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:01,600
and that's because accommodations

813
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,970
breaches normally our malware sitting in

814
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,230
RAM and scraping ram for credit cards

815
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,120
and so it takes a much more complex

816
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,770
attack to accomplish you can even look

817
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,389
at the shortest path which is or the

818
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,340
most common path which is always going

819
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,820
to be short because the longer it is the

820
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,720
more likely the diverges at some place

821
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:20,470
and then finally I'm going to end up

822
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,380
with a an on DBR type project that I

823
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,929
worked on and the main reason is to talk

824
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:29,919
about schemas because schemas try to

825
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:32,540
represent the world and you know the

826
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,870
security taxonomy that

827
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,120
John and Dennis did is excellent it's

828
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,860
beautiful but it is complex and as you

829
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,500
try to represent more complex portions

830
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,659
of the world you're going to get much

831
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,190
more complex schemas and it becomes more

832
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,470
complicated use them in your graph

833
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,970
becomes you know overburdened and so I

834
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:52,310
went the other way and said I'm gonna

835
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,960
try to create a simple schema because

836
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,030
obviously simple schemas should be able

837
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,440
to store anything because our brain

838
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,740
store anything and they don't have some

839
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,600
complex scheme in them and really what

840
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,790
we came up with or I came up with was

841
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,439
kind of two different structures and two

842
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,870
different graphs that are related the

843
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,480
first are context graphs context graphs

844
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,580
relate facts right this building is on a

845
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,520
street the street is in a city things

846
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,389
like that in the other portion or action

847
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,320
graphs

848
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:22,970
this action will lead to this effect and

849
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,560
then by pairing those together we could

850
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,210
then try to make decisions through it

851
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,460
about what was happening in the world

852
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:31,340
around us or what was likely was wasn't

853
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,390
and so I built out the graph put a lot

854
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,889
of facts in it and you get this

855
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,330
beautiful kind of structure graph again

856
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,730
you can't calculate anything on this

857
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,919
this is just pretty but it's meant to

858
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,360
make the point that it mimics this graph

859
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,670
tries to mimic the way it brain works

860
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,110
because brains are going to be the most

861
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:49,610
dense the most power efficient

862
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:51,740
calculation systems we have for the size

863
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,629
and so as our graphs try to grow and as

864
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,790
we try to make them more complex looking

865
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,820
at how brains work is a good place to

866
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:00,260
start and by the way I don't have enough

867
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,510
time to do the demo or anything of this

868
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,900
if you want you can see the well you can

869
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:10,640
see the video from 2015 when I demoed

870
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:13,160
this at besides Las Vegas that link or

871
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,320
you can go read the blog post and I

872
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,950
probably should start red wrapping it up

873
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,389
I'm about at time so there's only these

874
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,620
two things ultimately through this whole

875
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:26,300
presentation that I want you to take

876
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:27,979
away the first is how important the

877
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,620
structure of your data in the way you're

878
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,030
going to talk to it are in using your

879
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,469
data and the other is communicating it

880
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,030
because it's going to be those two

881
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,060
things that are going to drive the

882
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:41,210
success or failure of grass within your

883
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,639
project and so with that well before I

884
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,680
open up to questions I know this is like

885
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,410
a super stale meme but and I should use

886
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,100
we brain for it but it's my presentation

887
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,950
I can do what I want

888
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:56,330
so with that questions any questions I

889
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,320
like I know I first she likes ask and

890
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,129
then like give you some time to actually

891
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,570
think about him but I actually may have

892
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:12,140
saved myself just enough time for

893
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:13,549
questions but I really do yes so if I

894
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,739
was starting out

895
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,560
Jeffie is a good one to get started out

896
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:20,899
with because it lets you very easily

897
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,130
visualize your graphs and a lot of times

898
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,750
as you start working with them you need

899
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,460
to see what it looks like and what your

900
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,690
data looks like to kind of anchor it in

901
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,220
your mind and get these one of the best

902
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,850
ways of doing that

903
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:35,899
when I like working with graphs directly

904
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:37,730
I like using Network X when it comes to

905
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,800
even as you get into big in production

906
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,170
graphs there was just to make a point

907
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,590
some guy years ago his graph databases

908
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:47,000
were starting to get big he kind of said

909
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,920
look you know you really don't need the

910
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,620
overhead of it and to prove a point he

911
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,510
took like the largest multi billion node

912
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,929
graph that existed that you could get

913
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,760
your hands on and he wrote a graph tool

914
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,169
and see with a Python interface and

915
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,650
parts the entire thing on a single host

916
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:05,120
and so from a scale perspective even as

917
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,920
you get bigger a lot of times it's

918
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,839
better to work with the graph in memory

919
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,160
on a single host than to try to use the

920
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,660
distributed systems because they have

921
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,330
all sorts of performance issues that

922
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,730
you'll run into and it's very unlikely

923
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:18,470
that your graph is so big that you won't

924
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:22,220
be able to parse it on a single hosting

925
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:24,379
another secret about that is you don't

926
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,819
have to store the data as a graph right

927
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,070
you're just you're trying to keep

928
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,990
relationships so you know you can store

929
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,670
the data tabular Lee build the graph

930
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,709
when you need it in memory do your

931
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:36,200
calculations over it and discard the

932
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,670
graph and I've had someone tell me that

933
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,399
that's what a lot of very very very

934
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,720
large companies actually do ones that

935
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,220
are based around their graph they don't

936
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,750
actually maintain their graph they just

937
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:51,569
build it when they need it analyze it

938
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:56,160
and dump it yeah here yeah Mike here

939
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:58,110
names will in your use of graph in the

940
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,240
DB IR what is the most surprising thing

941
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:08,790
to you that you found out for this year

942
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:13,379
for this here that's a good question

943
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:16,230
I don't know if any of the insights this

944
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,450
year were surprising from a graph

945
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,550
perspective because I've seen it so many

946
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,700
times over I think for others looking at

947
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:26,070
it it would be oh oh there is a good one

948
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,439
so I think the most the biggest surprise

949
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:30,240
is that most attacks are short you know

950
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,400
the paths are almost always short and

951
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,629
very very rarely long but the other

952
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,900
thing I think is really cool is that

953
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:39,540
specific actions start reaches specific

954
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,030
actions continue breaches and specific

955
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,100
actions in breaches and so breaches

956
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,140
almost never start with malware which

957
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,520
makes a lot of sense if you've like

958
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,080
thought about it cuz a matter had to

959
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,370
come from somewhere but like if you

960
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,140
haven't thought about it it's like oh

961
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:55,170
gee if I see malware maybe that means I

962
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:57,600
need to look back in time where it came

963
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:00,450
from on the other hand breaches almost

964
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,190
never end with social attacks and so if

965
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:04,410
you're seeing a social attack it means

966
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,840
there's more coming and so you can use

967
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,129
what you've seen when you start thinking

968
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,080
in terms of paths you can use what

969
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:13,320
you've seen to kind of guess it what you

970
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,850
haven't seen is part of the breach the

971
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:20,470
answer your question

972
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:27,839
any other questions but okay I got one

973
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:27,839
more way back yeah Mike's coming

974
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:38,590
yeah so first of all thank you for the

975
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:40,420
talk on the analytic side well what are

976
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,710
maybe the the starting points you'd

977
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,810
recommend folks for especially for

978
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,010
security applications of areas that

979
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,660
would be most useful to start with

980
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,130
similar to what you said on the tooling

981
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,160
side but more than that algorithm side

982
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,859
so you said on the query side rather

983
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,020
than the out the algorithm side like a

984
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:57,340
drink and some sensuality that kind of

985
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,560
style like what do you find actually

986
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:02,920
useful for security practitioners if

987
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,509
anything so this isn't actually an

988
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,700
interesting question because I think a

989
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:08,920
lot of times like we get into graphs and

990
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,779
then it's like anything else like you

991
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,400
see like you'll initially see these

992
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,109
specific algorithms like breadth

993
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,869
research and depth research and PageRank

994
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:21,220
and centrality and you know all like

995
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:22,900
these kind of common algorithms and you

996
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,189
know you feel like oh I saw those but

997
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,720
that must just be the beginning stuff

998
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,580
you know I need to it's probably much

999
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,509
more complex stuff and I mean there is

1000
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:32,950
complex math you can use against graph

1001
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:37,109
to kind of determine more interesting

1002
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:41,680
stuff but the reality is a lot of times

1003
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:44,080
the simple stuff works you know and so

1004
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,759
running something like PageRank just

1005
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,940
basically does random walks around a

1006
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,490
graph and kind of helps you determine

1007
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,230
what's most important in it centrality

1008
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,669
is kind of a different way a lot of

1009
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,060
times its eigenvector centrality ins

1010
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,020
which is similar to PageRank anyway but

1011
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,340
it's figured out what's the most

1012
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,650
important note of my graph what's

1013
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:05,410
central to it or how do I get from point

1014
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,869
A to point B another one is minimum cut

1015
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:10,299
which says what do I need to remove

1016
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:12,100
what's the minimum at edges our notes I

1017
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,500
need to remove to separate two portions

1018
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,359
of the graph but start with that simple

1019
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,940
stuff whatever tool you're using just

1020
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:20,710
start with the algorithms it has

1021
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,050
involved instead focus on the question

1022
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,520
you want to ask the data not so much am

1023
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,190
i trying to use the most advanced

1024
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:30,280
algorithm so without that probably my

1025
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,730
time thank you

1026
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:36,030
you

1027
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:36,030
[Applause]
