1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,470
so now we're gonna have Joshua kneel dr.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,570
that's the statistician dr. Neal has led

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,369
thank you

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,829
thanks a lot and wow that was a great

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,910
talk from Gabe stole all my thunder so I

16
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,530
think I'm just gonna stand up here and

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:49,890
tell jokes what happened to the Frog who

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,670
parked illegally Anna knows and she's

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,300
somewhere in the back

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,370
he got towed he got towed okay all right

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,690
trying to break the worm the audience up

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,169
a little bit

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,789
yeah I'm Josh I lead the data science

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,159
team for Microsoft defender events

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,860
threat protection the EDR portion of

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,720
that what's EDR so I'm going to talk a

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,270
little bit about our technology because

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,920
that's going to give you some context

29
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,960
for the kind of graphs that we look at

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,960
this isn't a sales pitch I'm just trying

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:24,210
to describe what we do and so it's an

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,579
IDI art technology that means there's an

33
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:31,259
agent running on the endpoint this could

34
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,658
be an endpoint in the cloud a virtual

35
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,590
machine but most of our machines are

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,750
physical if you've got Windows 10 our

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,240
agent is in there it's a matter of

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,630
whether it's turned on or not we also

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,240
have down level versions as well and

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,339
it's an enterprise product and what it

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,119
does is it measures telemetry from the

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:58,560
operating system and since the todger

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:01,469
Indonesia we try to find attackers since

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,490
I run the data science team we try to

45
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,030
find attackers with math and

46
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:11,359
[Music]

47
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:14,980
statistics and like advancing the slide

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,980
deck as well

49
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,798
I've got four buttons if I push off four

50
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:24,049
and none of them work then I have

51
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:27,290
exhausted my Oh what does that button

52
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:35,650
that turns it on that turns it on a

53
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:38,599
fifth button and hello what's going on

54
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,549
maybe it's not talking do I have the I

55
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,798
don't have the dongle that's what's

56
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:45,439
happening so I'm gonna have to flip it

57
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:49,219
from here yeah here's a bit of an

58
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:52,730
outline I tip xscape that so artificial

59
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:55,060
intelligence yeah we do statistics this

60
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,888
isn't meant to insult anybody by the way

61
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:03,230
it's just to give you a framing for for

62
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:04,579
what we do thank you I feel like a

63
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,480
complete idiot now I'm standing in front

64
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:07,480
of a couple hundred people

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:19,880
sakes okay magic and magic okay yeah we

66
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,440
do so we do we do statistical methods to

67
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:26,829
find attackers in computer networks and

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,769
that sort of looks like a graph now Gabe

69
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,780
Gabe Gabe gave a lot of fodder for you

70
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:35,420
guys to think about and a lot of things

71
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,810
that I agree with very much after 20

72
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,069
years of playing with this kind of data

73
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,069
you're gonna see a lot of visualizations

74
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:45,619
for me actually we just do computing and

75
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:48,109
the graph is the topology upon which we

76
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,680
work and the ways in which we combine

77
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,630
data together but we don't actually do a

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,730
lot of visualization we just use

79
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,250
computers to analyze data and the data

80
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,798
has a topology which is a graph it's

81
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,780
helpful for me to visualize it for you

82
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,430
guys so I can explain some concepts but

83
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,930
I'm not actually presenting these to

84
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,910
customers for the most part you might

85
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,590
see a couple towards the end why

86
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,410
statistics as opposed to machine

87
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,160
learning so there's a big topic we spend

88
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:22,700
a few few days on that probably actually

89
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,680
the math is the same in many cases

90
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,000
between statistical methods and machine

91
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,460
learning it's the same math we typically

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,760
like to build as Gabe said earlier sort

93
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:38,180
of simple statistical models which are

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,370
easy to update which have parameters

95
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,289
which we can which help us understand

96
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,410
the data and therefore help our

97
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:48,440
customers understand what we're finding

98
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,330
in the data so statistical methods with

99
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:56,000
interpretive parameters for the most

100
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:57,770
part and on on graphical data okay

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,460
that's a pretty good background there's

102
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,139
a graph

103
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,849
yeah that's pretty useless from the

104
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,620
computing perspective but it does help

105
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,220
me sort of explain what I'm talking

106
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,639
about so this is an enterprise network

107
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,789
the nodes are computers little tiny dots

108
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:16,430
the edges are network communications in

109
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:20,719
the form of net flow measured from the

110
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,150
routers and the switches and I'm really

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,480
just trying to tell you yeah

112
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,760
job is to find a sort of tiny little bit

113
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,170
which is represented by the blue here of

114
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,190
a lateral movement of an attacker

115
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,190
through the network

116
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,310
eventually stealing data and we use a

117
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,800
lot of things to do that threat

118
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,620
intelligence up at the top do I have it

119
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,300
yeah so this is just sort of telling us

120
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,220
about the Internet you know and

121
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,360
reputations on the internet and things

122
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:53,620
that we should be sensitive to as they

123
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:58,920
start to penetrate the network this this

124
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,920
here is is phishing and somebody clicked

125
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:06,520
by the way don't click on anything ever

126
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:11,470
ever don't ever click on it lateral

127
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:15,090
movement there are several elements of

128
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:18,280
this which I'm going to go into later

129
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,109
it's not just okay I have a credential

130
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,219
I'm moving around the network yeh it's

131
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,960
more like there's reconnaissance there's

132
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,380
installation of persistence

133
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,270
there's command and control but

134
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,740
eventually you know they get to the

135
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,659
right place it's in the network they've

136
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,540
got the right data and they steal it and

137
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,740
they steal it out of the network and so

138
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,260
I'm actually going to spend a little

139
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,570
more time on those elements here I'm

140
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,430
sort of walking you through I'm setting

141
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,740
things up because at some point I'm

142
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,390
going to tell you methods for how we can

143
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,540
find this kind of thing and probably

144
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,950
this is pretty well understood by many

145
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,880
in the audience in terms of attack

146
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:03,250
behaviors it's also a gross

147
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,080
simplification and obscure pin lots of

148
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,980
stuff and this isn't the only thing they

149
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:12,250
do so just bear with me in terms of

150
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:16,090
explaining some of these methods because

151
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,730
it's it's it's a general sort of

152
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,289
framework for attacks but actually

153
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,850
specifically wrong in almost every

154
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,910
setting if that makes sense it just

155
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:27,670
helps me explain so initial penetration

156
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:31,480
and I'm going to talk about a couple of

157
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:33,520
concepts here one is nodes and edges

158
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,789
okay that's a graph

159
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,690
but another is that attackers introduced

160
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:45,099
deviation from what we expect and that's

161
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,840
where we get into anomaly detection it

162
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,280
turns out the attackers don't tell us a

163
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,659
lot if I go back

164
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:55,559
they don't actually tell us they're

165
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:59,789
doing this we don't have label data and

166
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:05,500
so not only do we not have label data

167
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:07,690
but if you can imagine that well you

168
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,849
know okay that didn't work because we

169
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,729
because we predicted it somehow was

170
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:15,400
supervised machine learning then they

171
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,530
may just go over here instead and so

172
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,729
even if we did have labeled data I would

173
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,590
postulate that we don't have

174
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,940
representative labeled data of the

175
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,880
number of different things that the

176
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,219
attacker could do because of the big

177
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,949
complexity and combinatorics of a graph

178
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,459
they don't have to move from A to B they

179
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:34,120
can move from A to C and from C to D and

180
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,159
that kind of thing blows up

181
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,010
exponentially in terms of their options

182
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,419
so for those two reasons

183
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:45,790
they don't tell us what they do we don't

184
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:49,180
have good label data and the data of

185
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:51,969
today is not necessarily representative

186
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,699
of the attack behaviors tomorrow we

187
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,010
typically do unsupervised methods so

188
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,810
that's going to sort of set up some of

189
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,610
the discussion about the attack behavior

190
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,579
and what we're gonna do about it

191
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,610
so the nodes are computers in this case

192
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:08,620
or they could be users or they could be

193
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:12,100
any kind of entity that we can observe

194
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,860
in this case cartoon it's a phishing

195
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:19,839
email sender somewhere out on the

196
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,940
internet and the edges are some kind of

197
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,529
observable communication actually they

198
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,940
don't have to be observable they could

199
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:28,149
be inferred and we could figure that out

200
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:32,200
from similarity or other things but in

201
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:35,620
this case it's an observed email being

202
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,230
sent from a phishing cinder on the

203
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:43,050
Internet to a set of users inside of the

204
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:45,520
enterprise and again cartoon there's a

205
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,420
perimeter here just so you know what's

206
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,370
in the Internet

207
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:53,680
what's in the enterprise okay and so yay

208
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:56,560
phishing email somebody's gonna happily

209
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,040
click many people will click on these

210
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,489
things and then you know the next thing

211
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:07,019
that may happen is that the browser is

212
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:13,089
directed to a malicious website and then

213
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:15,690
malware is downloaded and installed by

214
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:18,370
the way I I didn't mention but red means

215
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,889
there's been a change from what we

216
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,199
expect it's actually let me back up a

217
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,420
little because I have more time so I'm

218
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:31,089
gonna I'm gonna talk I'm gonna fill my

219
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:34,410
time up here so imagine so examples of

220
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:37,630
deviation from what we expect okay

221
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:40,480
yeah okay you got the natural language

222
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:43,750
in the email right and so you can ask

223
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,860
questions like is there bad grammar or

224
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,779
is there spelling mistakes is it what's

225
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,370
the tone of the language is it trying to

226
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:56,529
get you to do something like click on an

227
00:10:51,370 --> 00:11:01,449
email is there a link in it those things

228
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:05,709
have some deviation or some scoring that

229
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:07,630
we can do okay to estimate the

230
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:10,060
probability that this is not a phishing

231
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,680
email and I said not a phishing email

232
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,380
not is a phishing email because we

233
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,680
mostly model what's normal and quantify

234
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,930
deviation from normal okay so what's the

235
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,420
probability this isn't an email another

236
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,649
one that some people have thought of I

237
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:29,019
actually haven't seen it publish but

238
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:31,720
maybe it is is what's the how uncommon

239
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:35,010
is the set of recipients for this email

240
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,290
with respect to how our organization

241
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,510
normally receives emails and we could

242
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,139
probably quantify that for example our

243
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,430
CEO such an Adela and I don't receive a

244
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:48,519
lot of the same emails

245
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:51,099
I wouldn't mind receiving more in common

246
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,139
with him but normally you know if I get

247
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,620
an email and he does yeah that's a

248
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:58,839
little weird it's not a smoking gun it's

249
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,340
not none of this is a smoking gun and

250
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,250
I'm a statistician so

251
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:07,570
I don't do zeros and ones I do I don't

252
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,670
know maybe kind of you know 0.2 point

253
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,070
zero one that kind of stuff that's what

254
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,500
I floating numbers between zero and one

255
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:17,430
actually is is sort of what I think

256
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,380
about so with all of these say sort of

257
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,630
evidence of it's not a it's not a

258
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,770
phishing email put together I'm gonna be

259
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:29,500
able to score the red that I'm seeing

260
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,630
here in terms of how much deviation the

261
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:37,120
attacker has introduced from what I

262
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:39,610
expect again attack so the user clicks

263
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,720
what's the reputation of that website is

264
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:45,700
it new on the Internet is it linked by

265
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,260
other websites

266
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,060
what's this reputation there's lots of

267
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,000
ways to do this and lots of literature

268
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,800
and techniques to do this but what I

269
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,630
want you to get the idea of is there's a

270
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,930
score associated we can put a score

271
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:01,420
associated with the edge the fact that

272
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:05,130
this machine went to that website

273
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,130
what's the score for that

274
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:14,029
reconnaissance so yeah

275
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:16,999
turns out that was malicious let's say

276
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:18,829
there was a zero-day an exploit that got

277
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:20,959
in there only operates if they got a

278
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:25,248
credential they're logged in to this

279
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:29,268
computer from outside through the

280
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:31,910
firewall that's a breach that's what EDR

281
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:36,790
works on that's what we try to find is

282
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:39,319
after they've done that the attacker may

283
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,379
explore the network so one of the

284
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:45,349
advantages we have as defenders is we

285
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:47,420
know what's normal right or we can know

286
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,499
if we have good visibility and actually

287
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:55,878
bother to try to understand our networks

288
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:58,209
and yet the attacker or to some extent

289
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,980
and some of you may be more

290
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:04,189
sophisticated than at this than others

291
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,410
but you know to some extent that they

292
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:08,299
won't know what's what's in the net

293
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,579
what's in the enterprise until they get

294
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:13,730
in and they'll have to explore so you'll

295
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:15,559
see port scanning that's one way to do

296
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:19,279
it so they they're on the box

297
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:21,199
they'll yeah horizontal port scanning

298
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,939
that's where they're gonna they've got

299
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,799
one thing they're looking for like SQL

300
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:28,549
they're looking for a database right at

301
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:31,429
an SQL and so they'll emit ping requests

302
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:34,189
or some other kind of login requests or

303
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:36,619
something else to try to find SQL

304
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:39,379
servers among a whole bunch of machines

305
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:40,579
out there are actually in credential

306
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,110
escalation which is that they really

307
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,209
trying to do they're trying to find the

308
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,459
Active Directory right and so they'll

309
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,258
ask where is it where is it who knows

310
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:51,109
about it

311
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:52,790
that causes changes in the normal

312
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,449
network communications that we would

313
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,519
observe in this in this case you know we

314
00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:02,089
may these two computers may actually

315
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,889
talk to each other normally right in but

316
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,589
they may not be talking on the port's

317
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:08,689
that they are now talking on or they may

318
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:10,939
not be talking with the same number of

319
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:13,910
bytes and packets or even deeper into

320
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:16,309
the packet contents itself in the ways

321
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,618
in which they're talking again we can

322
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:19,939
quantify the deviation from what we

323
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:22,879
expect between the

324
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:24,439
to computers here's another one is those

325
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,159
two computers have never talked to each

326
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:30,769
other before that's pretty weird how do

327
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,720
you quantify how weird that is well it's

328
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,129
kind of tricky because you did again I

329
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,949
don't want to say 0 & 1

330
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:39,289
I don't do that so how do I score the

331
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:41,598
probability that these two computers are

332
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:43,459
going to talk to each other and I've got

333
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:45,019
some papers on that and others do it's

334
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:49,579
we call it a new edge in this sort of

335
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:52,669
network research literature obviously

336
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:54,169
like there are some computers that have

337
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:56,259
a high propensity to talk to other

338
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:58,639
computers in a new way new

339
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:01,309
communications that happens there are

340
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,609
servers that receive new communications

341
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:06,978
all the time that happens so you can

342
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:09,259
combine the sort of propensity for the

343
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:10,819
source to make new connections and the

344
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,189
propensity for the destination to

345
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:16,368
receive them to get a probability for

346
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:18,858
this new edge for example okay so I just

347
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:20,569
described sort of existing edges and

348
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:23,659
understanding what's normal with them

349
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:25,098
and then scoring this one and also new

350
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:27,470
edges where you haven't ever seen them

351
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:30,189
talk to each other and trying to score

352
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:33,199
the probability of an observed new edge

353
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:37,179
I'm look I'm seeing is this making sense

354
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:43,098
to folks who heads nodding okay thanks

355
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:44,869
right so reconnaissance lateral movement

356
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:48,169
everybody's favorite this one's really

357
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,949
hard it's really hard fine lateral it's

358
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:51,470
behavioral

359
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:54,858
they're usually using system tools they

360
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,679
may just RDP right it's already P weird

361
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:58,479
not really if you look at all Network it

362
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:04,759
happens a lot

363
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:09,189
admins do it all the time SSH for Linux

364
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,189
nerds which I'm one of them ironically

365
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:16,188
so lateral movements really hard it's

366
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:20,089
one thing to take away for this but we

367
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:23,629
can score combinations or paths Gabe was

368
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:26,480
talking about paths we can score unusual

369
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:27,980
paths in the network and I've got some

370
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,730
papers others have some papers on that

371
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,730
subjects

372
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,330
we can score the processes that are

373
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:42,389
running to allow for remote

374
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:45,720
communications like WMI or win RM or SSH

375
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:48,270
or RDP there are processes here right

376
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,790
that are associated so the end point has

377
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,680
stuff running on it and the pair of

378
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:56,580
communicating computers has some signal

379
00:17:52,680 --> 00:18:00,000
in it and we can score paths in order to

380
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,280
find or quantify our belief that this is

381
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,040
not lateral that was weird that was a

382
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,690
weird statement again I flip it around

383
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,430
I'm always looking for normal and I'm

384
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,460
looking for evidence against normal and

385
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:14,120
that's what these scores are and

386
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,040
statistics will compy values by the way

387
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,830
okay here's another little bit of

388
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,590
cartoon is alright they found all the

389
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,300
data that they wanted maybe it's all the

390
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,470
credentials for your from your Active

391
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:31,080
Directory that was bad don't want that

392
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:34,620
and they may need to consolidate them

393
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:38,909
into a single place just for convenience

394
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:41,550
or actually to try to stay quiet so this

395
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,320
is known as data staging they'll move

396
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,530
stuff from a variety of sources in the

397
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,960
network into a central place and then

398
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,870
they'll tar it or roar it or zip it or

399
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,470
whatever and then they'll steal it out

400
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:58,080
of the network

401
00:18:52,470 --> 00:19:00,270
exfiltration and again volumes of data

402
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,970
flowing to a central machine that are

403
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:06,090
unusual with respect to models that we

404
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,890
expect are going to be able to flag this

405
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,929
so if you have bites and packets you can

406
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,940
see the aggregation of data into a

407
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,710
central machine that is unexpected from

408
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,460
what's normally happening on that on

409
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:19,710
that machine sort of vertex based and

410
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,810
this is like an in star the

411
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:25,700
reconnaissance is like an out star from

412
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:28,379
a vertex these things are like pads

413
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,650
exfiltration lots of stuff you can do

414
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,110
here the reputation of the machine that

415
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,210
you're talking to how unusual the

416
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:40,409
communication between the two machines

417
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:43,500
are what was happening a process wise on

418
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,370
the machine the amount of bytes modeled

419
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,860
as a time seer

420
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:49,350
over time between to this computer and

421
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:53,159
this other computer or maybe any

422
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,929
computer on the Internet lots of stuff

423
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,630
you can put together none of which is a

424
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:01,980
smoking gun I'll tell you another story

425
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:03,780
so another way to look at this is the

426
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,390
flip it on its head this is how we can

427
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:12,120
sort of track it and quantify it but

428
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:13,650
what if you miss it so let's say I'm

429
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,780
gonna pick on Microsoft a little bit

430
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,660
which is ironic I work for Microsoft I'm

431
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,950
very happy Microsoft employee but I'm

432
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,440
gonna pick on Microsoft because it's

433
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:25,940
this the enterprise software that that

434
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:29,460
we deploy and sell all over the world so

435
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,920
and I do I say this because my brothers

436
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,450
and sisters in office are working just

437
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,260
as hard as I am to defend these

438
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:40,950
enterprises okay so we have office we

439
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:44,780
it's got office 365 has great fishing

440
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,980
detection some wonderful people that do

441
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,309
incredible things with deep learning and

442
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,240
in a and really really impressive

443
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:57,090
machine learning work over there and yet

444
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,710
they'll see something come in and they

445
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,100
know they've got a little bit signal for

446
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:04,500
it and say I don't know a point zero one

447
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,780
percent chance that it's a bad guy or a

448
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,880
phishing phishing email I get emails

449
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:13,649
exchange exchange servers and things and

450
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,940
and yeah they know the researchers know

451
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,520
they'll be looking at that data they

452
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,130
know it's a phishing email and they

453
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,100
can't fire on it because if they do

454
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:26,490
they'll have 40,000 false positives half

455
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:30,570
our customers will be a mad at us false

456
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:33,840
positives right customer pain analysts

457
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,159
pain to hate us when we do that so it so

458
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,199
even though the researchers know that's

459
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,720
a phishing email you know it they have

460
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,580
to let it go through because at scale we

461
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,900
can't fire on that with a bunt without a

462
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,649
bunch of false positives

463
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:49,679
okay so it goes through goes through

464
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:51,840
then zero day exploit right it gets on

465
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,500
the end point Windows Defender

466
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,590
the researchers know we know we see it

467
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,330
we can't fire on it 50

468
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:04,129
million false positives and those guys

469
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:06,799
have massive scale so a V you know you

470
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:09,140
fire false positive a V man you're dead

471
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:14,900
like everybody hates you like you're

472
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:17,059
hated so so so we don't fire so we don't

473
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,070
fire and then all of this other nasty

474
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,690
stuff happens and the EDR can't fire

475
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,928
because none of these things are strong

476
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:28,250
enough in isolation to fire on them

477
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:30,409
without a too many false positives and

478
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,720
this is how breaches happened and this

479
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:35,090
is how nation-states penetrate our

480
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,649
networks and steal our data is because

481
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:41,449
any one of these individual things isn't

482
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:44,629
strong enough and so that's why graphs

483
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,279
are important is because we can use

484
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,429
graphs to consolidate all of this

485
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:52,549
together all of these weak signals that

486
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:55,190
in isolation we can't fire on because

487
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:57,590
too many false positives together can be

488
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,649
extremely concerning holy crap we saw

489
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,779
this yeah it's pretty unusual email but

490
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:04,908
also all the evidence from the endpoint

491
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:07,159
and then the lateral movement in the

492
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:09,799
network if you put that together it's

493
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,110
instead of like point zero one chance

494
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:15,020
it's a bad guy it's like 99 percent

495
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,178
chance it's a bad guy so they're like a

496
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,210
multiplicative or geometric effect on

497
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:21,710
the on the probabilities being

498
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,850
correlated together in the right way and

499
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,399
that's where the graph comes in that's

500
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,469
why the graph is important for us is

501
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:30,379
it's the way to connect all of the

502
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,730
attack data together and make it stand

503
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,409
out of the noise so that's the next

504
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,690
thing I'm going to talk about here's

505
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:37,370
another cartoon that's this is just like

506
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,169
putting all of that other stuff I just

507
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,719
talked about together into one graph and

508
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:44,659
then I'm putting little Greek numbers on

509
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,850
all of the nodes and edges to represent

510
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:50,830
the scores that we have extracted from

511
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:53,750
each of these behaviors okay and so now

512
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,668
imagine again that this this is the

513
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,169
attack we know it well here it is we

514
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,520
found it but actually finding it is

515
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:02,809
really hard that's right that's what we

516
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:05,649
try to do so so you imagine that this is

517
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:11,100
do I have another slide that yeah so

518
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:13,289
this is embedded in that right so

519
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,289
like this tiny little thing it's tiny

520
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:18,389
and again this is a ridiculous graph

521
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,889
completely unusable the reason I'm

522
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:22,500
putting it up there is to show you it's

523
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:25,258
impossible to find this and that or is

524
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,730
it no it's not it's not impossible we

525
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:33,600
can find it and we can find it through

526
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:35,730
finding a subgraph of scores which are

527
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,299
connected and consistent with the attack

528
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,529
behavior within this giant graph so

529
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:45,059
that's what I'm gonna sort of talk about

530
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:46,080
next is given actually next I think I'm

531
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,730
going to talk about how to get some

532
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,350
scores and I'm gonna go into a little

533
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,320
bit of statistics and know what people

534
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:55,080
fall asleep and so forth and then and

535
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,149
then I'm gonna talk about how to if you

536
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,070
have a graph with scores on it like

537
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:01,739
every node and edge has scores on it

538
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,809
this whole thing how can you find this

539
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,309
little tiny bit within that okay so

540
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:07,950
that's sort of a sketch for the rest of

541
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:09,450
the rest of the graph and I rest the

542
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:16,139
talk and I should look at what time I've

543
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:20,370
got I'm okay I'm okay right here's how

544
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:24,529
to score an edge one way to score an

545
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:28,559
edge this is a this is number of failed

546
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:34,019
RDP logins from the Internet to a given

547
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:37,440
machine inside an enterprise ok and man

548
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:40,740
it's a mess so and I apologize like it's

549
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,769
probably hard to see but the red red

550
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:47,639
line is a statistical model but is it

551
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:52,830
it's a it's a zero inflated negative

552
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:55,918
binomial with seasonality fancy-fancy it

553
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,949
understands the time of day it

554
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,320
understands variability between what we

555
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,149
expect and what we're observing so a

556
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,539
blue dots are the number of logins sorry

557
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:08,508
number of logins the red line you can

558
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:11,820
sort of see it here sorry about the I

559
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:14,429
should make that line thicker these

560
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,168
humps are days right you can see that

561
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:19,649
from the data you can see here's a

562
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:22,679
weekend so this machine doesn't receive

563
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:23,330
a lot of incoming failed RDP log and

564
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,340
requests

565
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:30,918
on the weekend or less than it does

566
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:36,259
during the week the distance between the

567
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:39,679
line which is the model and the observed

568
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:43,639
blue dots those are the number of logins

569
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,549
we've observed okay is a way to

570
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:50,059
understand the deviation between what

571
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:54,470
we're observing what we expect make

572
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:56,830
sense in video kay I'm gonna dive into

573
00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:01,070
the deep end here it's actually

574
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:03,619
probabilistic in that it's not a like a

575
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:07,279
Euclidean distance it's not X minus mu

576
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:09,709
quantity squared it's the probability

577
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:13,850
under a parametric model negative

578
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:15,200
binomial of observing this data given

579
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,090
that we've learned over time what's

580
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,239
normal

581
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:26,749
this guy was observed I've that's a blue

582
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:31,460
there's a blue dot there baby logins per

583
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:35,869
minute happened for one minute on a

584
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:41,509
Saturday in March that's a successful

585
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:43,519
brute-force logger so we found it and we

586
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:47,210
found it by quantifying what's normal

587
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:50,570
and and then calculating these deviation

588
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:54,169
scores these alpha eyes so that's a way

589
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:56,059
to score so let's go back and say like

590
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:57,529
initial penetration I talked about a

591
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:00,830
phishing email in this case it's a

592
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:03,379
brute-force RDP attempts where they're

593
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,789
guests in a password and yeah they

594
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:07,039
guessed the right one and there was a

595
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:10,429
successful login after this and a breach

596
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,730
happens okay okay so that's how you

597
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:16,759
score that's how that's one way to score

598
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:20,299
edges communications between the

599
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:24,109
Internet and a machine okay but you can

600
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:24,499
also score nodes and that's cool what is

601
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:29,029
that

602
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:30,830
I'm just kidding I know it this is this

603
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:33,169
is a PowerShell

604
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,379
this is a representation of a PowerShell

605
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,690
script that ran on a

606
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:41,790
an endpoint okay it doesn't really look

607
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:47,130
like a PowerShell script it's a it's an

608
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:51,510
embedding of the PowerShell script as as

609
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,640
elements in a you know an embedding so

610
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:57,420
they they extract the text of the

611
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:00,320
PowerShell script and convert it into

612
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,550
some numbers and then I'm sort of

613
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,020
skipping over some details because

614
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:07,700
actually there's a deep learning model

615
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:09,870
here and it's and but it gives you some

616
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,810
numerical understanding of the semantic

617
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,570
relationship between the words by the

618
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:20,460
way amir rubin a colleague of mine in

619
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:23,610
israel and so like you could see that

620
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:29,850
like logical statements are close to

621
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:31,919
each other i which actually is a bit of

622
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,010
magic because we had to convert natural

623
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,890
language into a quantity in order to put

624
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:41,310
it close together okay and so and you

625
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:43,380
can see downloading and and sort of web

626
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:46,850
behavior is close to each other and

627
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:49,920
things like that and so this kind of

628
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,959
semantic understanding with a computer

629
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,990
if we were in the living computer museum

630
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,450
so that makes sense we should do that is

631
00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:00,030
how we've been coded a powershell which

632
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:02,880
is sort of a human language it's not

633
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:05,460
really it's a machine language but sort

634
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,830
of the human level of it into something

635
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,530
that we can then score and quantify

636
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:12,179
again the deviation from what we expect

637
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:14,310
and what we're observing in this case

638
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,430
it's on a note it's it's a script

639
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:21,450
running on a computer okay and we can

640
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:25,500
say that one has a score associated with

641
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:30,300
it and and we can quantify that in this

642
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:32,520
case this is actually able to find

643
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,680
attackers on its own as well because

644
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,250
attackers write powershell scripts that

645
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,780
this thing will pick up and there's a

646
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,520
supervised machine learning approach for

647
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,010
those who are wondering supervised

648
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,930
machine learning approach that makes a

649
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,590
decision is this a malicious powershell

650
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,110
script or

651
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,330
but what I want to again get across to

652
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,490
you guys is in addition to it making a

653
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:57,059
decision about this PowerShell script it

654
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:59,669
can also extract a score which in this

655
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:02,399
case is the distance some probabilistic

656
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:04,169
distance between the decision line of

657
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,219
the supervised classifier and the

658
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:10,889
observed point okay so instead of

659
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:14,159
thinking it's bad or good I think it's

660
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:16,139
point seven nine and I'm gonna take that

661
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,179
score and again I'm gonna combine it so

662
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:20,580
there's this is an example of a node

663
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,409
score we had an example of an edge score

664
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:29,908
now you guys know all about scoring

665
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:33,059
nodes and edges next okay so now I'm

666
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:34,889
shifting gears a little bit now assume

667
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,999
we have scored all the nodes and edges

668
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:37,860
everything's great

669
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:40,019
scored all the nodes and edges but we

670
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,350
still have to find that sub graph within

671
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:46,309
that giant graph right how do we do that

672
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:51,178
and so this is a real is a real attack

673
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:52,559
again and I'm going to describe one

674
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,539
algorithm I'm going to walk you through

675
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,360
a couple algorithms for finding local

676
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:59,009
sub graphs of attack behavior given a

677
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,178
giant graph with scores on the nodes and

678
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:05,580
edges and so first I want to say like

679
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:08,820
the nodes again in this case our

680
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,799
computers the lines between the nodes

681
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,189
are authentication events in this case

682
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:18,049
credential usage the Kerberos are in CLM

683
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:21,240
and the color is proportional to the

684
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:24,990
score I put on the edges remember I was

685
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,379
scoring the edges I've just made a

686
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,600
pretty picture that has the score per

687
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:34,830
port the color proportional to the score

688
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,139
that I under the hood made okay and so

689
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:41,369
here's a greedy algorithm for

690
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:42,990
discovering within this larger graph the

691
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:44,699
sub graph that I want to show the

692
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,919
analysts are I want to alert on or

693
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,049
whatever in a way I'm going to do it in

694
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,600
this case is heuristic it's a greedy

695
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:53,759
algorithm it's gonna say find the score

696
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,168
that's smallest remember I've got scores

697
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,740
on all the nodes and edges so find the

698
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:59,330
smallest score and I

699
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,240
when I was making these slides I just

700
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,949
had like an algorithm like yeah yeah I

701
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,809
could write a four I could write a while

702
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,880
loop here so that's what I'm actually

703
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:11,600
just talking to you about it just you

704
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,669
know find the smaller the Alpha which is

705
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,549
smallest sort sort all the alphas for

706
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:18,980
the nodes and edges all the scores find

707
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:22,600
the smallest one start there crawl along

708
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:26,419
the graph find the weirdest next hop

709
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,668
collect that score

710
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:30,260
combine it with your score I might have

711
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,419
a slide about how to combine scores

712
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:36,260
together there's lots of papers about

713
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:38,570
doing this and then have some stopping

714
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:42,320
criterion like we can no longer collect

715
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:45,289
more badness stop and report simple

716
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,870
greedy algorithm try to find the

717
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:51,110
subgraph of most anomalous we're most

718
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:54,830
concerning scores okay that's one way to

719
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:57,229
do it so here it is a build of that oops

720
00:33:54,830 --> 00:34:00,010
that node we looked weirdest after the

721
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:03,620
edge oops that edge looks weirdest and

722
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:07,149
then just recurse until you're done some

723
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,149
kind of stopping condition okay

724
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,668
oh by the way you can see there that's

725
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,020
reconnaissance remember I was talking

726
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:15,299
about they like reach out and try to

727
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,830
find the next place to go to that's what

728
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,640
they were doing and then they move down

729
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:26,340
here and then they moved over here okay

730
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:29,639
here's another one it's really hard to

731
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,810
make slides that explain this well so

732
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,020
I'm just gonna have to talk you through

733
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:41,969
it apologies but instead of having like

734
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:44,580
a greedy algorithm because you know you

735
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:46,408
might because of signal and noise and

736
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,569
data collection and all kinds of other

737
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:53,220
things you might miss an edge or a node

738
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:54,929
and that greedy algorithm or maybe that

739
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:56,279
the attacker just didn't introduce very

740
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,280
much signal and move in through that

741
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,960
edge or over that node but then they

742
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,060
didn't but then they become more evident

743
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,330
later and so you could think of some

744
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,070
randomization to allow you to hop over

745
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,810
normal edges or normal nodes to get some

746
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,310
more weirdness and you could try to do

747
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,990
that algorithmically that's a good idea

748
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,810
you should try you should try that at

749
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:21,029
work's but also another way to do it is

750
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:24,120
to sort of define some templates and

751
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:26,730
then search for and then enumerate that

752
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:30,779
template in your giant graph everywhere

753
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:32,310
you can't collect the scores from those

754
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,500
little small templates like here's a

755
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:37,110
path and here's a and here's a star

756
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,550
those are templates that I'm gonna slide

757
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,620
over the whole graph

758
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:43,590
I'm gonna enumerate the path all the

759
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,450
paths of length three there are three

760
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:48,540
edges in this one I'm going to numerate

761
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:51,120
all of them four billion four hundred

762
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,610
billion a trillion there may be a lot of

763
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,980
them and I'm gonna calculate some

764
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,120
combined score across all the alphas for

765
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,860
that path

766
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,810
for all those paths I'm going to do it

767
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,670
for all the stars and then I'm gonna

768
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,770
threshold I'm gonna say the combined

769
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,170
score for these objects I'm gonna find

770
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:10,259
the weirdest ones and I'm gonna report

771
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,850
those to the analyst so subtle

772
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,350
difference from the greedy one is here

773
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,520
I'm going to define a template I'm going

774
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,410
to slide it all over the whole network

775
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,370
and I'm gonna try to find the weirdest

776
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,230
subgraphs

777
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,490
because the scores are all saying yeah

778
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,770
that's weird

779
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:27,879
okay and there's a paper if you want to

780
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:30,700
read it there are problems with this I

781
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,690
tell you when you start a numerating

782
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:36,310
paths and Gabe knows I'm sure Gabe knows

783
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,970
you get a lot of them there's a lot of

784
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:40,660
false positives this suffers from what

785
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:45,129
statisticians would call the multiple

786
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:48,270
testing problem so issues with this to

787
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,890
be sure but it's another method

788
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:53,860
okay and now spectral methods these are

789
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:58,750
among the more cutting-edge in our

790
00:36:53,860 --> 00:37:01,360
research team so let's see and I don't

791
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:04,690
have this up on the on this slide deck

792
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:08,880
but an adjacency matrix some of you will

793
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:15,240
nod your heads it's a matrix

794
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:18,369
dido mean Keanu Reeves in the rows are

795
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:22,060
nodes and in the column are nodes and

796
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:25,869
I'm gonna put a 1 if there is an edge

797
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:28,990
between a node on row on row X and a

798
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:30,730
node on row on column Y and that's an

799
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,549
adjacency matrix and I don't have that

800
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,350
here but it's just a giant matrix that

801
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:38,260
describes the connectivity the nodes and

802
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:42,130
edges okay and you can do all kinds of

803
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:44,800
linear algebra with that and you can

804
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:47,619
take that holistic graph and you can

805
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:52,690
look for spectral embeddings basically

806
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:54,790
look for decompose it into eigenvectors

807
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,560
and eigenvalues and then find the right

808
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,869
eigenvectors and eigenvalues that

809
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,240
represent the kind of shapes you want to

810
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:02,770
pick up in the graph and remember you

811
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,229
know the kind of shapes we have they

812
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:07,690
they look like that or like that right

813
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:10,960
and so we can design spectral methods

814
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:15,250
that identify the combination of nodes

815
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:19,240
and edges with scores that are unusual

816
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:20,920
from a spectral perspective and and boy

817
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,779
I'm waving my hands a lot this is not

818
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:28,780
simple stuff you know there are papers

819
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,940
here and this is this is hard work and I

820
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,400
think it

821
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,580
[Music]

822
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,800
so two methods to sort of describe one

823
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:40,940
is imagine you've got a time series of

824
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:44,900
graphs so you observe you observe that

825
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:46,550
this thing let's say over multiple time

826
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,950
steps which is actually what's happening

827
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:51,740
here the nodes and edges are time series

828
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:56,870
models and so we're observing this over

829
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:58,970
time but in this in this in the setting

830
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:02,330
of spectral methods we can observe whole

831
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,859
graph so at a time like in minute one we

832
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:07,370
have this graph in minute 2 we have this

833
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:09,530
graph they change subtly and this

834
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:12,109
particular method is about identifying

835
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:15,460
those changes from a spectral approach

836
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:18,530
in the sequence of time series of graphs

837
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:21,050
and that's about all I should do I'm

838
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,660
going to murder you guys somebody that's

839
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:27,320
probably already too much another way to

840
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:31,819
do it is to again use a spectral

841
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:33,440
embedding from from the adjacency matrix

842
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:38,920
or something they call the graph

843
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:45,980
laplacian and then identify clusters in

844
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:48,740
the spectra in a in the embedded graphs

845
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:51,530
in terms of those nodes and the scores

846
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,060
on the nodes and edges and so I don't

847
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,490
think you're going to be able to extract

848
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,990
a whole lot from the words I just said

849
00:39:54,490 --> 00:40:00,470
it's it's actually quite hard to explain

850
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:02,930
here and there's a paper and in in in

851
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,339
the works that will we'll publish but by

852
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:08,120
the way we can find attackers with it

853
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:10,340
there they are and and I skipped ahead

854
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,980
but we here they are these are them

855
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,840
actually these are us that's me and my

856
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:18,260
team doing weird logins between each

857
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:21,620
other and able to find that as the most

858
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,450
anomalous thing so research you know we

859
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,600
trying new stuff out here and I think

860
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:29,120
it's gonna work and I'm very excited

861
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:36,020
about the next set of spectral methods

862
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:37,850
here and I think that's about it but you

863
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,230
know there's a lot of people that work

864
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,720
on these things and I tried to give

865
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,270
credit where I can but

866
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,779
man my team are rock stars and I'm so

867
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:49,240
proud of working with them and and so

868
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:56,170
they did all of this and so I'm really

869
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:59,669
good and that's it questions let's start

870
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:03,130
you were the first one to go thank you

871
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:07,180
the time difference between the start

872
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:09,130
node and node what a time width are you

873
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,660
using or if you found an average one

874
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:13,300
that works well or going to modify it

875
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,500
based on what you're looking for yeah

876
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,630
how much does that translate into

877
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,770
obviously that the massive number of

878
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,700
nodes you're keeping in memory and the

879
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,190
data store to worms

880
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,210
yeah so let's see there was a whole

881
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,070
bunch of questions there but they're

882
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,320
mostly about time and I think they're

883
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:34,390
mostly about the time period that the

884
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:35,620
attack takes and that's a hard one we

885
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:40,089
don't know again they don't tell us

886
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:41,890
right and so there's a former member of

887
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:46,030
the US government

888
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:49,120
I saw Gabe as well I can tell you in our

889
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:52,090
observations in that space were anywhere

890
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:56,940
from from five minutes this is

891
00:41:52,090 --> 00:42:00,250
interactive attackers like not malware

892
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,820
anywhere from five minutes to a couple

893
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:06,250
years so there's so much variability

894
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,770
right and how do you handle the low and

895
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:12,010
slow right versus the versus the the

896
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:13,570
fast ones in memory and in compute and

897
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,730
all of these things I don't have good

898
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,670
answers what I do have our statistical

899
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:20,070
approaches so there's these things

900
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,510
called kusum's

901
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:27,430
which are able to accumulate either

902
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:29,500
point in time a concern like that brute

903
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:31,990
force you saw it was just like boom that

904
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,880
minute it was completely crazy but

905
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:37,569
they're also able to accumulate moderate

906
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:40,300
anomalous Nisour concern over longer

907
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:41,860
periods of time and it's a statistical

908
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:45,460
decision as to whether you want to alert

909
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:47,980
or not so I don't have I mean I can tell

910
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,510
you you know anywhere from five minutes

911
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,569
to two years and that's not very helpful

912
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:54,699
I can tell you we try to mod or

913
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:57,069
our risk and not detecting those kind of

914
00:42:54,699 --> 00:43:00,400
things using control charts theory of

915
00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:02,199
statistical control theory to try to

916
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,839
either capture those point in time

917
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:10,299
anomalies or the slowly accumulating

918
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:12,459
ones over time yeah yeah that's right

919
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:14,759
yeah it is thank you for your question

920
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,759
yes sir

921
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,930
just shown is available

922
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:37,119
so the question was datacenters JP

923
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:39,489
Morgan JP Morgan and how much

924
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,029
open-source code is there and papers

925
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:44,410
such that you can replicate this work

926
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:47,679
thank you for asking and I'm a scientist

927
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:50,709
of I like to claim yeah well they put in

928
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,359
my title anyway I'm not sure but I do

929
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:54,729
like to participate in the open-source

930
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:58,089
community so it cut from our work in

931
00:43:54,729 --> 00:44:03,390
particular I would point you at my

932
00:43:58,089 --> 00:44:07,949
Google Scholar page to start with and

933
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:12,069
I've got plenty of papers there we are

934
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:17,049
early days in my team of publications

935
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:20,979
and where we're working on it so we're

936
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:22,869
gonna get you more papers soon some of

937
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:26,169
this work was done outside of Microsoft

938
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:32,529
I should say and you can see most of

939
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:34,089
that for my Google Scholar page I'm

940
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:37,900
gonna use this as a little bit of a

941
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:40,749
platform as the community wants our data

942
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:43,689
and our code and I want to give it to

943
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:45,538
them in a way that is compliant and

944
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:50,739
preserves the privacy of our customers

945
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:53,009
so we have efforts in place to do

946
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:57,160
anonymize data releases which do

947
00:44:53,009 --> 00:44:59,049
compliant privacy-preserving release so

948
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,328
that we can collaborate with our

949
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:04,809
industry and academic partners and

950
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:07,749
that's not easy and requires a lot of

951
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:10,089
work in compliance and in legal things

952
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:14,160
in order to get past those hurdles but

953
00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:14,160
I'd like you to know that I'm extremely

954
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:22,539
interested in the collaboration and in

955
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:26,829
that we can do with academics in an open

956
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:28,900
source and an open way so that you can

957
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:30,699
bang away at our methods and try to find

958
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,439
where they're not working so that I can

959
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:36,779
provide better security for my customers

960
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:36,779
so I absolutely agree with

961
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:06,660
yeah and so let's see let me try to

962
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,180
repeat that question said a lot of this

963
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,580
is from infrastructure so I think by

964
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:31,279
that you mean on trim like sort of an

965
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:35,759
enterprise's at the application though

966
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:38,400
yeah so so yeah yeah you're gonna have

967
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,920
to break for lunch okay so if you have

968
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,410
like other like questions or comments

969
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,110
josh is gonna be here parked for the

970
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:48,120
stage however long you want but for the

971
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,220
rest of the folks lunch is actually

972
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,109
being served and a one hour like work

973
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,839
shopping at a head start and not stand

974
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,790
in line so you can just go break for

975
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,640
lunch josh is gonna be here so please

976
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,890
don't feel obliged to stay okay thank

977
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:06,489
you thank you

978
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:06,489
[Applause]
