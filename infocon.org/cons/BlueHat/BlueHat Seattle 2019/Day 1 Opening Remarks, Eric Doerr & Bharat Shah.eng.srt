that's an applause thing I for those

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,309
Washingtonians I you know there's a

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,339
little bit of East Side West Side

14
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:58,140
rivalry between the Redman side and the

15
00:00:54,339 --> 00:01:00,760
Seattle side this is the good side it

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,000
happens to be where I live but that's a

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,100
coincidence so thanks for coming to this

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,750
awesome venue and a big shout out to the

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,399
team that pulled this together because I

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:16,210
think it's a ton of work that goes into

21
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:19,090
this so I want to talk a little bit you

22
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,190
might wonder who the heck's here who are

23
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,130
you if you don't really know who you are

24
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,630
I can't help you but I thought it'd be

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,539
good to tell a little bit of the stats

26
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,810
we've 1100 of the best in the security

27
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,740
industry here thank you for coming and

28
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,299
making the time we have researchers

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,158
people work in cyber defense in

30
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:42,579
governments and corporations people who

31
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:46,299
build security products it's awesome

32
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:47,679
we've changed a little blue hat a little

33
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,719
bit in a couple of ways and one of the

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,360
things we realized is that the nature of

35
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,919
threats is changing we still love

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,869
security research we love

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,020
vulnerabilities or we love finding and

38
00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:00,579
fixing vulnerabilities but but that we

39
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,990
live in a more complicated world where

40
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,490
we need analysts and people who do

41
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,859
intelligence and people who build these

42
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,199
products and and we wanted to have this

43
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:10,060
be a bigger event a little bit of a

44
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,790
broader event and get hear from more

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,320
voices about what they're learning and

46
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,070
what they're struggling with in security

47
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,680
so thank you for coming I each year we

48
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,590
recognize top researchers we have five

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,329
of the top 75 that we recognized a

50
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,799
couple of months ago who are in the

51
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:30,180
audience one of whom speaking next

52
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:32,290
tomorrow I think so that's very exciting

53
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,989
obviously we work with thousands of

54
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,160
researchers every year the vast majority

55
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,480
of whom work

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,410
with us out of the goodness of their

57
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,959
heart because they want to make the

58
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,280
world a better place a few of them work

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,890
with us because we give them an

60
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,520
occasional cash award to put it in

61
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,730
perspective

62
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,070
last year we distributed 4.4 million

63
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,679
dollars in bounty Awards for the

64
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,790
incredible partnerships that we have

65
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,380
helping protect our customers and make

66
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:04,570
our products better so thank you for

67
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:07,329

68
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,280

69
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,230
active protections program I hope I got

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,600
the acronym right there basically people

71
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,000
who work on security products ad

72
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,799
products etc around the world and work

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,750
with us to help make sure that when we

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,520
find something that the extended

75
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,920
community comes together and makes the

76
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,860
world a safer place and so a huge huge

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,649
shout out to them

78
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,510
you might wonder why are you here and of

79
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,750
course everyone has their own why I want

80
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:38,560
to tell you my why I I'm here because

81
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,330
I'm pissed off and I'm pissed off at

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,020
what's happening in the world because

83
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,520
it's not right and I'm proud to work at

84
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,010
a company that's willing to take some

85
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,530
risks to make the world a little bit

86
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,000
better and lots of people make risks I

87
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,200
don't mean we're unique in that way or

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,400
take risks but this is something we've

89
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,549
been doing for the last couple of years

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,010
is we have teams of people who try to

91
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,200
track the major apts and when we see

92
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,019
them attacking customers we tell the

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,720
customers that this is happening for the

94
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,690
first time this summer we shared the

95
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,130
volume that we're doing that and you

96
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,200
know in the previous year this was in

97
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,079
July I think that we posted this we

98
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,488
delivered 10,000 nation-state

99
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,190
notifications so this is basically

100
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:25,950
saying to someone you were either

101
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,150
targeted maybe unsuccessfully or

102
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,900
successfully compromised by nation-state

103
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,640
and this is average citizens this is

104
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,580
government entities

105
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,270
this is corporations this is journalist

106
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,580
this is activists it is it is unbounded

107
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,919
and we live in a world right now where

108
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,159
things are unbounded and that's not okay

109
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,558
and I wake up in the morning and I'm mad

110
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,689
because

111
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:53,789
it's not right that the world is

112
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:58,019
becoming a less safe place with

113
00:04:53,789 --> 00:05:02,009
technology and yet I'm inspired because

114
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:05,459
we have the power we don't have to wait

115
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:07,949
on the world policing itself we have the

116
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:11,009
power to make the technology better we

117
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:13,439
have the power to influence policy we

118
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,509
have the power to hunt the criminals and

119
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,439
we have the power to make things better

120
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:24,719
and every day I try to make things just

121
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:29,369
a little bit better a couple of weeks

122
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:33,659
ago we shared that we found the first

123
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:35,129
sign we've seen of active tampering with

124
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:40,438
the u.s. election or attempts to

125
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:44,729
actively tamper it's not okay this is my

126
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:48,929
wife I want this to not exist I want

127
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:50,669
this to stop and for me blue hat is one

128
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:53,458
of the small steps we take as a

129
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,929
community of course there are many to

130
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,589
make it better the stakes have never

131
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,448
been higher

132
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,269
for us to come together and share

133
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:02,399
techniques and partner and challenge

134
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:04,199
each other to be better because

135
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,909
collectively we're defending the world

136
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:11,549
and and I want us to continue making the

137
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:13,469
world a safer place so thank you for

138
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:15,748
coming a couple of days is a lot of time

139
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:18,539
to spend thank you for coming thank you

140
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:20,519
for helping today tomorrow and

141
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,619
throughout the year because most of the

142
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,939
people in this room are part of a

143
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:25,349
tremendous partnership that helped us

144
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,709
make things better so thank you very

145
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,709

so be nice to him and he's gonna talk a

150
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,969
little bit about the digital

151
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:51,460
transformation that we're seeing that's

152
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:57,350
underway thank you Eric

153
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:59,960
good morning and a huge welcome thanks

154
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:04,670
for taking the time and joining us to

155
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:07,609
our new reshaped blue hat 2019 it kind

156
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,890
of mirrors the evolution of our thinking

157
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,470
and so I'm really excited to have not

158
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:15,020
only a tremendous amount of outside

159
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:23,560
participation but an excellent set of

160
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:26,120
speakers who are gonna join us okay so

161
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,110
not that you don't know this but I just

162
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,780
want to kind of reiterate what we see

163
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:36,800
software is being infused in every facet

164
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:40,809
of every organization every startup

165
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:44,680
every corporate organization you know

166
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:47,960
organizations are using software to

167
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,570
reinvent their internal operation

168
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,560
processes rebuilding their products and

169
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:57,920
services even in improving their

170
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,130
employee experiences work experiences so

171
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:05,000
software is really really really driving

172
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:08,090
a whole new set of innovation this is

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,500
actually the most exciting part for me

174
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,750
in spite of the fact that I've been

175
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,050
around in the industry for a long time

176
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:20,090
it is being used in every facet by every

177
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:22,460
organization to create new value it does

178
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:26,390
mean a ton more software and it does

179
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,950
mean a lot more software developers it's

180
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,070
almost in the it's almost

181
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:35,150
indistinguishable whether a company like

182
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:37,729
Tesla is a automative company or a

183
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:42,079
software company automotive industry

184
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,410
hires about 1% software engineers Tesla

185
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,750
is almost 7

186
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,850
take Netflix is it really an

187
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,490
entertainment company or really a

188
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,430
software and a services company very

189
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,980
pervasive user software and that's just

190
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:00,540
kind of taking over Andrew and over the

191
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:03,930
world I'm an engineer I like to write

192
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,430
software but this isn't about people not

193
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:09,839
having anything else to do in writing

194
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:12,599
software software is being used across

195
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,920
the whole gamut of industries and

196
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,040
industry verticals to drive new economic

197
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,189
value without these changes and the new

198
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,959
competitive edge that software gets

199
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,510
people will probably become irrelevant

200
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,840
organization will become irrelevant so

201
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,700
it really is driving a tremendous new

202
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,890
economic value and digital

203
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:40,020
transformation is actually the one of

204
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:44,069
the biggest economic imperatives the

205
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,199
cloud is clearly the catalyst gone are

206
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,360
the days where you order tons of

207
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,360
hardware and wait for it to be delivered

208
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,360
and hire people to patch and run it

209
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,220
cloud is really really facilitating this

210
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:03,560
this digital transformation in

211
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:06,750
tremendously interesting new ways and I

212
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,150
started my my last four and a half five

213
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,840
years I started on this journey with a

214
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:17,160
singular focus to help customers embrace

215
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:20,130
cloud to build trust and security so

216
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,930
that cloud is not a real blocker but

217
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,920
they can embrace cloud help them

218
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:29,069
embracing cloud with security

219
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,709
enhancements however over the last two

220
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,200
years I have fundamentally changed my

221
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:37,500
position and I fundamentally believe

222
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,000
that cloud is perhaps cloud and digital

223
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,180
transformation both are a

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,930
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to really

225
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:49,469
improve the security for a for almost

226
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,810
everybody in the world and how how did

227
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,780
that first of all we talked about cloud

228
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,319
effects if you are if organizations are

229
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,610
on their own

230
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,580
at least the vast majority of

231
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:04,030
organizations they're very likely to be

232
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,100
patient zero of an attack in the cloud

233
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,300
most cloud vendors and Microsoft of

234
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,420
course being one of them

235
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,790
we actually synthesized and once we

236
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,969
detect something we rush out and protect

237
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:18,280
all the tenants in the cloud huge power

238
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,190
that cloud brings in addition to large

239
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,550
amounts of computing and processing

240
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:27,490
power and data to actually help process

241
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,310
threats really really fast but it also

242
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:33,430
is a real digital transmission the other

243
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,859
big catalyst people have were old suffer

244
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,790
90 to 95 percent of the hacks depending

245
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,890
on what report you read have a

246
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:46,480
fundamental source which Saphir written

247
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:48,400
for the parameterize world you know

248
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,670
nobody would rewrite the software but

249
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,579
this ability to drive new economic value

250
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,939
is helping customers rewrite the

251
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,910
software to this new cloud paradigm that

252
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,040
will again be another source of huge

253
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,939
asset for us from a security point of

254
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,370
view and and this is where I think we

255
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,300
together you and us and other

256
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,860
like-minded people can help customers

257
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,280
get get this thing right they're not

258
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,170
gonna get it right if you just let them

259
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,930
if you don't really help them so this is

260
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:26,349
a huge kind of opportunity for us to

261
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:31,239
kind of go change to make the world a

262
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:32,980
lot better cloud also the digital

263
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,720
transformation and cloud also brings on

264
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,940
new challenges applications are being

265
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,730
rewritten by thousands and thousands of

266
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:47,950
people and and and you know it's just

267
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:51,010
pervasively entering all facets of our

268
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:53,320
life it actually has the potential if

269
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,750
not done right to really increase the

270
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,870
surface area so the new applications

271
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,690
being written is probably a challenge

272
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:05,170
and an opportunity for us supply chain

273
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,840
is a huge huge challenge and an

274
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,760
opportunity right from hardware to

275
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,670
software and the

276
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,480
use of OSS in many many ways even though

277
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:19,060
it is really really empowering engineers

278
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,520
all over the world to even human

279
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,099
elements depending on a vendor to do

280
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,680
work for you to even service level

281
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,910
dependencies are all new challenges that

282
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:34,260
our organizations have to deal with IOT

283
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:37,959
IOT is fundamentally changing changing

284
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,510
lots and lots of facets of our lives but

285
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,840
it also adds tremendous new surface area

286
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:46,360
it also actually blends digital and the

287
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,790
physical world that has another set of

288
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,790
challenges and of course data and

289
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,490
privacy the whole digital transformation

290
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:58,240
one of the key elements of that is data

291
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,490
data to drive new insights to have

292
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,990
better customer relationships to

293
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,160
actually make your products and services

294
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:09,370
better but data if not handled very well

295
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,660
in this world or increasing regulation

296
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:16,780
is a big challenge for our organization

297
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,670
so I again go back and say the the

298
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,250
digital transformation and the cloud

299
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,849
transformation are tremendous new

300
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,640
opportunities for us to improve the

301
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,700
security of the world even as it drives

302
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,069
new economic value and this is kind of

303
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,130
the reason why I am super excited to be

304
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:40,780
part of this conference really excited

305
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:44,890
to have all of us here because this is

306
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:48,000
our opportunity this is our opportunity

307
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:51,370
and our responsibility to work together

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,930
to really help customers go through this

309
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,480
digital transformation cloud

310
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:59,160
transformation and actually make the

311
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,630
world better we have to work on

312
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,780
partnerships like this and conferences

313
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,700
like this for years but I want to take

314
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,560
two examples that in spite of all the

315
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,650
work we have done two examples of what

316
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,520
we could do even more

317
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:17,800
let's take example one I and I see this

318
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,040
quite often I read about it quite often

319
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,990
when somebody has a breach or a

320
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,800
potential attack

321
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:29,490
we all kind of go to our silos and kinda

322
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,349
hide what happened there is no sharing

323
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:35,500
nobody knows exactly how somebody got in

324
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,030
it's all word of mouth or or you hear

325
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,550
about it or you read about it but

326
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:43,060
there's no real sharing of what happened

327
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:47,410
how did they evict the adversary how did

328
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:51,790
they prevent another attack etc this

329
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:55,569
just perpetuates the problem by orders

330
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,520
of magnitude the adversary has thousands

331
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,200
and thousands of other targets that they

332
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:05,140
keep using the same MO without any real

333
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:08,230
stoppage and and and I think this is

334
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,390
something we at Microsoft are really

335
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,750
really excited and striving and and

336
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:16,930
would let want to work with you all to

337
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:21,430
change with Sentinel we really want to

338
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:24,099
take this to a place where we allow this

339
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,410
kind of sharing to happen share the

340
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,570
detection share have you evicted share

341
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,939
how you actually would prevent things

342
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,610
happen and we do think that this is an

343
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,040
area where the industry needs to

344
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,270
actually step out of feeling like they

345
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,880
did something wrong of course some

346
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:43,090
people are negligent but for a lot of

347
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,130
them they're just pure victims we have

348
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:48,130
to kind of get ahead of it share our

349
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,590
findings and make sure the 10,000 and

350
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:53,650
20,000 others don't get hacked

351
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:57,250
as easily so that's kind of one let's

352
00:16:53,650 --> 00:17:00,699
look at the second thing you know 90 to

353
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:03,610
95 percent of all projects today use

354
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:08,410
Oasis I think that is a fantastic

355
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:12,250
example of how sharing has actually been

356
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:14,650
used to help others it's such a powerful

357
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,450
concept I mean I keep saying cloud is

358
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,440
the catalyst for digital transformation

359
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:22,900
but really OSS and the way people shared

360
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,150
they will appreciate their their code

361
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,970
and how people take dependencies and

362
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:30,670
others other people's code is actually

363
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,740
the heartbeat as well of digital

364
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:36,670
transformation that is actually what is

365
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,280
powering people driving new economic

366
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,700
a really great piece it's such a

367
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,080
powerful concept right I think we need

368
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:49,810
something like that to actually bring

369
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,710
security savviness democratizing that

370
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:55,090
allowing people to share what they've

371
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,910
experienced share what they've learned

372
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,820
and make sure thousands and thousands of

373
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:04,510
others benefit from that again with

374
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:08,800
github we are super excited to actually

375
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:11,260
make security a fundamental part of our

376
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,570
developer community you see more of this

377
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,580
happening but we are already on this

378
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:19,149
journey where we think this vibrant

379
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,730
ecosystem of developers can benefit from

380
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:25,200
each other right get their applications

381
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:28,480
written in a much more secure manner and

382
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,570
this community that they have 40 million

383
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,830
plus a developers if we can democratize

384
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:38,679
all the great security techniques we are

385
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,810
developing together and even share some

386
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,960
of the pitfalls that we have we

387
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:47,379
absolutely can make this this world

388
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,100
better so I am super excited to be on

389
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:53,890
this journey I am really looking forward

390
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:57,100
to this two days of conference it's just

391
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:59,440
the beginning of a reshaped blue hat we

392
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,379
want to work with you and I know that we

393
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,850
have some good talent we have you spend

394
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,130
a lot of money they've got lots of

395
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,100
things going but I will tell you that we

396
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:13,240
as Microsoft cannot do this alone

397
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,300
we absolutely need you to wait to lean

398
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,810
in and help us we do have a wide range

399
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,639
set of customers we also need them to

400
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:24,370
kind of take this thing take this

401
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,640
digital transformation in the right

402
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:30,969
direction but by getting security right

403
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,400
and together I'm sure we will make this

404
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,140
thing better so with that I again want

405
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,380
to take this opportunity and thank you

406
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,570
thank you all of the participants to be

407
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,150
coming here and I hope you have an

408
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,790
excellent two days here and you're with

409
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:48,470
us on this journey to better secure

410
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,530
world thank you

411
