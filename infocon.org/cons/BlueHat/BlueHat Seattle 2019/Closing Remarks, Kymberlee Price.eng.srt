[Music]

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,939
thank you all so much for coming to our

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,040
first blue hat Seattle Wow Ryan it's not

6
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,830
kidding it did kind of thin out a little

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,630
bit but you guys stayed to the end and

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,880
for that I think there's an achievement

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,380
unlocked with the Xbox speaker yesterday

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,640
is going to make sure it shows up on all

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:37,430
your consoles so I won't stand too long

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,370
between you and happy hour but I I want

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,460
to start with asking everybody to give

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,860
it up for the speakers and the trainer's

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,990
who have given so much of their time and

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,970
expertise because it's not just getting

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,770
on stage or getting up and delivering a

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,449
workshop it's all the prep work that

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,550
goes into it and their willingness to

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,550
come share that with us so please

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,620
I'd also like to recognize the content

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,020
advisory board this was our first year

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,260
for Seattle having a Content advisory

24
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,330
board with both internal and external

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,700
advisors and I think it really paid off

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:28,070
I think the content was pretty good so

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:31,580

28
