1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,740
let's get going with the next set of

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,569
exciting talks here

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,760
my name is swarupa de la Polly I'm a

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,450
security program manager in CNA I

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,580
security I'm honored to introduce the

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,180
next speaker John hosts

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,430
he's flew here all the way from London

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,830
he runs the detect function at photo box

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,198
group which covers security operations

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,019
Incident Response and Red Team testing

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,029
he also leads the security innovation

12
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,699
hub running projects to evaluate

13
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:35,460
technologies and processes that support

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,530
data inform decision-making process

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,070
automation and a DevOps engineering

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,510
culture it's all yours John hello

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,660
everyone thank very much

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,789
so I am here today speaking on my own

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,250
behalf not that of the company that I

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,840
work for we are going to jump fast into

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,059
some very philosophical territory

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
because I have recently been thinking

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,059
about a disconnect

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,730
it's the disconnect between reading

25
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,919
things like this and thinking yes that

26
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,989
is definitely where we should be however

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,549
if we're honest with ourselves very

28
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,080
often perhaps we find ourselves

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,180
somewhere that's slightly more like this

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,408
now I think directionally we know in

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,240
security that we're doing the right

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,890
things so clearly

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,539
we shouldn't be changing the game but I

34
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,850
do think we have some work in security

35
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,740
to understand what the games are

36
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,130
understand where we should be playing

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,679
what game and when so how should we

38
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,390
think about that problem well I propose

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,759
to you that everyone is a security

40
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,460
architect it's just that not everyone

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,960
knows it which means if like me you work

42
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,139
in the space of detect respond recover

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,689
you are about as far downstream as it

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,570
gets of conscious and unconscious

45
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,908
architecture decisions but architecture

46
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,740
of what you ask I would answer that the

47
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,439
colour is in quotes like this from Dave

48
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,079
I tell which is the system of systems

49
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,758
that we find ourselves in and I have as

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,798
I've worked in security come to think of

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,710
the the web of security controls we work

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,320
as a complex system operating in a

53
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,719
complex system this is a talk about how

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,449
data can help us about why graphs are

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,849
absolutely necessary but perhaps why

56
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,560
they are necessary but not sufficient

57
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,380
until we over

58
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,140
on two maps that help us understand our

59
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:24,209
terrain specifically so that we can

60
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,640
begin to answer questions like this so

61
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:29,340
what is the mission that we have as

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,559
security professionals well the best

63
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,660
articulation I found of it is to strike

64
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,970
a balance for our organization between

65
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,459
protection and spend and in order to do

66
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,380
that I would argue in order to achieve

67
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,390
that balance we need to understand the

68
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,310
terrain we're in understand activity

69
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,410
across it understand adversary

70
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,739
opportunity within it and then figure

71
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,180
out based on all those factors what are

72
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,709
the things that we're going to have to

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,350
deal with as we begin to strike that

74
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,150
balance here are a few of them that I

75
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,250
wrote down but the deal is that these

76
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,769
are changing all the time so while it's

77
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,940
very easy to draw something like this

78
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:04,350
that shows a lovely level of protection

79
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,489
increasing as the spend goes up at the

80
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,109
beginning as we begin to put a security

81
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,120
program plays and there begins to fall

82
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,069
down in a nice curve the reality is that

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,470
means getting our security control

84
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,600
implementation correct over every single

85
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,150
control we put in place its entire

86
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,739
lifespan the particular portfolio of

87
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,049
controls that we've decided to implement

88
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,540
ie where we put our money and of course

89
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,519
how those controls work together as

90
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,359
feedback loops to provide the result

91
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,840
that we're after

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,570
so if we want to reach that worthy

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,950
destination what are we going to rely on

94
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:41,100
for the job of the reaching I think it's

95
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,280
how we translate our understanding into

96
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,900
choices that drive decisions and actions

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,790
and here are some of the questions we

98
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,680
need to answer as we do that where do we

99
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,328
place our resources on our field in what

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,190
pattern how do we direct their effort

101
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,500
why here not there why in this direction

102
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,820
not that why this much not less now even

103
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,799
just talking through those questions

104
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,350
it's fairly obvious that we can't answer

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,870
them by using a spreadsheet which is why

106
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,329
we end up with Excel macro mirror mazes

107
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,769
of spreadsheets joined together which is

108
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,140
essentially a graph that we have built

109
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,180
and then filtered through applying our

110
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,670
mental model of understanding and if we

111
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,798
think about what that process really

112
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,500
would be if we kind of wrote it down I

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,478
think it would look something like this

114
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,520
data captures information tables

115
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,289
knowledge graphs understanding maps and

116
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
wisdom filters and there's a sense that

117
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,259
it should get easier

118
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,599
the things we're trying to achieve as we

119
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,039
go up this this chain I didn't write

120
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:34,560
this this was actually taken for my

121
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,659
friend Dan who also added that the

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,250
future perhaps is owned by cartographers

123
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:40,110
who can navigate maps and replace

124
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,900
refined paths through them by filtering

125
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,190
so what is a visual metaphor for that

126
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,859
well this is the best one I found this

127
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,990
is citymapper sorry a hill mapper from

128
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,550
San Francisco it gives you your location

129
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,110
it tells you the Ralphs gradient of the

130
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,310
hills based on your location and you can

131
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,750
then select right well if I want to get

132
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,680
from A to B here's the wisest way of

133
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,030
doing it and obviously if you're a

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,009
cyclist you know that's the very handy

135
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,659
things do it in San Francisco so there

136
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:01,919
are some explicit things that we can

137
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:03,780
probably take away when we look at that

138
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,340
map well it's obviously going to be

139
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,869
harder or easier to do certain things in

140
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,359
certain terrains just because of the

141
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,699
terrain it's obviously going to be a

142
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,069
hard or easier based on our position in

143
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,800
that terrain but there are also implicit

144
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:19,139
things about terrain which is what are

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,789
the forces that act upon them who

146
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,860
controls that terrain how do they

147
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,449
perceive it what are their concerns and

148
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,240
pressures how are they making decisions

149
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,849
what actions are they taking and how is

150
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,440
that changing all the things we need to

151
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:33,990
understand to implement the best

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,690
portfolio of controls that we can so

153
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,340
coming back to perhaps rather depressing

154
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,289
lives if we're not you know gifted with

155
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,638
working in a wonderful organization that

156
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,990
just gets it and you know all the

157
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,949
controls are effortlessly implemented

158
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,870
and there's absolutely no technical

159
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:47,550
problems at all and coming back to what

160
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,250
that may mean if we're running detection

161
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,870
and response I think there's another

162
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,340
question that we haven't yet asked

163
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,840
ourselves as an industry which is what

164
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,849
are the range of forces that we are at

165
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,609
the mercy of can influence one can

166
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:01,169
conjure and in my work so far I've come

167
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,840
to think of there the forces of three

168
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,490
tectonics weather patterns and micro

169
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,830
climates obviously these will have

170
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,150
different scales of change and they will

171
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,560
have different predict abilities of

172
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,568
change which is why you should not make

173
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:18,449
tectonic decisions on a golf course so

174
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:21,569
if we are waiting to drive change in our

175
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,310
business do we as Milton Friedman once

176
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,139
suggested wait until the politically

177
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,880
impossible becomes the politically

178
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,590
inevitable and be there with that plan

179
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,360
for when the bad thing happens well I

180
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,580
would suggest that that is reactive and

181
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,620
we want to be proactive and if we want

182
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,789
to be proactive what are some of the

183
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,099
ways that we should be thinking about

184
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,300
the problem that can help us so there is

185
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,900
a presentation that I want to write

186
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,580
called

187
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,780
should never quote the art of war unless

188
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,039
you have read the art of war and

189
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,599
unfortunately that is not this

190
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,460
presentation but I promise you I have

191
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,289
read it and I'm just going to pull out a

192
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,820
few quotes from it that I think are

193
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,590
helpful metaphors for us to think

194
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,060
through so what the art of war tells us

195
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,289
will suggest to us is that there are

196
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,250
flows of forces and shifting

197
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,190
configurations

198
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,620
changing patterns right it tells us that

199
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,270
if we can see the simple things in those

200
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,460
patterns we can change the whole

201
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,139
configuration very easily so if we can

202
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,659
understand patterns we can harness them

203
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,090
and it tells us that if we're ready

204
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,130
change can still happen super quickly

205
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,530
and he doesn't have to cause chaos and

206
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,199
don't have to wait for chaos and if we

207
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,630
think about what graphs are to our

208
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,970
industry I would propose that graphs are

209
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:26,520
essentially the bridge between being

210
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:29,550
able to be reactive and being able to be

211
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,740
proactive and that's because they offer

212
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,650
a scalable way for us to structure

213
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,199
connect identify and share patterns with

214
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,508
each other both about the environments

215
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,000
we work in but also about the attacks we

216
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:44,520
face and the patterns we're seeing so

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,610
this is kind of a follow-on presentation

218
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,169
to a presentation we did besides we

219
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,090
presented an ontology here of the

220
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,159
components we were basically trying to

221
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,599
take all of this stuff which is a list

222
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,490
of the stuff we wanted to put in a graph

223
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:00,180
and all the various metadata associated

224
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:02,669
with it and we were trying to codify how

225
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,830
to link data in the business and

226
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:07,020
technical dimension to identify patterns

227
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,430
better for ourselves right so all of

228
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,409
this thinking has come out of

229
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,970
operational requirement to solve a

230
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,949
problem so it's not academic in that

231
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,270
sense and if you want to have a look at

232
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:17,250
some of the ontology is there on github

233
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,979
here which explains kind of the the

234
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,270
nodes and the edges and the nouns and

235
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,940
the verbs that we use to build up that

236
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,430
ontology and what that did was it

237
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,830
allowed us to effectively capture our

238
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,330
terrain begin capturing it and it

239
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,370
allowed us to begin to understand

240
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,449
influencing factors within our terrain

241
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,190
about decisions that were being made

242
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,919
about business projects about business

243
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,380
change what it didn't allow us to do was

244
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,750
to understand the merits of moving in a

245
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,010
particular direction

246
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,890
choosing the patterns that we wanted to

247
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,829
implement and so something that I feel

248
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,020
is an untapped area of where graphs can

249
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:53,819
help is patterns of play right so a

250
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,560
question that I asked myself

251
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,270
very often is well how do I reduce

252
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,040
adverse REO opportunity in the terrain

253
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,480
with the greatest efficacy right it's

254
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,310
not a question that keeps me up at night

255
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,940
but it is what I choose to sit up at

256
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,130
night working and so let's assume that

257
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,300
we've done a basic threat model process

258
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,100
like the one that Chris Hoffman Phil

259
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,089
Venables talked about here if you see

260
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,030
this work on to and let's assume that

261
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,500
we've decided that we're going to act

262
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,060
effectively we're hoping to reduce

263
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,720
exposure to unacceptable impact right

264
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,030
that's kind of our job

265
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
stop impact deliver protection and if we

266
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,329
think very simplistically about what

267
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,680
we're doing when we do that we're

268
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,330
probably taking things that are

269
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,010
interesting to the attacker and easy to

270
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,900
compromise and moving them from one

271
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,800
point of this quadrant to another simple

272
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:37,470
enough so far so recognize one to n

273
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,209
patterns implement one to n patters now

274
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,830
generic of the terrain we've already

275
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,840
talked about a few things that are going

276
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:46,620
to determine your success when you do

277
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,940
that however one of the ones that I've

278
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,590
been thinking through recently is the

279
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,380
game space in which we choose to counter

280
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:55,050
address the opportunity so how do we

281
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,060
reason through typically the patterns

282
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,180
that we apply to our environment to

283
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,650
achieve the result we want at best cost

284
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,239
and also you know something that I also

285
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,160
find challenging in this industry is we

286
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,330
don't have a good way yet other than by

287
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,550
creating slide decks that are the

288
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,500
hundred slides long to present the

289
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,660
models we have in our head to our execs

290
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,400
to our colleagues who are being asked on

291
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,230
top of all their other responsibilities

292
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,819
to now consider a threat in your

293
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,380
environment it's like well hey you know

294
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,150
I'm a software engineer under CEO like

295
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,740
that's why I have you there for right so

296
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,390
we need to expose the patterns that are

297
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,680
available to our colleagues and the

298
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,180
choices and the costs and the

299
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,890
implications of those because if we

300
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,750
can't we look like a black box that goes

301
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,430
hey we should put in this EDR solution

302
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,920
which literally no it's fantastic so

303
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,060
here's a simple way that I've kind of

304
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,510
been walking through this that I wanted

305
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,640
to share

306
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,290
let's take you know basic attack out

307
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,520
motivation right very simplistic level I

308
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,410
know that nation-states have different

309
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,640
motivations this is an incomplete model

310
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,310
but it begins to help us think through

311
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,720
it let's take the concept of at every

312
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,400
different layer of attacker there are

313
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,140
different layers of sophistication those

314
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,569
attackers have differs to different

315
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,790
TTP's and then let's take the concept of

316
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,320
not attack surfaces but threat exposures

317
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,060
so those actors can reach different

318
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,110
exposures it's not going to be possible

319
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,939
for a script kiddie to jump on a plane

320
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,020
go to another office in another country

321
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,100
and break into it whereas that will

322
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,720
perhaps be possible for a nation-state

323
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,120
just as a thought exercise

324
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
so if we combine these models together

325
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,270
what we get is something like this we

326
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,960
get level of sophistication going down

327
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,850
the the x-axis x-axis attack surfaces on

328
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,750
the y-axis and we begin to understand

329
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,950
right what is our level of

330
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,180
sophistication for example what is the

331
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,430
where's the place that we feel is

332
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,109
defensible where do we want to get to

333
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,219
with our level of protection and using

334
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,470
something like soon we'll use cyber

335
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,330
defense matrix we can peer inside a

336
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,190
specific threat exposure and say what

337
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,230
controls are doing what across the

338
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,380
various layers of access network devices

339
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,970
apps etc etc and how is that patent

340
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,170
moving in relation to the keenest

341
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,380
pillars of identify protect attack

342
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,300
respond recover and we can also start

343
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,650
questioning perhaps the efficacy with

344
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,089
which those controls are achieving that

345
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,959
result for example if there's a huge

346
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,370
amount of waste we might look at

347
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,660
repurposing spend onto another control

348
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,680
another threat exposure if there's

349
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,939
something that looks great but needs to

350
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,620
be optimized how would we do that and

351
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,450
our our controls focused on the right

352
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,890
areas across the cyber defense matrix

353
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,030
for the threat profile we have this is

354
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,400
the job of threat modeling to give us

355
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,860
that information but basically what we

356
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,050
get to at the end of this is efficacy in

357
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,870
relation to a range of possible options

358
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,370
and the best way that I found recently

359
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,430
to think through what those are is this

360
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,770
so this is game from Sunil you hear it

361
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,329
describes vectors exploits attack

362
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,829
surface and vulnerabilities as different

363
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,320
game spaces although that terminology is

364
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,880
minor not his and he describes the rate

365
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,470
of change across these different areas

366
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,850
so attack vectors changed very

367
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,470
infrequently but when they do they

368
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,360
destroy entire control configuration

369
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,650
patterns vulnerabilities change much

370
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,820
more regularly but the control patterns

371
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,420
you can use to control them are much

372
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,180
more stable

373
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:39,689
so the example he uses imagine a prison

374
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,219
where the vector is aerial attack so you

375
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,680
can kind of you know fly a helicopter to

376
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,330
Alcatraz for example the exploit would

377
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,040
be the helicopter that's the thing that

378
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,290
allows the attacker to get there

379
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,730
the attack surface is all the places

380
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,750
they could land that helicopter and the

381
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,950
vulnerability is where they choose to

382
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,089
land that helicopter to achieve their

383
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,650
objective to extract the person they

384
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:57,240
want to get out now an example of a

385
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,829
change in a vector would be drones so

386
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,480
drones would collapse the model they're

387
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,710
a prison like Alcatraz may have built to

388
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,730
protect against aerial attack for

389
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,270
example so that's kind of the rough

390
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,940
rough thinkI framework so if we combine

391
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,530
that dimensionality with the cyber

392
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,900
defense matrix and we think of it as a

393
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,390
3d space and we think of the various

394
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,579
efficacy that we face if we can protect

395
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,650
against the vector vs. protecting

396
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,579
against the vulnerability what we begin

397
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,589
to understand is

398
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,758
actually our controls and the patterns

399
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,679
that we can put in all these different

400
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,600
thread exposures can be wildly different

401
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,119
and multitudinous there's clearly

402
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,649
clearly a lot of them not only that but

403
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:34,220
the way that we apply them to an

404
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:36,449
upstream threat exposure like our entire

405
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,980
external Internet surface is going to

406
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,839
have a knock-on effect if we don't apply

407
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,920
them correctly to the internal surface

408
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,649
so I want to kind of give a quick

409
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,689
thought experiment here let's take this

410
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:50,759
picture and let's say that we move the

411
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:52,920
things that are interesting and easy to

412
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,819
compromise over - interesting because we

413
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,769
can't change where the attack is

414
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:58,019
interested in there is a model that we

415
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:00,149
can really downtime to go into that and

416
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,350
what we end up with is this so one of

417
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:02,429
two things is going to happen right the

418
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,929
attacker is going to change what they're

419
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:05,160
interested in to achieve their objective

420
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:07,679
or they're going to have to just work

421
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,600
harder to effectively compromise those

422
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,988
things that we have made less easy to

423
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,730
compromise right so depending on how we

424
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:16,379
choose is a business to implement

425
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,720
controls and the scale of our business

426
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:21,779
and the attackers we work with how could

427
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,939
your actions change how good everyone's

428
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,369
addresses are not to answer now just

429
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:28,829
think about how could the actions of

430
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:30,389
others change how good your adversary's

431
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:33,179
are or what they're interested in and

432
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:37,110
how could threat actors just change what

433
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:39,139
they're interested in so when we think

434
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,910
about things like the release of

435
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,259
government built tools and the

436
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,360
availability of script kiddies when we

437
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:46,860
think about the fact that some

438
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,299
organizations were very good at counter

439
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,119
fraud back in the early econ days were

440
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:52,889
effectively training up attackers at a

441
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:54,209
speed that the rest of the industry

442
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:56,160
could not keep up with and therefore you

443
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:58,049
know effectively collapsing vectors for

444
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,850
those other organizations we need to

445
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:02,459
begin to consider in the wider picture

446
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,860
what is the stability of our control

447
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,209
capability portfolio are we making the

448
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,939
right trade-offs when we're applying

449
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:10,829
patterns what fast and so cycle changes

450
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:13,379
are we ready for and are we happy with

451
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:16,138
all those answers now that is not a

452
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:19,499
Rubik's Cube that is playing 50 games of

453
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,419
chess concurrently where every change on

454
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:22,619
one board may actually influence the

455
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,790
patterns on the other board so when you

456
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:28,649
go back to them they're no longer the

457
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:31,289
same and that's a complex space and yet

458
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:31,919
what we have to work with solve this

459
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:34,410
problem

460
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,810
is the risk of Tron that generates

461
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,430
amber green thoughtful dashboards I

462
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,709
literally do not know how the product

463
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,839
managers of these companies managed to

464
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:45,000
get away with pie charts and kind of

465
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,889
like weird global things that no analyst

466
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,250
can use and their loads of alerts it's

467
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:52,889
it's very confusing to me and it's more

468
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,870
confusing because of where I find myself

469
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:57,660
in the battle for meaningful timely

470
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,759
insight because if you consider the

471
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,370
fundamental functions maybe of what we

472
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,829
do in these different spaces in NIST

473
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,990
I would argue like if a data system was

474
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:10,439
going to emerge it would have emerged

475
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,600
here but instead you know is where we

476
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:15,899
have this kind of incoming amount of

477
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,579
volume that demands context I have false

478
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:22,560
positive as a service that is what my

479
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,719
solutions deliver to me and I have to

480
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,729
spend most of my time engineering out

481
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,230
and that is only the beginning because

482
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,699
once we've got one of those well that's

483
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,079
not enough surely we should put all

484
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,040
those alerts in an inbox no one knows

485
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,449
where they're from oh well hang on a

486
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,410
minute let's put them all in a sim yeah

487
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:34,680
and still no one knows where they're

488
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,480
from

489
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,859
oh let's buy a nisha analytics vendor

490
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,519
because our sim doesn't work it's

491
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,139
useless

492
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,880
what will build a data lake on open

493
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,380
source isn't that fantastic maybe none

494
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,600
of that's work come join our hunt team

495
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,639
but I do think that that has an

496
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,230
interesting implication because if we

497
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,089
look at the space that hunters are

498
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,579
operating in and the kind of things that

499
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:56,160
they're trying to use a range of tools

500
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,719
for one of which is grass that's not to

501
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,810
say they don't also have to use this in

502
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,779
tables we can ask why are they not

503
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,549
succeeding in surfacing and driving some

504
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,959
of the change that they find through the

505
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:08,309
graphs that they're using and I would

506
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,439
argue it's because in the hunt space

507
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:12,449
very often those graphs have partial

508
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,270
context they're driven from the bottom

509
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:17,100
up and they can't connect the business

510
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,439
and the technical context in a way

511
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,178
that's able to create those changes in

512
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,579
tectonic shifts or in weather patterns

513
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,520
that we're interested in when we think

514
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,780
about applying the most efficient

515
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,789
configuration of controls and winning

516
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,678
the business case to do that and I think

517
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:34,408
that's particularly relevant when we

518
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,419
think about evolution because as phil

519
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:38,039
Venables said in recent tweet a lot of

520
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,929
the stuff that happens to us is entirely

521
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,190
foreseeable it's not some amazing new

522
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,080
vector that comes at us it's the same

523
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,760
stuff that has been coming at us for

524
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,110
ages and indeed it's stuff that we

525
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,440
thought there were controls there to

526
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,330
stop so

527
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,880
when we think about how data science and

528
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,699
graphs and analytics can work with us I

529
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,750
think very often you know when we hear

530
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,429
comments like that we're thinking right

531
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,019
well that's an unexpected outcome in

532
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:02,269
hindsight you know we thought that

533
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,350
something was there that wasn't

534
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:05,760
effectively if we want to go we could

535
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,219
say there's a step in an attack path

536
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,570
that we thought that we would be able to

537
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,010
detect and that we thought we'd be able

538
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,250
to respond to we could ask ourselves

539
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,750
what went wrong and we might say well

540
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,250
let's look at the different layers again

541
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,320
concern oh you have sensors analytics

542
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,880
orchestrators and actuators sensors

543
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,320
effectively an agent analytics for

544
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,730
example some ml Orchestrator two

545
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,490
workflows actuators the thing that do

546
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,409
the blocking order stopping oh my entire

547
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,350
grid has disappeared sorry it's all red

548
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,210
anyway basically so you know we might

549
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,408
say oh well you know if we if we didn't

550
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,669
if we did detect it but we didn't

551
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,929
respond to it that was a that was a

552
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,299
workflow problem right so we had a

553
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:40,950
problem with orchestrators we had a

554
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,240
valid detection perhaps here in this

555
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,380
space we might say well you know the

556
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,789
alert was ignored we did all right

557
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,139
things in the workflow but it's just the

558
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:48,029
action we took at the end that's a

559
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:49,529
problem with our actuator we might say

560
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:50,669
you know that's a successful year

561
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,010
successful detection and workflow but

562
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:54,389
wrong action here a gap or failure in

563
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,490
detection logic right maybe that's what

564
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:59,549
we blame it on and we say that was a

565
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,019
problem with our analytics and here we

566
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:02,850
might say well the reason that we found

567
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,100
this out was post hoc investigations

568
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,480
something else we didn't recognize it we

569
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,189
didn't have the data there was a problem

570
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,019
with our sensors we had a gap in our

571
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,539
data collection architecture our data

572
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:16,110
wasn't available but if you go ask your

573
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:18,149
team why they missed what they missed

574
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,918
and if you're on that team looking at

575
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:21,418
what you miss and thinking about that I

576
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,559
think the answers that we find might be

577
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,000
very different typically they're like

578
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,379
yeah well we were advised by the vendor

579
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,269
to turn the seven stivity of the ml

580
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,850
algorithm down because just generating

581
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:31,200
too many alerts excuse me vendor won't

582
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,610
share their detection logic hey would it

583
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,529
be possible for you to explain why you

584
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,269
know you didn't detect this no we we

585
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:37,980
wouldn't do that it's too secret okay

586
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:41,070
great so you failed and you won't tell

587
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,299
me why it looks innocuous we've seen

588
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,730
this a thousand times that looks normal

589
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:47,220
in our environment and so when we think

590
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,049
about failures at these layers and when

591
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,309
we ask ourselves searching questions

592
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:51,929
about are they invisible or are they

593
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:54,240
known are they silent or are they loud

594
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,700
are they consistent or inconsistent are

595
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,169
they local or global and what layers did

596
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,580
they happen and how can we safeguard

597
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:00,870
against that and wouldn't it be great if

598
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,750
we could do continuous controls

599
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,580
monitoring against our

600
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,350
try environment we have to ask in the

601
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,480
space of data analytics ml and graphs

602
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,000
what are our controls and the answer is

603
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,380
it is a mixture of human and machine and

604
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,240
I would ask the question how do we begin

605
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,970
to put assurance on humans that's not a

606
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,340
simple question to answer so when we

607
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,840
think about Defence data science the

608
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,000
model that I think we should be

609
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,379
following in this is akin to what John

610
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,120
Rawls Paul recommended in the paper a

611
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,470
number of years ago when he says what

612
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,909
I'm interested in is how people navigate

613
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,340
the boundary between themselves and

614
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,500
machines they work with and as we

615
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,240
observe our use of our tools that is a

616
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,800
focus in and of itself and that is the

617
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,420
focus that I am interested in that I'm

618
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,710
trying to use knowledge graphs that

619
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,240
connect the technical and business

620
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,530
perspectives of what we're doing to

621
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,380
better understand what those patterns

622
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,870
are so when you think about that problem

623
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,060
it's very clear that it's not an easy

624
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,500
problem but I do propose now you agree

625
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,940
that it is a problem about human

626
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,400
interaction data science and data

627
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,110
engineering albeit not necessarily a

628
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,850
question just about models from a

629
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,719
technical perspective but models from a

630
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:03,100
human perspective as well so if we think

631
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,220
about what we're trying to connect and

632
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,100
we think about the times that we end up

633
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,630
joining tables together to create graphs

634
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,060
there are essentially graphs and Excel

635
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,040
spreadsheets and we think about what

636
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,860
Hunters usually uncover about why

637
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,750
something got through or the failures

638
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:23,199
that they find in control or or de de

639
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,790
for availability it's clear that they

640
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,320
are beginning to enter a different

641
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,990
problem space right so when you see

642
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,730
technical people using graphs and they

643
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,110
begin to uncover these problems they're

644
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,390
entering a strategic problem space and I

645
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,040
think we are not yet at the point in

646
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,260
security where we're thinking properly

647
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,149
about the use of signals and applying

648
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,640
them to populations to begin to make it

649
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,370
easier for the robotic side of our

650
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,450
analytics to be more effective so I'm

651
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,500
going to spend too long in this and

652
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,790
literally it's going to flash these up

653
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:53,560
but also Paul also wrote a reflection on

654
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:55,300
feedback loops for resilience so these

655
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,280
kind of four lenses of resilience that

656
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,250
we can think about and if you take those

657
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,260
and you think about what that might mean

658
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,060
if we think about the robotic side so

659
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,410
again copied from Sunil you and this is

660
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,580
by no means right I just kind of like

661
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,990
well hey let me put this together just

662
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,330
to demonstrate how I think we should be

663
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,710
thinking we need to understand what

664
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,659
problem space we're living in right how

665
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,929
can we use signals to best affect how do

666
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,580
we

667
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:18,190
partner with them rather than become

668
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,418
slaves to them and the way that I be

669
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,249
thinking about this recently is roughly

670
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:22,809
this so we have signal strength signal

671
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:23,860
urgency and signal similarity these are

672
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,049
the three things that I have to work

673
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,029
with let's just take two of those down

674
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:29,799
engines I would propose that dense

675
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:31,210
signals and strong signal strength puts

676
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,309
us in a bounded problem space there are

677
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,809
also unbounded problem spaces and wicked

678
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,090
if you want the definitions of those

679
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:38,678
here they are what that means is that

680
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,389
across those problem spaces we're going

681
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,070
to be dealing with tactical operational

682
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:43,418
strategic and grants tragic problems all

683
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,889
of these have different time horizons

684
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:46,330
grand strategic is probably you know two

685
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:47,889
or three years strategic is maybe one

686
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,960
year operational a few months and

687
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:52,508
tactical and so on when we think about

688
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,279
the kind of decisions or the kind of

689
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:56,049
movements that decisions in these areas

690
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:57,730
can cause it becomes fairly clear where

691
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,619
tectonics are and the amount of sparse

692
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,940
data and weak signals that we often have

693
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,799
to work with when we're making those

694
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,299
decisions and that helps us understand

695
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,619
where we can be data-driven to use those

696
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:08,440
drive activities where we need to be

697
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:10,658
data informed we need to combine human

698
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,129
and technical models and where we can be

699
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:13,629
data inspired we really just need to

700
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:15,490
look back at the history of how we've

701
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:17,080
used data to be dead driven and data

702
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,850
informed and think about what that means

703
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,860
and we also need to understand what the

704
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,539
appropriate tools probably are in these

705
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:26,709
spaces they're going to help us begin to

706
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:28,869
make decisions so this kind of thing key

707
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,029
framework is saying right we've got

708
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:32,769
signals signals connect things we see

709
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:34,990
that in graphs they suggest

710
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:36,519
relationships between things excellent

711
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,559
point made in earlier presentation there

712
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,610
are answers that we can and can't get by

713
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,749
connecting them we have to become

714
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,649
comfortable with that right sometimes

715
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:43,720
we're not gonna be able to get the

716
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:45,189
answer and we need to think how we use

717
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,320
them those and the tools they need and

718
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,210
tools we need

719
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,279
so signals is a particularly interesting

720
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:54,159
problem especially working in a sock

721
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,080
environment trying to figure out how do

722
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,029
we use alerting as a partner is a very

723
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,769
interesting challenge or how do we use

724
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:02,830
recognition as a partner which is a

725
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:04,450
telecon - in a moment it's easy to

726
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,279
characterize this as a problem between

727
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,570
visibility and recognition well if we

728
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,710
had visibility will be fine we'd get

729
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,100
recognition but it's just not that

730
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,450
simple so the model of thinking that

731
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,939
we're trying to pursue at the moment

732
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:18,460
using both technical kind of you know ml

733
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,919
model graphs and and the ontology z'

734
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,539
that we use to describe the business

735
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,340
environment is signals analytics

736
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:25,359
recognitions workflows in notifications

737
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,610
so let me just give you a quick

738
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,439
walkthrough of how we put those together

739
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,810
signals we typically are going to be

740
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,700
working with sets sequences or structure

741
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,200
of a thing across different time slices

742
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,790
right so that's one fundamental

743
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,770
construct we can use to begin asking

744
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,720
what's the data we have how useful is it

745
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,980
how do we need to join it together what

746
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,160
are the sources we need to see in

747
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,750
concert or individually from an

748
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,760
analytics perspective we're going to ask

749
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,130
what is the type of analytic we need to

750
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,740
over play over some data and what is the

751
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:55,000
platform that is best fit to have that

752
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,060
data written this isn't a question of

753
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,740
Splunk versus Zoomer logic versus XYZ

754
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,419
right this is a question of all of them

755
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,800
have slightly different advantages based

756
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,090
on the thing we're trying to achieve and

757
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,470
ultimately if we're going to

758
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,169
successfully deliver a high fidelity

759
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,420
alert the probability is that we are

760
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,370
going to need multiple multi kind of

761
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,230
stacked detections one on top of the

762
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,169
other across multiple platforms rather

763
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:20,020
than just a or B recognitions

764
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:22,990
what are we recognizing are we using

765
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,970
data to recognize left of boom right of

766
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,740
boom the sooner you talks about or are

767
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,690
we using it to understand those changes

768
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,970
in our environment those changes in the

769
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,380
life in the patterns of life across our

770
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,140
terrain the movement and adversary

771
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,970
opportunity do we have the right level

772
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,400
of zoom so something else I think a lot

773
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,200
about is at the understan level very

774
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,760
often I'm are I'm looking to aggregate I

775
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,740
want to see things in aggregate and then

776
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,480
I want to be able to zoom down to an

777
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,220
individual thing and I want to be able

778
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,690
to understand how that changes my

779
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,400
perception of what the patterns are that

780
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,500
I'm seeing so that I can then go and

781
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,880
achieve balance in the controls that I

782
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,460
implement in the in the patterns that I

783
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,840
implement them and finally workflows so

784
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:07,240
we talk a lot in this industry about

785
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:09,189
high fidelity detections and if we begin

786
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,450
to think about how many of those we

787
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:15,370
actually have from a given tool or

788
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,990
multi-tools it's going to be fairly

789
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,870
clear we've got a lot less high fidelity

790
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,570
detections than we do low unless we're

791
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:25,300
really unlucky and if we think about

792
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,460
where we're going to see malicious

793
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,649
suspicious and benign indicators or

794
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,930
recognitions things that looked

795
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,460
different to something and work because

796
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,070
they were different was that an attacker

797
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,560
things that look like an attacker at a

798
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,030
certain phase but was it an attacker

799
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,320
doing that or somewhere else

800
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,000
we were typically class

801
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,590
in security operations as oh that's a

802
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,530
false positive and it of an attacker in

803
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,939
my environment no that is a signal that

804
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,710
tells us about something that was going

805
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,150
on from our perspective of detect and

806
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,070
respond yeah it wasn't that valuable

807
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:56,560
from an identified perspective that has

808
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,240
huge value there are very few vendors I

809
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,250
find in the detection response space

810
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,080
thinking about how I can make the data

811
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,300
that their solution their sensor their

812
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,250
network probe picks up valuable to my

813
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,870
colleagues in IT operations so that I

814
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,430
can begin helping them understand their

815
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,800
environment in ways that they didn't

816
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,990
before and ideally what we would love to

817
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,580
do is to also begin to apply that

818
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,100
understanding of high fidelity moderate

819
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,960
fidelity low fidelity over populations

820
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,540
of things that are important that we

821
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,310
care about so on a simple model might be

822
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,960
like you know our execs our VIPs our

823
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,370
super users if we take the human side

824
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,840
obviously there are a machine side

825
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,580
there's application side the gentleman

826
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,560
from JP Morgan who's talking about

827
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,899
application flows is this great example

828
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,610
of just another application of this and

829
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,290
we can think about those populations in

830
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,149
two ways we can think about slices

831
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:43,030
across them so I just want to know for

832
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,950
this slice of important thing what the

833
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,629
attributes are that my recognitions are

834
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,220
telling me or I can think vertically I

835
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,950
can say show me the things that are like

836
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,810
my CEOs laptop all the way through my

837
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,770
organization let me begin to understand

838
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:59,169
what that pattern looks like finally

839
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:00,580
that helps us drive changes in our

840
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:03,400
workflow specifically around

841
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,530
notifications in reviews because if I

842
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,480
know that I'm not going to get high

843
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,090
fidelity detections for certain attacks

844
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,830
step for certain attacks step paths I'm

845
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,689
not going to waste my team's time going

846
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,310
after those detection I'm going to bunt

847
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,780
all those recognitions rather I'm going

848
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,120
to bundle those up and we're going to do

849
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,649
a to weekly review to look at all the do

850
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,540
all the recognitions we had all the data

851
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,730
it was based off of but if I know that

852
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,920
in another area of my tak path I have

853
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,840
very high fidelity detection x' we're

854
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,990
going to be super focused on a 20 second

855
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,100
SLA for its or like -20 second SLA it's

856
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,300
a Gabe's point about you know knowing

857
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,560
what you've seen knowing what's probably

858
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,600
come after or knowing what's come before

859
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,760
it and we're going to hopefully be able

860
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,469
then to really focus in on how we use

861
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,480
our time so that we're not constantly

862
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,280
overloaded by these alerts which have a

863
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,060
human cost of contact switching and so

864
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,250
on and so forth

865
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:53,050
so finally a graph but not a graph

866
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,149
that's similar to a lot of the ones

867
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:58,499
we've seen

868
00:28:54,149 --> 00:29:00,389
so as we have begun to implement this

869
00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:02,099
thinking in slightly different ways and

870
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:04,228
experiment with it and find out the

871
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:07,408
flaws one of the things that we've we've

872
00:29:04,229 --> 00:29:10,769
found is immensely powerful is a lot of

873
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:12,449
the signals we get that we can turn into

874
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:14,489
recognitions if we think about them

875
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:16,979
slightly differently give me points of

876
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:18,329
evidence either about a control or from

877
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:19,529
a control so from a control perspective

878
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:21,209
it could be a control gap a control

879
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,749
failure control failure mode or so on

880
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:24,869
and so forth

881
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:26,489
and from a control it will be a bit of

882
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:28,408
telemetry from that thing that picks up

883
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:30,029
that signal and those things altima tell

884
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:31,589
me about assets now an asset could be an

885
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:34,769
entire IT system it could be a single

886
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:38,938
laptop it could be a server I am

887
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:41,609
interested in taking those recognitions

888
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:43,169
and then abstracting out what my team

889
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:44,759
are able to do when we look at this and

890
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:46,949
understand our environment and say right

891
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:49,049
well we can abstract these points of

892
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:51,239
evidence into facts that we can present

893
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:52,439
to our execs and I can also extrapolate

894
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:54,389
those out and talk about assumptions

895
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:56,009
from any point of view of a threat model

896
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:57,629
I can come up with a statement of

897
00:29:56,009 --> 00:30:00,089
adversary opportunity based on that

898
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,498
pattern I can apply fair analysis factor

899
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,928
analysis information risk by Jack Jones

900
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:06,209
to it and I can issue an advisory and my

901
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:10,589
advisory is going to be go implemented

902
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:12,869
at and I would ask how often is our

903
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:14,849
advisory in this industry based on a

904
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:17,579
true understanding of the business

905
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:19,948
technical and project context of the

906
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:21,569
asset that we're looking to protect when

907
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:23,459
we implement that pattern because

908
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,379
believe you me there is nothing more

909
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:28,019
painful than not understanding that

910
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:29,789
context going to implement control and

911
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,759
finding out that that was the wrong move

912
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:34,619
about eight months too late by which

913
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,629
time you've lost your business support

914
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:38,369
they near the project has effectively

915
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:39,869
turned into a sunk cost but there's

916
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,759
really no way back because everyone's

917
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:43,499
committed on that path but if only we'd

918
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:48,089
understood a little bit more of our

919
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:50,369
environment a bit better so hopefully

920
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:53,489
this talk is given just a few ideas

921
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:54,749
about this question which is for me one

922
00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:57,029
of the most important things how do I

923
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:59,399
bring my team around a living picture of

924
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:01,229
all these individual models that we hold

925
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,369
in our heads that we can't share we

926
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:04,289
can't get out there we can't have

927
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:05,458
course-corrected we hold these beliefs

928
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:06,509
in one day we'll be in a meeting with

929
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:08,010
someone that we honor that's completely

930
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:09,420
wrong that system doesn't connect

931
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,500
oh and there's no firewall there what do

932
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,940
you mean there's no firewall there oh

933
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,930
yeah it was in the architecture diagrams

934
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,790
but everyone on this team knows that

935
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,290
doesn't exist well hang on a minute

936
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,970
wouldn't it have been great if we could

937
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,170
share out those kind of architectural

938
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:21,180
patterns so that we could have

939
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:23,460
identified that using graphs using maps

940
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:26,370
and also this question right how do I

941
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,770
give my business the best possible data

942
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,060
to make the judgment call that is best

943
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,129
in the in the situation we're in right

944
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,929
we don't always have the data we'd like

945
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,540
but then ideally one of our options

946
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:39,300
right is to go and get more data so it

947
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,620
kind of feels that that should be that

948
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,210
should be where we're getting to with

949
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,169
graphs and I feel that we're beginning

950
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:48,060
together

951
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:49,980
so in closing when a lot of stuff like

952
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,540
talks about Gabe mentioned broadly Maps

953
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,400
I haven't put any Wardley maps in here

954
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,889
because I feel probably being enough

955
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,240
concepts Laird on concepts layered on

956
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,010
concepts in a kind of nightmarish

957
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,660
inception model where you're no longer

958
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,550
sure when they he spins the thing at the

959
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,610
end if the film is over or just

960
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:07,950
beginning but ultimately I'm interested

961
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:10,800
in using data to maximize my chances of

962
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,110
success in the environment I'm in what

963
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,610
I'm not interested in is this amazing

964
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,229
observation like you know as he said we

965
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,820
jump to technical controls when we could

966
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,560
change a process but how do I know how

967
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,389
to do that when it would take me ages to

968
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,350
interview all the multitude of teams who

969
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,910
they're changing all the time as

970
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,879
contractors come in and people move from

971
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:28,920
one team to another and our model is so

972
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,300
fluid in so many organizations of who

973
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:34,500
we're working with and who holds what

974
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,590
data in their head how do I get hold of

975
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,500
the tools to help me reason through

976
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:41,850
these higher-order challenges not to say

977
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,250
that the work that's being done in

978
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:46,260
graphs isn't immediately immensely

979
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,480
valuable but from a strategy point of

980
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,930
view how do I begin to use that and I

981
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,370
think there's a future for vendors who

982
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:56,340
realize that this is our business

983
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:58,679
problem and specifically for vendors who

984
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,230
provide sensors into our environment

985
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:05,640
because if they understand that I want

986
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:08,160
to have that data in a graph format that

987
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,410
I can query that is already joined

988
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,210
together in a way that understands the

989
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,310
ways and the patterns that I want to use

990
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:16,470
that data in to drive change across my

991
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:19,530
environment will be in a much better

992
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,660
place however until we get to that place

993
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,540
the deal is going to be

994
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,070
I'm going to take the data from your

995
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:28,080
solution I'm going to put it into my

996
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:30,540
spreadsheets and I'm going to have to

997
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,870
build my own graph which kind of means

998
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,370
and doing your job so hopefully that

999
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,139
will change but yeah thank you very much

1000
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,399
I hope that's provided some insight and

1001
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:46,290
ideas and it's been a pleasure being

1002
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:47,730
here Thanks all right okay sorry I

1003
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:51,240
didn't I thought I would have over run

1004
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:53,160
so I apologize so your talk is

1005
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,930
fascinating what is very fast I hope

1006
00:33:53,160 --> 00:34:01,230
that you're gonna share the slides so I

1007
00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:03,720
can take notes problem is that sock team

1008
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,720
or a security team IT teams have a

1009
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,889
tribal knowledge and they feel very hard

1010
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,570
to share I like this statement and I

1011
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:15,480
didn't suggest any tools that can help

1012
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:18,810
that but do you feel like something like

1013
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,850
social network that is customized

1014
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:23,790
towards these teams that they can share

1015
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,799
their investigations ideas so and do

1016
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:28,320
some data mining on top of that can help

1017
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,010
do you have you seen any tools like that

1018
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,270
or systems yeah so um thank you this is

1019
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,070
going to sound like a plug to watch

1020
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:44,389
another tool which you just mother might

1021
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:48,840
maybe like no no please yes yeah yeah

1022
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:52,830
yeah so um what we built a photo book to

1023
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:56,970
solve this is essentially a system that

1024
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:58,740
stores data in JIRA JIRA is a great

1025
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,850
graph database even though it may not

1026
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,640
seem like because it allows you to

1027
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:06,810
describe those edges and nodes we built

1028
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,190
an ontology around describing the form

1029
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,810
of a business write a business has

1030
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,280
business units those business units have

1031
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,110
different departments those departments

1032
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,880
have different sub departments they will

1033
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:17,400
have roles within them that have people

1034
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,080
attached for those roles etc etc we

1035
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,730
built a number of ontology zuv what I

1036
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,240
call these building blocks of business

1037
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:27,660
and we've begun to link telemetry and

1038
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,689
alerts to those areas so that we can

1039
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,390
understand for example this person who

1040
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:35,020
uses this account always gets this alert

1041
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:37,299
from this SAS provide

1042
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:39,850
to say that their login is suspicious

1043
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,619
even though they have to FA and over

1044
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,480
time I can build up a pattern of life

1045
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:46,720
that gives me the confidence to start

1046
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,670
ignoring alerts for example so that

1047
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,230
there is I would say it's not it's not

1048
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,390
you know it's not a finished piece of

1049
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,090
work but if you want to check out the

1050
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,830
talk from b-sides that has the system

1051
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,300
that we built and we've open sourced it

1052
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,040
so if you want to grab it it's all built

1053
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,430
off AWS Lander you can go experiment

1054
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,680
with it

1055
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:04,450
we built actually a mini company with

1056
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,368
all this data in a graph so it's not

1057
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,430
just typical sock data that you'd see it

1058
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:10,390
is business unit business owner CEO

1059
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,859
incident there's like a whole load of

1060
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,569
data in there and you can go and play

1061
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,070
around with that and and I haven't seen

1062
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,600
anything that does that so we built our

1063
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,830
own and we did it through using slackers

1064
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,750
come online a bunch of other groovy

1065
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:24,190
stuff but I didn't know Ram actually

1066
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,470
invited me he's like come talk about the

1067
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:28,420
stuff in JIRA that you did and then I

1068
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,310
was talking to Gabe and gave us I want

1069
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,890
to use your your talk from V sides to

1070
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,540
indicate how complicated this stuff gets

1071
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,529
and those that I'm cool with that but I

1072
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,330
thought well I really need to go and

1073
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,890
share the thinking behind the talk that

1074
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,569
we did at V side so this is like almost

1075
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,190
the prequel of like these were all the

1076
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,780
ideas we were having when we built that

1077
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,130
which I didn't get to share and b-side

1078
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,830
so that as the best answer that I have

1079
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,840
but if anyone else has seen anything I'd

1080
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,240
be I think there's a sort of fascinating

1081
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,790
project being done by Sascha Faust

1082
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,649
steamer lift around AWS and they called

1083
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,150
it the cartography project right a map I

1084
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,650
don't think that's a coincidence so

1085
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,390
definitely there are other people

1086
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:05,340
looking at doing I think similar things

1087
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,339
especially over changing landscapes can

1088
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,090
take one more question

1089
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:14,979
all right let's give it up to Jim there

1090
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:20,499
was one of the back there as the hand

1091
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:21,939
went up you can just you can just shout

1092
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:23,618
I'm also really jet-lagged so I'm now

1093
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,470
going to start slowly collapsing on the

1094
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:30,700
stage maybe I should have bowed out

1095
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:33,038
let's see I a part of your talk seemed

1096
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,669
to say that we should be moving away

1097
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:38,440
from controls and torrid processes and

1098
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,479
for my observations processes tend to

1099
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,190
break when people move teams do you have

1100
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:45,729
any recommendations on how to strengthen

1101
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:48,299
the process as well yes so I think we

1102
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:51,460
have to think about this in terms of

1103
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:53,049
time frames where we are today often

1104
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,249
we're dealing with legacy processes have

1105
00:37:53,049 --> 00:37:55,630
been in place for 20 years 15 years

1106
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:57,038
whatever it is and shifting those are

1107
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,180
very difficult especially when you know

1108
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,499
there's this nightmare mesh of

1109
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,999
applications that join stuff together

1110
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:02,319
which no really understands and once you

1111
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:04,450
start pulling on one strand the whole

1112
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:06,430
thing collapses however if we look at

1113
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:09,220
different environments and so soon oleg

1114
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,890
you again has a framework he calls D ie

1115
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,299
distributed immutable ephemeral so

1116
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,729
environments where you can literally

1117
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:17,589
tear stuff down and bring stuff up I

1118
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:20,019
think there will be a different ability

1119
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,489
to change business processes that they

1120
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:25,089
rely on technical processes in a few

1121
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:27,670
years I have no particular solution or

1122
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:30,279
idea about that now all I can say is

1123
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,349
that what I found in a lot of the

1124
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:33,910
environments I've worked in is that

1125
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:37,509
there was not sufficient understanding

1126
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:39,640
of interrelationships and business

1127
00:38:37,509 --> 00:38:41,469
change programs either through run build

1128
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,900
or continuous improvement before

1129
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:45,849
security would run in and go we need to

1130
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,069
implement something on top of this there

1131
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:51,099
were more elegant solutions to be found

1132
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:52,839
by making simple changes however digging

1133
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:55,630
through the sediment that that requires

1134
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,650
can take six months and by that point

1135
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,940
it's too late because you've already

1136
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,019
started that's kind of what I was

1137
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,210
mentioning about implementing other

1138
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:04,029
controls on so we need a better way to

1139
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,319
dig through the sediment and we may have

1140
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:06,519
to just live with the fact that we need

1141
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:09,308
to start building that up ourselves

1142
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:11,319
because security as a function touches

1143
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:13,509
every single area of the business we can

1144
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:15,279
get that data it's just we can't get it

1145
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:16,569
today in a scalable way we have to get

1146
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:18,069
it by doing consulting and then putting

1147
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:20,200
the consulting in the PDF that no one

1148
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:22,430
reads and then it's out of date so yeah

1149
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,839
it's not a simple problem but hopefully

1150
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,839
that is an answer yes thank you how much

1151
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:31,239
[Applause]
