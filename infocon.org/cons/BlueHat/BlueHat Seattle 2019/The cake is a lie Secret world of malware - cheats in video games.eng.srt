4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:21,400
hello blukic how are you still alive

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:27,490
after lunch okay perfect so let me begin

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,288
with the story this is not the match

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,570
from yesterday from the Seattle Sounders

8
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:34,930
this is something different do you know

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:38,949
who that man is Diego Maradona that's

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,420
correct so the year is 1986 we were

11
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:42,250
playing I mean

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:46,390
Argentina was playing against England

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:49,210
for the World Cup quarter-finals and we

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:54,360
were 1:1 and PIPA Maradona has called

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:57,400
this cold we want that much two-to-one

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,350
he but the difference or the important

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,470
thing here is that he scored the goal

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:06,549
with his hand and no one even noticed at

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,979
the time afterwards some journalists

20
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:11,110
came to to ask him like do like the

21
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:12,850
humour alone is like this high there is

22
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,940
no way he could have jumped that high

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:20,740
and they asked him do how did you manage

24
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:23,140
to score that goal and he told them half

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:28,720
of the goal was to Maradona and the

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:31,060
other half was the hand of God like 10

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,370
years later they did the same interview

28
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,230
in Milan where he was playing at the

29
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,930
time and they asked him Diego did he

30
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:42,700
cheat and he said yeah yeah I did it is

31
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:45,100
Cordova with my hand so this is one of

32
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,980
the most clear examples about cheating

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,860
and since I'm Argentinean I can see this

34
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,320
every day I'm not proud of it we won but

35
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,680
you know it's not something I'd tell

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,740
people but we are here to talk about

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,940
video games so you might wonder like

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,589
have I gone crazy

39
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,158
well maybe but there are other types of

40
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,408
cheater

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,190
for example this man here I don't know

42
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:14,349
if you know him

43
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:17,019
his name is Todd Rogers he holds the

44
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:19,720
most amount of Guinness records for

45
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:21,880
playing video games for example that

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,800
game that he has in his hand is called

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,959
dragster it's an old video game from the

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,500
80s

49
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,909
and he did the fastest lap in I'm going

50
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,489
to lose round number like 5 seconds then

51
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:37,349
someone a reverse engineer of course

52
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:39,989
reverse the code of the game and you

53
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,879
know told the Guinness people like the

54
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,519
fastest lap you can do in this game is 6

55
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,030
seconds how did he manage to do it in 5

56
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,359
and then people start poking into other

57
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,340
records he hold it so for example he had

58
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,950
the highest record for another game

59
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,230
where you could only score in even

60
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,760
numbers and he had an odd number of

61
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,138
record of course then Activision came to

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,939
the rescue and said yeah we develop the

63
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,939
game there is no way he could have done

64
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:12,150
this so he lost every Guinness records

65
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:17,030
he had and that was one of the first

66
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,030
cases of you know professional cheating

67
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,530
the cake is a lie some of you might know

68
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:27,120
this phrase I hope by the end of this

69
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,569
presentation you know what I'm talking

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,280
about and if not I will be in the

71
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:34,738
speaker's booth a speaker's corner later

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,659
my name isn't Aomori Dahle I'm part of

73
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:41,430
the Global Research analysis team with

74
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:44,728
Kaspersky Lab and I felt like this need

75
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,859
to speak about video games and cheating

76
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,439
because I think there is a black hole in

77
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:53,040
the industry it's not something that you

78
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,930
see being spoke about in gaming

79
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,608
conferences it's not something that we

80
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,370
speak about in information security

81
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:01,590
conferences nevertheless this is a huge

82
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,780
industry and a huge problem for the

83
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,909
gaming industry as well so I thought

84
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,909
okay maybe I could do something about it

85
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:14,280
and when I tell people about video games

86
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,228
I always use this phrase and I don't

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,418
know if you can read it way back so I'm

88
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,279
going to read to you if pac-man has

89
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,289
affected us as kids we all be running

90
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,210
around in dark rooms munching pills and

91
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:30,780
listening to repetitive electronic music

92
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:33,750
this phrase was quoted before to the

93
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,609
former CEO of Nintendo then a British

94
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,620
comedian said like hey that's my phrase

95
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,480
that's not from a Nintendo

96
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,760
but the thing is video games have

97
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,670
influencing us much more than we would

98
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,380
like to acknowledge for example the

99
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:51,170
image that you have in the background is

100
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:54,390
a tournament for league of legends that

101
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:57,150
let's say it has over 100 million

102
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,510
viewers and to put that into context the

103
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,760
last Super Bowl have 98 million viewers

104
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:06,300
so it has more viewers than the Super

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:11,370
Bowl and it had twice as much viewers

106
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,960
that the u.s. inauguration speech and of

107
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:20,880
doing to name names are not going to say

108
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:22,799
anything about that so but what are the

109
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,710
statistics for the video game industry

110
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,480
for example many people think that video

111
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,820
games are something that kids play that

112
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,530
teenagers play that they ask for money

113
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,080
to the parents and they get the games

114
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,780
they get the DLCs or Micron's

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,900
transactions in reality people that play

116
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:45,630
video games are on average 33 years old

117
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:50,609
it's pretty much divided equally between

118
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:53,870
female and male in us in America

119
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,510
sixty-five percent of every person of

120
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:01,860
every people in America play video games

121
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:04,909
and 30 percent of them pay a monthly

122
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,230
subscription fee that is to play online

123
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,930
maybe to have access to the game to have

124
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:12,780
access to other items they pay after the

125
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:17,640
game they pay something else so please

126
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:19,440
remember this number and what happens

127
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,780
when we compared the gaming industry to

128
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,590
other industries for example let's say

129
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,380
Hollywood the music industry television

130
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,880
these numbers are for 2017 for example

131
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,770
the video gaming or the video game

132
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:40,710
industry had a revenue of 117 billion

133
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:45,120
that's billion dollars for 2018 it was

134
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:48,810
around 130 and this year it will be 160

135
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,040
so you can see that it's bigger than

136
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,980
Hollywood's bigger than the music

137
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,980
industry

138
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,430
and not many people are paying attention

139
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,380
to it

140
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,540
we just think about video games of

141
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:04,510
something like yeah it's stir but I

142
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:08,680
don't care much about it so we're a blue

143
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:11,260
hut which is a Microsoft conference if I

144
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,080
would tell you let's say red that

145
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,180
product Redemption - I know how many of

146
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,789
you have played it I played it I waited

147
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:23,920
for installation of 120 gigabytes and I

148
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:26,980
played the game if I would tell you

149
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,670
between this game and adventures

150
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:35,670
infinity war which one do you think had

151
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:38,650
the biggest revenue yes the video game

152
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:43,570
in the first three days after being

153
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:45,940
launched this game totally seven hundred

154
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,040
and twenty-five million USD and we're

155
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,060
comparing to a triple a movie Hollywood

156
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:55,780
blockbuster movie so you can see the

157
00:07:52,060 --> 00:08:00,930
magnitude of the industry but we are

158
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:03,849
here to speak about cheating in the year

159
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:08,050
1996 and this is no coincidence with you

160
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,970
Maradona economy developer was porting a

161
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,810
dream to a Nintendo Entertainment System

162
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:17,350
and he got tired you know about testing

163
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:19,990
restarting the game testing again so he

164
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,420
said I'm going to include a code that is

165
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,490
going to allow me to get 99 life and I'm

166
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,800
going to play as much as I want without

167
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,700
having to restart the game and he lead

168
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,190
this sequence of arrows of keys and then

169
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,799
buttons and with that he was able to

170
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:39,220
play the game debug it test it ported

171
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:43,199
and if you want to see the extent of how

172
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,460
video games and this cheating issue has

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,160
been present in your lives

174
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:53,340
we can see a very clear example I love

175
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,339
this video maybe you can agree

176
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,830
all right come on if Mission Control

177
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,270
thought we could help get the shuttle

178
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,090
out of orbit it can't be that hard okay

179
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:03,760
okay I try this hit up up down down left

180
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:10,720
right left right B a start and we'll

181
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:13,090
have unlimited lives so if I would have

182
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,040
my parents to like what did you see that

183
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,530
he wouldn't have any idea of what does

184
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,319
it mean but as you can see video games

185
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:23,319
and cheating have been part of our lives

186
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,270
and what do I mean when I say that this

187
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,390
is becoming a huge issue that this is

188
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,829
becoming an industry for example I don't

189
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,480
know if you remember world of warcraft

190
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:38,190
at the time in the year 2013 it held

191
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,780
over 12 million players playing online

192
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,090
so someone decided to create a cheat

193
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,540
that was a simple script it was called

194
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:50,470
whoa lighter and he was selling this

195
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:54,069
cheat for 25 USD but he sold 100,000 of

196
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,500
this pieces of software so you can see

197
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:01,630
2.5 million dollars just with a single

198
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:03,220
cheat and it was the year 2013 as the

199
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,090
years have gone by

200
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:10,360
the problem is every day Wars and Wars

201
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:12,360
and it has become an illegal activity

202
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,520
it's not something that is frowned upon

203
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,490
when you buy a videogame or actually you

204
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,620
license a videogame you sign an end-user

205
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,150
license agreement that says you cannot

206
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,410
modify the game you cannot reverse

207
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:29,050
engineer it but there are people doing

208
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:31,000
these cheats of course this man got sued

209
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,270
by Blizzard Entertainment and he lost

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,450
six million in the lawsuit so it wasn't

211
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:43,390
such a you know good enterprise after

212
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:45,730
all then we have other video games such

213
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,340
as this one this is called APB Reloaded

214
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,820
APB Reloaded uses a different approach

215
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,770
they said like we cannot fight against

216
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:58,000
cheaters so we're going to offer a

217
00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:01,030
cheater amnesty so this they posted a

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,580
blog post they both still like an open

219
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:06,639
memorandum and they said if you're using

220
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,950
cheats you're paying between

221
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,019
fifteen to thirty dollars per month just

222
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,570
to cheat in our video games please stop

223
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:22,339
now before we bind your account and you

224
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:23,870
will lose way more much money I don't

225
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:26,360
know if you ever cheated if you've

226
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,070
downloaded cheat before but it's for me

227
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,010
very interesting to see how these

228
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,829
websites look for example this is just

229
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:36,920
one of the many many cheat websites

230
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:39,399
available where you can buy software

231
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,649
hacks modification for different games

232
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,170
and you can pay a subscription model so

233
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:49,220
let's say that you buy a triple a game

234
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:52,459
for $59.99 you can buy the cheat for $54

235
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,410
to me that's a little crazy but there

236
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:58,069
are cheats for example that can be used

237
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:01,130
in eSports so the guy that develops the

238
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:04,279
cheat guarantees you that it won't be

239
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,649
detected that you can use it to get

240
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:09,050
money from you can use it online it will

241
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:16,269
be private only to you so this is

242
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:19,459
cheating as a service for example in

243
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:21,170
video games known as FPS or first-person

244
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:24,609
shooters you can have something called

245
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:27,199
ESP that means extra sensual perception

246
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,620
that means that you become something of

247
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:32,329
a god so you can see behind walls you

248
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,740
can for example you can shoot straight

249
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:39,739
ahead and the bullet will go behind you

250
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,180
you can for example teleport yourself to

251
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,449
our locations you can do about some

252
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,939
things that the developers of these

253
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:49,550
games were didn't think it was possible

254
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,459
but the thing is that when you design

255
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,219
when you program a videogame you need to

256
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:58,399
put a lot of trust in the client and

257
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,040
this is because you need a network

258
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,290
architecture that will have the least

259
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,180
amount of lag so people want to play

260
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,800
games but they want aims to be fast and

261
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,019
if you want a game to be fast you only

262
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,420
need the least amount of information

263
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:14,240
possible to a server so there are some

264
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,760
games like dota 2 right now that have

265
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,270
shifted their code like 90% to the

266
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:25,400
server but this means that the game

267
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:28,220
runs a little slower but what about

268
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,280
consoles you may ask well people have

269
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,750
found a way around that too and I'm very

270
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,860
eager about listening to the next

271
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:39,890
presentation about Xbox but for example

272
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,140
they have an hack the Xbox but they are

273
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,560
doing these things for example they get

274
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:48,890
an Arduino box or they come by a USB

275
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,310
dongle you can load the script and you

276
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:55,010
can for example use a script to auto

277
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,959
fire to auto aim for different things

278
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,450
you can download these scripts freely

279
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,390
you don't need to modify your console

280
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:07,220
you just modify how your input is going

281
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:09,740
to your console by the way this is from

282
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,290
Brazil this is a Brazilian websites such

283
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,930
as eBay Mercado Libre anything that you

284
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:20,449
want to buy illegally is in Mercado

285
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:23,689
Libre so then there is the other side of

286
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,490
the coin and digital solutions for

287
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,000
example Bob software has their own

288
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:31,790
anti-cheating solution and the thing is

289
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,440
to protect the users you need to know

290
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,170
what is happening in their environments

291
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,420
in their systems so some people started

292
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:41,569
wondering hey what about privacy you are

293
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,430
looking at my memory my processes your

294
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,930
look at my programs you look at my

295
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,599
keystrokes what is happening with that

296
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,250
so both software said we are not

297
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,040
interested in looking at your porn

298
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,050
surfing habits we are just interested in

299
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,310
looking that you don't have any cheats

300
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,660
installed but then other video games

301
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,119
have started implementing these

302
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,459
anti-cheating solutions and the FF says

303
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,840
like yeah this is all nice and dandy but

304
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:11,690
what about privacy so this is an issue

305
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,140
that we are having over and over again

306
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,570
because as I mention I'm part of the

307
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,939
research team of CAF perky and you know

308
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,980
antivirus always had this issue like hey

309
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,310
you're looking at my connections yeah

310
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,260
but if I want to protect you from

311
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,079
malware I need to see what you're doing

312
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,150
of course there is a fine line between

313
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,070
protecting and going above and beyond

314
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:38,720
but this thing

315
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,880
is very serious so what's the

316
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,710
consequence of cheating that means

317
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,300
people not playing the games anymore

318
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,690
video games depend on one thing and you

319
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:53,449
know like social media or you know any

320
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,520
form of entertainment it depends on the

321
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,930
rewards that you get there are people

322
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,910
engineering there are people doing

323
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,280
studies how often you should get a

324
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:04,760
reward so they can keep you hooked up

325
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,640
you can do keep playing the game but if

326
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,860
someone is cheating you stop having fun

327
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,720
you stop getting that reward you stop

328
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,150
paying the subscription you stop playing

329
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,220
the game and that is why some games have

330
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:19,449
become so toxic online that people

331
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:24,340
simply stop playing and this is costing

332
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,340
publishers and developers a lot of money

333
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:31,550
what is the solution right now they are

334
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,010
using a lot of interesting ways to ban

335
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,589
cheaters they are using a technique that

336
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:40,520
is called delayed ban so they don't bind

337
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,870
you right away in order not to give any

338
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,449
information about the cheats they are

339
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,490
detecting but for example for counter

340
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,290
strike global offensive which is quite

341
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:52,760
an old game they are burning between

342
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:55,040
let's say 901 million players every

343
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:59,540
three months so that's a lot of people

344
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:05,869
but also new games served such as pub G

345
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:09,319
are burning like 13 million players and

346
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:14,780
what is happening in Korea but I mean

347
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:16,879
the other Korea so you know like eSports

348
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,910
is right now big things in in South

349
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,439
Korea there are eSport tournaments are

350
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,250
played for millions of dollars for

351
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:28,280
example the latest dota 2 tournament had

352
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,980
a price of 30 million dollars so if you

353
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:34,610
want to play video games now at the time

354
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:38,260
if you have kids encourage them but

355
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:41,270
Gamecocks are illegal in South Korea and

356
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,700
even in China right now the other day I

357
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,060
saw

358
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,280
a news piece that was saying that they

359
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,260
caught some people developing cheats and

360
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,899
they are now being prosecuted and they

361
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:56,920
might likely go to jail just for

362
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,980
developing cheats but on the other side

363
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:03,340
in South Korea it's fine to cheat on

364
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,650
your wife or your husband using software

365
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:12,100
not so much so that's how crazy were

366
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:14,110
right now but in the title of this

367
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,360
presentation I mentioned mal warlike

368
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:20,020
cheats what do I mean with that

369
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:22,719
so cheats use the very same techniques

370
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,790
that we see when we analyze malware they

371
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,800
are part they are protected they use

372
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:29,430
commercial protective solutions such as

373
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:33,820
I know being protect the mida they use

374
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:40,420
codification but more than that some

375
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:43,419
cheats are using exploits to get Colonel

376
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,820
access some are using rootkit behavior

377
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,920
to hide from the NT cheating solutions

378
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,980
and of course when you download these

379
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,210
cheats in the website it tells you

380
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,710
please disable your antivirus solution

381
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,870
so people are risking their personal

382
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,840
information they are risking maybe

383
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:09,790
they're working for mation just to play

384
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:13,480
and win a video game so why I'm speaking

385
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:15,670
about this here well I think this is a

386
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,790
growing illegal economy the numbers are

387
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:20,800
showing that this is not someone selling

388
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,690
a cheat for a couple of you know hundred

389
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,389
dollars this is a multi-million dollar

390
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,460
industry and as security professionals

391
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,460
we are more than equipped to deal with

392
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,490
this the thing is that it overlaps with

393
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,280
the gaming industry and I think it's

394
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,810
very difficult to Cottam gaming industry

395
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,910
and talk about reverse engineering or

396
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,740
someone from the gaming industry come

397
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,820
here and talk about video games so I'm

398
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:48,310
trying to bridge that gap this is an

399
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,580
emerging research area

400
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,350
I've seen some papers already published

401
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,199
I have a paper that will be published

402
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,299
next week so it's not about only the

403
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,070
Malone and some nice pictures I hope

404
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:04,539
that if you like the topic you will be

405
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:06,370
able to read it and then there is mal

406
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:11,230
war because there are some cheats that

407
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:12,850
are been disguised as you know hacks

408
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,370
modifications whatever but at Marwar

409
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,320
there are others that are using malware

410
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,768
techniques for example I saw a forum

411
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:24,189
that he was using

412
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:28,480
Toula injection technique just to to get

413
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:30,190
access to injecting the code and using

414
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,350
the the cheat without being detected

415
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:37,690
so that that's how far we've come cheat

416
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,789
codes in the past were just the Konami

417
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:44,409
code right now it's a business and we

418
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:48,309
can do something about it so the cake is

419
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:50,620
a lie if you don't remember what this is

420
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:52,899
about you need to play the game portal 2

421
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,500
I don't know how many of you have played

422
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:56,559
it before

423
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:00,580
but this is a this is a very difficult

424
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:04,269
game and at certain point you get the

425
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,490
promise that if you do a repo so if you

426
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:08,830
complete every challenge at the end of

427
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,950
the game there will be a cake what

428
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:14,408
happens when you finish the game there

429
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:18,429
is no cake and you only get a graffiti

430
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:20,500
that says the cake is a lie the end so I

431
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:22,389
hope you are not getting that feeling

432
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,770
from this presentation looking forward

433
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:30,599
to your feedback thank you so much

434
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,599
[Applause]
