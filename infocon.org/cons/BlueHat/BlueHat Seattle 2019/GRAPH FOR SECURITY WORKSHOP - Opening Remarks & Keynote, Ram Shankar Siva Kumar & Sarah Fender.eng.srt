1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
hello hey first of all thank you all for

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,500
coming

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,830
my name is not Sara fender my name is

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,129
ROM I'm one of the core organizers with

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,949
John Lambert for this workshop so before

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,420
we get started I'm gonna like ask

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:21,480
everybody who is seated on this nice

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,039
corner row to defragment themselves like

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,990
windows and just like move to the

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,900
corners so that way if there's anybody

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,369
who is like coming in later they can

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,198
easily find her seat so if you're

13
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,329
sitting in the corner row I know it's

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,550
annoying trust me or you have another

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,700
opportunity it's probably come a little

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,390
forward so that you know anybody who is

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,500
coming in will easily be able to find a

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,539
seat okay sorry about that so first of

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,190
all as you know people are settling in I

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,809
want to give you a little bit more

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,289
context as to why we started this

22
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:59,070
workshop turns out that graphs for

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:02,070
security is super hot you know it goes

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,840
all the way back to like 2009 you're

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,570
gonna see a rich history of it as well

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,820
but when John and I I'm part of the

27
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,548
cloud in the eyes security data science

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,639
group and John as you all know runs the

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,229
Microsoft threat intelligence center

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,229
turns out that from boats from a

31
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,780
security standpoint and from a machine

32
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,869
learning standpoint graphs are extremely

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,000
pliable tools for analytics and today

34
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,579
you're gonna see a very different sort

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,520
of like graphs and we're gonna explore

36
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:36,720
what it means to do graph based analysis

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,140
from a database perspective from like a

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,789
tool perspective like machine learning

39
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,159
perspective so we're trying to give you

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,490
a different taste it's gonna be a little

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,649
bit more of a tasting menu as opposed to

42
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,059
like one single entree so hopefully you

43
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,030
know you're you know you're already like

44
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,619
considering yourself for that and before

45
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,540
we get started how many of you would

46
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,840
consider yourself actually how many of

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,030
you are from Microsoft oh that's that's

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,210
actually a lot more than I thought

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,009
how many of you consider yourself sick

50
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,030
okay security engineers everybody how

51
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,108
many of you consider yourself to be

52
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,540
working primarily in data science

53
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:16,590
okay how many of you I see like David's

54
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,689
hands like this

55
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,810
yeah I'm not sure how many of you

56
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:25,379
consider yourself like more as security

57
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,629
analysts okay that's actually a fair bit

58
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,459
of group how many of you would say like

59
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:33,120
you know what he'll to all of you I'm an

60
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:36,569
engineer like I build a platform I build

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,099
a system behind it okay so as you can

62
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,839
see with this diverse group

63
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,459
you know the tasting menu approach

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,499
really does work you know there's gonna

65
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,939
be something for everybody and you know

66
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:46,829
I'm sure like some of you are gonna

67
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,480
learn something new and for some of you

68
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:52,859
it's gonna be reinforcement of what

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,388
you've already seen and before I you

70
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:56,159
know start I want to thank all the

71
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,319
volunteers so kind of like you know

72
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:04,439
putting this show up you know

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:06,719
Faraz Wallner swarupa Sylvie and the

74
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,578
entire blue hat crew you know it's

75
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,858
really easy for us to bring the warm

76
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,750
bodies but you know without the

77
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,120
infrastructure that blue hat kind of

78
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,459
like volunteers it's super hard I also

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,680
want to thank the speakers I know that

80
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,530
John Hawes is traveled all the way from

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,180
the UK for this and the people have

82
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,220
travelled from different parts of world

83
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,489
to come and kind of entertain you today

84
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,349
so with that I'm gonna get started it's

85
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,280
my pleasure to kind of like have the

86
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:37,560
keynote from Sarah fender Sarah fender

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,470
is the GPM for the cloud in the high

88
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,650
security group prior to that she led the

89
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,359
security initiatives for Microsoft Azure

90
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,759
including Azure security center

91
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:51,439
she actually joined Microsoft in 2012

92
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:53,698
through the phone FAQ for acquisition

93
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,530
where she kind of led a variety of

94
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,900
different tools and and she was in fact

95
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,469
the vice president for product

96
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,959
management

97
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:03,060
she's got extensive experience in

98
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,400
security and compliance and has been in

99
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,829
the industry for 15 years but I always

100
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,019
go to her and ask hey Sarah like what's

101
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:14,209
the best place for me to get good pies

102
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:17,298
so thank you Sarah for joining us today

103
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:17,298
thank you

104
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:24,410
no expert on pies I just want to get

105
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:27,380
that off but my husband is a chef which

106
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,729
is why Rob and I often talk food so I

107
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,860
just want to say thank you for having me

108
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:32,840
today and I really think this is a very

109
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,250
interesting topic and I appreciate the

110
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,099
opportunity to kind of share with you a

111
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,199
little bit of my perspective and to also

112
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,479
hear from you guys about what you're

113
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,699
doing with the graph with graphs I

114
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:49,520
should say Microsoft have really been

115
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,770
thinking about the application of graphs

116
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,400
for security for quite some time now and

117
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:58,250
that worked off in the 2009 era when a

118
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:04,070
trio of Microsoft researchers published

119
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:06,110
a document let's say to combating

120
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,419
lateral movement it was called heat-ray

121
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,940
was the approach and it it really

122
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:14,599
focused on this idea of of combating

123
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,500
snowball identity attacks I guess in the

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,510
term we can all kind of get an

125
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,240
understanding of what someone's gained a

126
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,400
foothold there and I is that to move

127
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,840
laterally and lateral movement to

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,650
everyone sort of understands that today

129
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,289
it's very you know common everyday sort

130
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,760
of understanding that we have a security

131
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:34,190
analysts and researchers but back then

132
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,740
it was a relatively new approach so he

133
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,200
really focused on on using graphs to

134
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,220
sort of map out the relationships

135
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,080
between users and identities and

136
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,479
machines and security groups with the

137
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,389
goal of identifying edges that could be

138
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,760
cut to stop that snowball effect from

139
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:55,070
happening so looking for even miniscule

140
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:59,659
edges in those graphs that could be used

141
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:02,719
to to stop that snowball effect and then

142
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,690
if we fast forward a bit to 2015 John

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,060
Lambert published a pretty interesting

144
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,070
blog post that really highlighted this

145
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,050
important distinction between the way

146
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,940
the defenders are thinking and the way

147
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,560
that attackers are thinking and that

148
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,660
really highlighted the fact that that

149
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,160
defenders are working on lists they have

150
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,400
lists of assets they've lists of

151
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,930
machines and list of users and but

152
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,400
attackers are really thinking more about

153
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,229
what are the connections between those

154
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,560
things and that's important for them

155
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,840
because they need once they

156
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,280
gained a little foothold within the

157
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,200
organization they need to be able to

158
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,989
move out and in order to be able to

159
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,080
execute their objectives and so really

160
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:44,190
just getting defenders to pivot and and

161
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,020
begin to think about less linear list of

162
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,860
things and more about the connections

163
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,419
between these things and at 20 and 2017

164
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,760
Satya introduced this concept of the

165
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:56,250
intelligence security graph at Microsoft

166
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,550
ignite and this really represents this

167
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:02,220
this concept this approach but the

168
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,780
insights that we have gained from the

169
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,880
trillions of signal signals that we

170
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,849
analyze here at Microsoft provides

171
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,960
really valuable visibility into

172
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:14,639
connections between users devices

173
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,440
infrastructure and and more it's really

174
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,960
highlighting and conceptually the

175
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,940
importance of graphs as we try to tackle

176
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,419
these very very challenging security

177
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,419
issues today

178
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:31,690
so why why all of this buzz about graphs

179
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,919
white wire grass important wire real

180
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,880
maybe a diversity of reasons but a

181
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,460
couple of things I wanted to highlight

182
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,289
first is that we all know it goes

183
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,258
without saying that that AI is going to

184
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:44,750
be a force multiplier for defenders and

185
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:48,080
what is the fuel behind AI its data and

186
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,699
we need more data and more diversity of

187
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,930
data to really make those machine

188
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:55,789
learning models sing and and with that

189
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,720
kind of some challenges though so we've

190
00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,520
got just huge volumes of data that we

191
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,220
need to sort of make sense of and we

192
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,830
need more diversity of data meaning we

193
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,960
need data from across the stack we need

194
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,448
data about infrastructure and users and

195
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,190
devices and network activity we need all

196
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:17,870
of these different kinds of signal types

197
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,979
but making sense of all of that can be

198
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,870
quite challenging and that's really

199
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:23,840
where graphs can come in so they can

200
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:27,620
make that large volume of diverse data

201
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,630
more usable for AI they provide

202
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,130
structure and then also very very

203
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,130
importantly is context

204
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,020
so it makes a graph a graph I think

205
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,400
we're gonna hear lots of different

206
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,880
interpretations lots of different

207
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,260
perspectives on this today you know we

208
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,380
can ask ourselves is a graph a graph

209
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,689
database you know do you have to have a

210
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,030
face in order to have a graph do you

211
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,280
need to have a unified entity model with

212
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,589
the nodes and edges is that what a graph

213
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,660
is is it the pretty charts and graphs

214
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,430
where we can see on the screen you know

215
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,520
bubbles and lines connecting the

216
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,439
different bubbles is that those kinds of

217
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,840
visualizations I would argue the most

218
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,610
important thing the really underlying

219
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,220
fundamental thing that defines a graph

220
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,920
is relationships and so as we think and

221
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,970
hear from different topics or presenters

222
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,280
throughout the day about different

223
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,020
approaches they're taking to do

224
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,550
graphical analysis I think the one

225
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,280
thread that I would expect to see sort

226
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,089
of comment across those is this concept

227
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,089
of relationships

228
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:34,779
so as we apply a very broad definition

229
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:36,279
of graphs for security I wanted to talk

230
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,919
for just a moment about how the

231
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,189
Microsoft graph fits in how many of you

232
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,848
are familiar with the Microsoft graph

233
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:45,608
good a good number

234
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:47,289
so my team owns the Microsoft graph

235
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:48,129
security API which we'll talk about here

236
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:50,379
in just a minute

237
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:52,449
and I often often often get asked the

238
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:56,189
question is the Microsoft graph a real

239
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:59,289
graph is it a real grass

240
00:09:56,189 --> 00:10:02,439
and I would argue that in many ways it

241
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:05,699
does represent those relationships that

242
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:07,509
that make fundamentally a graph a graph

243
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:10,598
so for those of you who aren't familiar

244
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:15,009
the Microsoft graph is sort of a single

245
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:17,649
end point for connecting to data across

246
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:19,599
Microsoft 365 in particular and now even

247
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:23,759
as your and some other some third-party

248
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:26,139
systems as well so it's it provides one

249
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,299
integrated way to access that data so

250
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:30,909
one endpoint that you access with one

251
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:34,419
authentication key there's one SDK so

252
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:36,999
sort of bringing together access to

253
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:41,848
these systems and data through a single

254
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:44,819
graph endpoint graph Microsoft comm

255
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:48,249
we're doing from a security perspective

256
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:52,059
tune up an entity in the graph specific

257
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:54,220
for security workloads and and it

258
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:56,858
operates in a little bit of a unique way

259
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,009
versus other entities that are in the

260
00:10:56,859 --> 00:11:03,249
graph so it is a unified REST API it

261
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:05,649
does provide a uniform for curity

262
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:07,599
entities but it's a bit different about

263
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,729
it is that it acts as a federated broker

264
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:11,319
so in many cases when you ask the graph

265
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:13,359
for information about a user for example

266
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:15,399
it's getting that information likely

267
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:16,929
from Azure Active Directory or about a

268
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,209
file it's getting that information from

269
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:23,589
let's say SharePoint but in the world of

270
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:26,108
security as we know or if French

271
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,629
security controls many from Microsoft

272
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:30,519
but many from vendors other than

273
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:32,559
Microsoft and so they've got all of

274
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,499
these systems generating data and alerts

275
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,689
and security recommendations and so

276
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:39,309
being able to operate all of on top of

277
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:41,199
all of that data can be quite complex

278
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:42,880
they have different API even

279
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,070
inside Microsoft each of our security

280
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,560
products and services has their own set

281
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,110
of api's that they expose virtually all

282
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,550
of those in independent schema and so

283
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,080
just making sense of all of these things

284
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,020
in the world of security can be quite

285
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,190
complex so the the security API works a

286
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,800
little bit differently and that it takes

287
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,330
a request from an application and it

288
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,859
federates that out to all of the

289
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,170
security providers inside of Microsoft

290
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,850
and some third parties as well and it

291
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,130
returns back an aggregated list of

292
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,570
results in that common schema and we'll

293
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:14,439
take a look at a moment at some examples

294
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:19,450
of how that's useful so it is not a

295
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:22,540
graph database it is not a big door it's

296
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:24,910
on a date a lake it's not a dashboard

297
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,130
it's there's no user experience I'm

298
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,630
going to show you a demo in a moment but

299
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,850
that's really just a sample app that we

300
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,850
provide to kind of give some some ideas

301
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,560
of how you can what kinds of insights

302
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,510
you can get from the graph and it's not

303
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,589
a sim we have a send that's a sentinel

304
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:44,770
the graph is not that so let's just take

305
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:50,410
a quick look do just a super short demo

306
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:53,560
to give you a quick idea of some of the

307
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:56,490
graph like insights that you can get

308
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,489
from the security API

309
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:07,630
so as I said earlier at the grass

310
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,459
security API is an API it does not have

311
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,980
a user experience it's not a finished

312
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:13,420
product we don't sell it but we do

313
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,800
provide a sample application which is

314
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,180
what we're looking at here which just

315
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,719
makes it easier for developers to kind

316
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,760
of get started using it and and you can

317
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,620
see in the graph we've got some sort of

318
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,390
dashboard like functions all of these

319
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,459
are ultimately operating on top of

320
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,110
simple queries to the graph security API

321
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,520
but you can see how you can take those

322
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,620
queries and really you know put those

323
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,180
into charts and graphs and and tables

324
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,270
where you can easily drive insights out

325
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,699
of that data so what I'm going to show

326
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,110
is if we click in on let's say we want

327
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,000
to look at alerts for a particular

328
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:47,110
provider in this case as your Security

329
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,510
Center you can see the query that's

330
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,550
that's being operated to return these

331
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:57,160
results to us and the ability to easily

332
00:13:51,550 --> 00:14:00,790
pivot based on different aspects of that

333
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,130
alert so we could for example look for

334
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,319
only Security Center alerts that are

335
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:07,540
high severity or based on status and

336
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,860
again we can look across multiple alerts

337
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,439
here I've just drilled down into a shore

338
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,180
security Center as an example if I had

339
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,980
removed removed that filter I would see

340
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,910
all of the high severity or all of the

341
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:22,209
alerts firing across to my environment

342
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,990
just when a click in on one of these so

343
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:25,000
here we're looking at network

344
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,250
communication with the malicious IP

345
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,829
address and again all of this data

346
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,110
derived in a common schema from the

347
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:34,060
graph security API and we can see all of

348
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,270
the alert details here who did it come

349
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,920
from is the provider we can see

350
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:42,760
information about the network connection

351
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,380
and I mentioned earlier the ability to

352
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,450
get context so what we're looking at

353
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,520
here is some additional context that was

354
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,160
pulled not from the security API itself

355
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,480
but from other entities in the graph so

356
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,779
here we can see information about the

357
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,850
particular user related to this attack

358
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,680
patty we can see her role within the

359
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,899
organization her contact information

360
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,839
where she physically sits in case we

361
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:06,850
needed to you know have a contact with

362
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,010
her reach out to her we can also see the

363
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,570
device related to this again this

364
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,220
information is being pulled from other

365
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,080
parts of the Microsoft graph not

366
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,170
necessarily the security API

367
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,320
but provides super useful context as we

368
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,000
try to investigate this alert but what I

369
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,500
wanted to show that I think is the the

370
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,260
really graph-like

371
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,540
component of this is that because we've

372
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:34,899
got this common schema we can easily

373
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:36,670
pivot from different entities inside the

374
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:38,230
graph so here we can see all of the

375
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,719
alerts that are related to this

376
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,880
particular user across all of our

377
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,230
different security providers right so we

378
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,390
see that we've got some activity

379
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:52,120
detected by security center but also the

380
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:53,680
cloud applications security solution we

381
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,060
can go and find out are there any other

382
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,000
alerts that are firing for this

383
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,279
particular host this machine again we

384
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,570
see a set of results from a variety of

385
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,570
different security providers

386
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:10,350
we can pivot to see any other this

387
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,390
particular attack was related to malware

388
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,890
we could see any other alerts that were

389
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,620
firing they were also related to that

390
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,779
particular malware so really have the

391
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,080
ability to very very quickly and easily

392
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:25,399
through just a standard schema and a set

393
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,690
of queries to pivot between different

394
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:32,610
entities that are related to this alert

395
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:34,350
to gain additional insights so I know

396
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,480
for most of you that are doing really

397
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,080
more sophisticated graphical analysis

398
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,730
this may seem like like a very simple

399
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,600
model but I think you can see how even

400
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,730
simple application of graph like

401
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,580
approaches can be useful in the context

402
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,220
of investigation you can use the graph

403
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,140
security API to pull that data in to

404
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,270
another data store to run other kinds of

405
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,160
more sophisticated analytics on top of

406
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,170
it if you wanted to you do still get the

407
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,060
benefit of that underlying schema which

408
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,040
is common across which makes it much

409
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,849
easier as we know to run analytics on

410
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,849
top of that data

411
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,020
all right

412
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,069
back to our slides here

413
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,179
so I wanted to spend just a few minutes

414
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:28,770
talking about what's next and it would

415
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,390
be great to hear we might have a few

416
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,280
minutes at the end here to have a bit of

417
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,320
a quick discussion around it but it

418
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,730
feels like in terms of what's next for

419
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,559
graphs there's quite a bit of investment

420
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,890
going on in that detect pillar kind of

421
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:44,340
the middle part of the the security life

422
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:47,970
cycle so using graphical analysis to try

423
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,949
to detect threats maybe on the

424
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,590
investigation side to sort of understand

425
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,450
what is the scope of an attack for

426
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,120
example so lots of efforts that's

427
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,530
happening in the detection sort of

428
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,049
pillar and I expect that more of that

429
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,178
will continue over time and what we'll

430
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:06,210
see again is just more data sources and

431
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:09,539
more diversity of data sort of being

432
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,580
leveraged for that detection for those

433
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,929
detection capabilities but I also think

434
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,360
there's some interesting opportunities

435
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:17,610
for us to move out from detection into

436
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,199
protection and response we're hearing a

437
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,539
lot in the security space about

438
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,179
automation being driven by you know the

439
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,490
need to act more quickly in the face of

440
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,440
threats and also to be able to sort of

441
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,650
scale out the very limited security

442
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,409
resources that most of our customers

443
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:36,990
have to to address and investigate and

444
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:38,610
and react to these various threats and

445
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,500
so if we think about automation and what

446
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,789
it's going to take to get that done you

447
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,309
have sort of understanding the

448
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:47,940
relationships between things and where

449
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:50,370
to automate you know assessing the scope

450
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,960
and being able to act on that are some

451
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,209
things that maybe grabs might be able to

452
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,980
help us with to understand you know so

453
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,740
what are the connected things maybe with

454
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,710
similar configurations or you know

455
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,120
similar users have touched those things

456
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,970
so really thinking about how we can

457
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,199
understand those graphs and leverage

458
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:12,270
them to automate response we're doing a

459
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,770
lot of this in Azure Sentinel for

460
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,679
example which is product I work on as

461
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:20,429
well where where we can trigger these

462
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,740
series of automated play books and and

463
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:24,210
it certainly would be helpful to that

464
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,940
process to be able to understand these

465
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,110
kind of graphical relationships and then

466
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,520
also I think there's some interesting

467
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,399
stuff that can happen in the protect

468
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,139
space so as we think about you know

469
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,390
assessing

470
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,000
the security configuration of our assets

471
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:41,710
and and being able to take more

472
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,240
effective action to defend or prevent

473
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,549
attacks from from being successful in

474
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,350
the first place we at Microsoft have

475
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:50,570
some unique insights through secure

476
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,000
score I think there's some interesting

477
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,980
opportunities that may exist there to

478
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,340
sort of map out and understand you know

479
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:00,740
what where we see commonality across our

480
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,480
customers you know where where we can

481
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,890
maybe establish some relationships there

482
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,799
that might help us to more effectively

483
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:09,650
recommend or apply security protections

484
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,879
for our customers so it's just one

485
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,290
example but I definitely think there's

486
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,750
there's an additional opportunity to

487
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:17,450
apply grass on the protect side of

488
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,309
things as well we've been thinking in my

489
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,770
team a little bit about how we might be

490
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:24,678
able to leverage them for threat threat

491
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:29,840
intelligence and so you know being able

492
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:31,870
there's a there's threat intelligence is

493
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,490
in many ways not super sophisticated

494
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:36,379
today in that you know we're collecting

495
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:38,360
all kinds of information about bad

496
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,640
actors and tactics and techniques and we

497
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,729
can't apply those and to try to detect

498
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,919
and prevent attacks from those but

499
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,510
there's a huge volume of threat

500
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,860
intelligence that exists out there today

501
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,270
and many of our customers are really

502
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,100
struggling with how to make sense of

503
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,740
that and how to effectively apply that

504
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,360
within their organizations so for

505
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,700
example their firewall can only take

506
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,649
5,000 indicators or their important

507
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,360
protection solution can only take so

508
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,490
many indicators so which which

509
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,360
indicators do they give them and so

510
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,500
we're doing a little bit of

511
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,530
experimenting to see if there's

512
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,450
something we can do to understand what

513
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,570
is likely what indicators are likely to

514
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,640
target a particular customer based on

515
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,370
their configuration so can we sort of

516
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,140
map out their environment and relate

517
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,239
that to other customers that are running

518
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,000
similar kinds of environments as

519
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,220
customer B sees an attack from a

520
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,630
particular indicator can we suggest to

521
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,970
customer a that maybe that's something

522
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,410
that they also want to promote to their

523
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,060
firewall or their important protection

524
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,450
solution

525
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:41,629
for for blocking for blocking on that

526
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,580
particular threat so early days still

527
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,050
but but really thinking about how we can

528
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,639
use these graphs outside of just the

529
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,169
kind of can we use them to detect

530
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,810
threats and I think there are lots of

531
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,640
different interesting opportunities out

532
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,379
there we're thinking of some I'm sure

533
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,590
you guys have lots of ideas there as

534
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,590
well

535
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,600
so as we begin to explore these new

536
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,580
opportunities to apply graphical

537
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,399
analysis I just wanted to encourage us

538
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,770
to continue the journey together we know

539
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,030
that there's an amazing amount of work

540
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,710
that's happening not only within

541
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,070
Microsoft but out there in the industry

542
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,480
from others who are trying to to to

543
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,090
solve these these really challenging

544
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,030
security challenges through the use of

545
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,500
of graphs and so just pleased to have

546
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,910
you here today to continue those

547
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,620
discussions and look forward to

548
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:33,100
continuing to work with you as we

549
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:35,800
continue this journey going forward so I

550
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,290
have Rahm I think I've got another five

551
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,060
minutes so I'm happy to take any

552
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,590
questions I guess a question that I have

553
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,730
for you guys just as we begin the day

554
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:47,110
and and and put on our kind of

555
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,520
innovation hats what are you guys

556
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,189
thinking about in terms of new

557
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,040
applications and uses for for graph does

558
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,630
anyone want to share an area where they

559
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,629
think graphs are interesting yes

560
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:08,120
because I don't know the answer but is

561
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:12,889
there a plan or some desert planet

562
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:15,040
does work oh it's on okay my questions

563
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:19,430
pretty simple is there a plan to make

564
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:22,310
Windows update agent meted a provider on

565
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:26,150
patched levels of AAT joined devices I

566
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:28,100
do not know the answer to that but does

567
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:30,560
anyone else in the room from the windows

568
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,770
team have any insights on that let's

569
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,050
take that offline and maybe catch me

570
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,310
after the session or happy to grab your

571
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,330
contact information and see if we can

572
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:44,510
find the answer for you

573
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:46,850
Thanks what else interesting are you

574
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:49,150
guys doing with with graphs anyone else

575
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,149
want to share

576
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,390
I know it's early but I know you're

577
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,390
thinking yes

578
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:02,099
hi I'm mark Novak I actually spent 23

579
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:06,329
years at Microsoft but that ended last

580
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:08,579
year some at JPMorgan now and we are

581
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:12,539
using graphs more than all sorts of

582
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:14,698
things most well threats of course but

583
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:17,599
most recently we're trying to model

584
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:20,129
cloud applications as graphs and

585
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,958
kubernetes in particular but also more

586
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:24,269
traditional applications auto-scaling

587
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:26,939
groups in AWS as we work across all

588
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:29,279
providers and then the idea is once I

589
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:31,469
actually understand what the application

590
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,629
graph looks like I can model data flow

591
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:35,489
through it I can model permissions

592
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:37,379
required various nodes it can model

593
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:40,559
control requirements around image

594
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:42,958
scanning endpoint scanning I can

595
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,668
actually form a understanding of how

596
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:47,849
applications talk to each other

597
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:51,239
how they utilize various services and

598
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:55,079
it's you know there's actually a dearth

599
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:57,839
of tools out there to do that to end up

600
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:01,649
having to develop our own not our core

601
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:03,208
competency but it's it's one of the most

602
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:05,458
promising technologies were working on

603
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:06,689
right now and I think there was someone

604
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:11,099
behind you and we had something to share

605
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:13,949
as well yeah one project in particular

606
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:16,619
that seems interesting for a protection

607
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:20,009
approach with graphs is actually a cloud

608
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,299
mapper I think that's I think Scott

609
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:24,329
Piper actually spoke at blue hat about

610
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:26,849
it but it's similar to modeling like AWS

611
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:28,349
or cloud services that you detect policy

612
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:29,958
violations and things like that it seems

613
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:32,519
like a very promising approach towards

614
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:34,729
moving away from detection and response

615
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:38,460
and more towards actually proactively

616
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:42,710
finding those errors

617
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,710
and in the behind you event further also

618
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:52,749
and wouldn't it be wonderful if as your

619
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:54,669
security center did that for us

620
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:56,499
bloodhound does it better than the

621
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:58,809
internal Microsoft tools at this point

622
00:25:56,499 --> 00:26:01,090
but that's unbelievably useful for

623
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:04,299
everybody not many customers really know

624
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:08,428
where administrative access is and who

625
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:13,230
has it because it's always surprising

626
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:13,230
good thanks for sharing any other ideas

627
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,580
Grint one here in the front

628
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:31,140
yeah I we use graph ApS to consume

629
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:33,260
office 365 services specifically one of

630
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:38,940
the biggest uses is like a log ingestion

631
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:41,190
into sock and can have you been working

632
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,130
through a few things like ensuring the

633
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,620
logs get into the right State and at the

634
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:50,150
right time things like that so we have

635
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,149
provided that feedback to Microsoft

636
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:55,760
but it's been a good use of just to

637
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,899
integrate the office 365 services into

638
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,899
our alternate literature

639
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,559
okay well thanks everyone for sharing

640
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,360
your ideas I think that's a great start

641
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,910
to the discussions today thank you for

642
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,560
being here and Ron thanks for having me

643
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:15,790
as well all right thank you

644
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,790
[Applause]
