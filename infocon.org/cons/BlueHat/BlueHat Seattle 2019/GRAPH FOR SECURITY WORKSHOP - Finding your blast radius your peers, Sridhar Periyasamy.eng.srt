1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,250
I'd like to introduce our next speaker

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,048
Sridhar sridhar is a senior software

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,849
engineer in the azure security data

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,130
science team wherein he ships

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,139
high-performance scalable machine

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,770
learning solutions for other security

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:19,850
services everyone please welcome Sridhar

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:23,070
[Applause]

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,460
so there been a lot of talks about false

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,470
positives today right you know that's

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,390
that's definitely a problem that system

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,308
analyst faced and in mid-sized to large

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,430
enterprises and here are some numbers

14
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:38,968
actually you know a midsize company

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,980
spends around 21,000 hours per year you

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,140
know chasing false positives and that

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,599
costs them around like 1.3 million

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,800
dollars a year right so this is

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,239
definitely a problem and there are

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,910
multiple speakers who talked about this

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,699
today so what is the solution for that

22
00:00:52,910 --> 00:01:00,089
we want to enrich our security alerts

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,070
with additional metadata right that can

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,379
help you deal with possible false

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,520
positives increasing the alert fidelity

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,320
and rid like you know help you to

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:16,289
mitigate or resolve your alerts as well

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:19,439
in a quick manner right so this talk is

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,810
going to be about enrichment just what I

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,350
quickly go through our main goals like

31
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,880
on why we want to do enrichment the

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,509
first thing is like we want to reduce

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,060
false positive as I told before like we

34
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,820
want to make sure that we provide extra

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,170
context to your others so that you can

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,979
confidently say something is a false

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,750
positive or not and then also like the

38
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,659
second is like we want to reduce your

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,280
mean time to resolution of your alerts

40
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,490
to help your investigation and also like

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,020
to focus on investigations on on others

42
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:59,699
that are important not all alerts are

43
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:01,560
the same right so and also like give you

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,200
know help help increase the expertise of

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,570
the SEC upstream and make them think

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,598
like you know think in terms of graph

47
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,560
right so I know I know there's been a

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,200
lot of talks about like

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,450
the famous John Lambert blog as well

50
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,670
like the attackers thinkin crafty for

51
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,410
defenders think and list so we are

52
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,600
nudging we are with those enrichment our

53
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:27,250
goal is to nudge you know defenders to

54
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:31,060
think you know in terms of graph so

55
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:35,830
today we we do like in my team we do two

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:38,140
types of enrichment one is the peers the

57
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,989
peers are you know networks of users

58
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,929
within your organization right and the

59
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,370
blast radius for now I'm just going to

60
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,200
say it's a graphic it's a graph

61
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,519
representation of like all your assets

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,149
and entities and the relationships

63
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:57,459
between them in the cloud but we'll go

64
00:02:52,150 --> 00:03:00,730
in more detail about that okay first

65
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:03,100
appears so who I appears in your

66
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,530
organization like typically the people

67
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,269
you collaborate with and they're mostly

68
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,019
the people who may share access to

69
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:12,610
resources with right so we have defined

70
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,680
peers like this

71
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:20,769
to find your network of users within

72
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:22,930
your company the next thing is like does

73
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,670
since we are an agile security like you

74
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,799
know there's a sure has information

75
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:31,899
about your peers one of the things is

76
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,299
that you can use as the active directory

77
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,410
hierarchy information that is available

78
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,670
in agile but not a we found that we

79
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,560
actually did some investigation we found

80
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,260
that not a lot of companies set this up

81
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,000
in Azure in fact like only 40% of

82
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,298
companies have at least you know to any

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,370
person of users in their hierarchy and

84
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,840
also like guest users I don't know like

85
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,239
if you know about business to business

86
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,980
users btp users from other tenants they

87
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,310
are not usually part of an organization

88
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,980
so they get left out so we decided that

89
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,120
is not the right approach to take so at

90
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,760
least it won't solve all the scenarios

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,299
that we want to solve for the next is

92
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,310
groups I mean this support for groups in

93
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:16,780
almost every major directory offering

94
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:19,880
and I sure also has a hazard and a lot

95
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,200
of organization use groups

96
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,060
for you know for mailing list or

97
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,880
security groups for admin axes and all

98
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,080
these kind of things so groups are very

99
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,170
common so we wanted to take that

100
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:35,450
approach to find people who he appears

101
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:41,420
are now how do you find peers from your

102
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:43,490
group so like you know people with whom

103
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:48,680
you share common groups are most likely

104
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:50,720
to be appears right and also like we

105
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,490
take transitive membership into account

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,590
as your supports as your Active

107
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,360
Directory supposed nested groups so we

108
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,419
have to take transitive membership in

109
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,250
also into accounts and we ignore large

110
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,080
groups like if you belong to a large

111
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,150
group we the assumption is you're not

112
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,930
going to work closely with everyone in

113
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:11,330
that group like so the inverse is like

114
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,990
you know smaller the group more likely

115
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:17,270
you're like to collaborate with them so

116
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,520
these are assumptions like on how we can

117
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,830
find peers from from group membership

118
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,840
details right so what do we use we use

119
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,890
an algorithm called term frequency

120
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,369
inverse document frequency it is a text

121
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:36,890
processing algorithm so let's say that

122
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,410
you have millions of documents and you

123
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:42,260
want to search for the phrase the Lord

124
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,690
of the Rings right so terms like the and

125
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,000
off are like you know terms that occur

126
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:50,510
very frequently so documents with those

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,450
terms are actually prioritized less less

128
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,510
in your search results

129
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,909
whereas terms like rings and Lord you

130
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,190
know those terms are occur less

131
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,230
frequently and they are weighted more

132
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,030
and documents with those terms are

133
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,730
prioritized more in your search results

134
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:11,750
right this this is like really simple

135
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:13,580
text searching algorithm and we have the

136
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,180
a version of that is what we use for

137
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,640
calculating your the PS so we provide

138
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,250
normalized we get normalized weights for

139
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,510
groups smaller the group higher the

140
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,220
weight that's how we deal with it and

141
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:31,099
the output of this algorithm is like you

142
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,970
know a ranked set of peers

143
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,190
for for a user so just to give a little

144
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,820
bit go a little bit deep into it here

145
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:43,719
you can see a Venn diagram of of group

146
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,670
membership details really simple one so

147
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,830
who are the peers of the green user

148
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:54,110
right so like I'm hoping it's obvious

149
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,880
here but the closest peers are the

150
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,580
couple of blue users that are there

151
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,719
because they share all the three groups

152
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,120
with them okay who's gonna be the next

153
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,460
closest set of peers the red users they

154
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,450
share a couple of groups the orange

155
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,880
users as well the yellow users as well

156
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:16,010
but the way we rank peers is that like

157
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,010
we provide weight to smaller groups so

158
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,530
the next set of rank of peers would be

159
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,810
like the red red users because the

160
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,359
chroman groups are smaller right and

161
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,010
similarly like the next and the rank

162
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,490
would be the orange user because the

163
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,980
common groups are like smaller then the

164
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,550
yellow users so this is how we're going

165
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:41,990
to be ranked appears so how good is this

166
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:43,550
algorithm like I don't know like many

167
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,800
people at Microsoft can recognize these

168
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,040
names so this is the executive

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,290
leadership at Microsoft so this network

170
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,530
was created completely from group

171
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:58,190
membership nothing else right so as you

172
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:00,349
can see such as the CEO I picked up the

173
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,710
top five PS was sat here and then their

174
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,630
peers and formed created this network so

175
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:08,299
as you can see like Satya is a as a CEO

176
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:11,420
and he has like a me hood is a CFO Brad

177
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,770
Smith is the chief of legal affairs so

178
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:19,370
and Scott goos the head of cloud in

179
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:23,030
Microsoft so like so we were able to

180
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,770
find out like we were able to like say

181
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,380
that hey this algorithm works pretty

182
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,599
well with with the data at Microsoft

183
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,310
we're also trying to get feedback from

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,110
our customers regarding this but yeah

185
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,110
this this is completely based off like

186
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:40,880
the tf-idf algorithm okay now we have

187
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:42,640
calculated appears now what are the use

188
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,720
cases and security like

189
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,640
what do we do how can we use them let's

190
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,290
take that there's a user called John Doe

191
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,120
and this user and the purple nodes here

192
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,949
are users like there's a user called

193
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,270
John Doe or the purple nodes are users

194
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:03,400
and it's the Spear network like let's

195
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:09,520
say there's an other trigger due to some

196
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,930
anomaly activity from John right so as a

197
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,290
security analyst what do you do with

198
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:17,469
this one thing that we can help out with

199
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,969
is like if it is in line with the peer

200
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,880
activity if the peers have done the

201
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,100
similar same kind of activity then you

202
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,650
can suppress that as a false positive

203
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,480
it's that accesses you know usual for a

204
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,010
spear Network so there's probably

205
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,010
nothing maybe this is a low fidelity

206
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:38,140
alert and then you can suppress this

207
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:39,970
right if not if if if the axis is not in

208
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,310
line with peer activity then there is

209
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,790
something suspicious happening right so

210
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,989
in that case you can you can say that

211
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,500
this alert may alert needs further

212
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,030
investigation as well right so this is

213
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,520
like one of the use cases for peers I

214
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,650
mean they're a bunch of other and like

215
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,510
when you think about it like there was a

216
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:02,170
teammate who joined our team recently

217
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:04,569
and then see like as we do we do this

218
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,479
calculation every day for peer for peers

219
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,550
and then see Sharon Lee shows up like 1

220
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,620
XI 1 XI is on-boarded 2 with the new

221
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,540
hair document and everything and then

222
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,230
she shows up she shows up as my peer

223
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,520
like and we found out that she she one

224
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,560
of her peers we're members from the

225
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,140
older team from the from her older teams

226
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,180
and we were and we were able to make

227
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,980
sure that she was removed from our older

228
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,280
groups appropriately as well like there

229
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,580
are a lot of use cases for this but this

230
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,990
is like one example and like for

231
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,430
reducing false positive like there was

232
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:41,500
one of the points like one of the goals

233
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:46,180
for enrichment and next we're gonna move

234
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,490
on to blast radius so I think people are

235
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,650
talking like some of the speakers where

236
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,350
we were kind of like talking about

237
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:57,040
similar things but here we go

238
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,930
so what is blast radius so it is we are

239
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,649
defining it as privileges of an entity

240
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:05,050
in your cloud environment it must

241
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:08,980
include hidden and transitive privileges

242
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:11,019
as well I think an entity here could be

243
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,079
anything like a user or a group or even

244
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:16,600
a virtual machine in your cloud right

245
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,339
and and blast radius should be able to

246
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,589
answer the question what is the full

247
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,410
impact if an entity in your organization

248
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,550
is compromised right that is also is

249
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,399
important I mean that's the main one of

250
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,769
the main goals here and it helps to

251
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:33,279
think of last radius in you know in

252
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:34,959
directed graph you know the nodes can be

253
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,540
entities in your cloud the edges could

254
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,758
be relationships and there can be

255
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,019
multiple edges between nodes and the

256
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,550
edges can carry all kind of information

257
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,980
like what is the access level between

258
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,079
the or the type of access between the

259
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,730
entities when did they start when did

260
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:54,279
they end so that it can maintain history

261
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:56,199
also right so so yeah so directed graph

262
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,779
is like a really good way to represent

263
00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:03,219
blast radius so let's go a little bit

264
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:05,230
into it yeah this this is like you know

265
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,389
every cloud environment is complicated

266
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,699
like these are like a sample of services

267
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:11,529
that are offered in Azure right and they

268
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:13,689
all interact it interact with each other

269
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,790
in like complicated ways or not or I

270
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,800
would say not very obvious ways it's

271
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,599
easy to miss configure something or lose

272
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,130
track of something right and that's

273
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,490
where we want to help out like with our

274
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:30,080
security expertise as well so

275
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm just gonna give you an example here

276
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,899
this is a sample blast radius of a user

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,380
right so the purple node is a user the

278
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,240
green nodes are subscriptions a really

279
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,920
simple explanation I don't know like how

280
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,540
many people are familiar with Azure but

281
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,240
a really simple explanation is just a

282
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,490
collection of as you're agile resources

283
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,740
like VMs or storage accounts via Web

284
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,810
Services right so any permission you

285
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,730
have on a substrate in US on a

286
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,869
subscription it's actually propagates to

287
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,450
those resources as well the brown nodes

288
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,399
are groups groups are kind of you know

289
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,660
it's easy to configure all the team

290
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,160
members in a group and provide them

291
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,029
access to a subscription that's like a

292
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,459
standard way of doing things and yeah

293
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:15,980
I'll talk a little bit about service

294
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,209
principle but before that yeah let's

295
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,430
like you know this was the blast radius

296
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:22,680
about for the e for the user even like

297
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:26,540
I'm hoping it's obvious like you know

298
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,540
this person Jane Doe is a member of this

299
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,910
so this person Jane Doe is a member of

300
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,130
this group code hexa team and as a

301
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,180
result of that she gets permissions to a

302
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:42,180
bunch of these as your subscriptions so

303
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,130
I mean like the goal is to capture these

304
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:49,050
you know relationships in a graph manner

305
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:53,339
and a graph like a visualization so

306
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:56,640
let's say that the user you received an

307
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:59,040
alert for this user right and you want

308
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,420
to like I'm gonna talk about like you

309
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,699
can seed an alert and you want to you

310
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,069
know that this alert is positive right

311
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,680
and you want to like ReWalk some access

312
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,670
for this person right I'm talking about

313
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,900
your mitigation steps here right like so

314
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,969
let's say that you want to remove access

315
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,029
to this particular subscription so what

316
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,860
do you do it's this graph helps you to

317
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:24,500
find all the edges that go from that

318
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:26,640
user to that subscription and you can

319
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,050
make sure that you cut off all the edges

320
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,529
that need from that user to that

321
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:34,859
subscription so in this case you have to

322
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,480
cut off the access to this group this

323
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,589
group as well because there is like you

324
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,660
know a reader access

325
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:42,279
coming from this this group seems has

326
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,399
read of access on the subscription and

327
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,959
also one more one more group because

328
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,069
this group also has a read of access to

329
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,779
the subscription right so this is like

330
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:56,378
one example on how we can help you with

331
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:58,269
your mitigation the next example would

332
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:03,720
be service principle like those

333
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:06,040
principles are really useful in agile so

334
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,309
ok let me explain what service principle

335
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:11,559
is first they are just another identity

336
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:12,069
natural-like it also kind of like a user

337
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,420
right

338
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:15,099
we have credentials for a service

339
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,920
principle in fact you can have more than

340
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,589
one potential for a service principle

341
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,019
and you can it's primarily used for

342
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,939
automation for you can assign like you

343
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:28,089
know your service principles specific

344
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:29,410
privileges and you use it for automation

345
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:31,209
right you don't need to you don't want

346
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,410
to use user accounts for that you want

347
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:35,079
to you don't want to maintain passwords

348
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,399
for that click create accounts user

349
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,779
accounts and maintain passwords you know

350
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,149
those principles are really good way of

351
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:44,019
doing those automation or securing your

352
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:46,360
automation as well you know in principle

353
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:47,709
a service principle should never be

354
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,680
authenticated by it should be

355
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:52,059
authenticated by a user should not be

356
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,099
using the service principle you know it

357
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:55,600
should be completely automated right if

358
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,730
a service principle is getting up is

359
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,860
getting the auth token from your token

360
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,779
server it should be done it should be

361
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,610
from a script that is running inside

362
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:05,500
your automation you should in principle

363
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,389
yeah a user should not be using a

364
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,029
service principle of course that's

365
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:12,879
that's not the case and service

366
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:15,930
principles are also an interesting

367
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,930
attack vector for

368
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:23,420
for hackers right so remember that it's

369
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:26,479
just another identity in Azure so what

370
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,370
this means is when when a service

371
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,430
principal performs an activity in Azure

372
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,680
your Azure audit logs will have the will

373
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,000
have the identity as that Service

374
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,649
principal right it won't have the

375
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,870
identity of the user behind that service

376
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,310
principle right so they can easily mask

377
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,620
themselves if they get if they gain

378
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:47,810
access to a service principle as well so

379
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,730
so so having said that about service

380
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,529
principle it's it's important it's a pig

381
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,600
I've seen a lot of people like it's it's

382
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,610
an interesting you know entry point into

383
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,410
your into your cloud infrastructure I've

384
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,720
seen a lot of times where it has been

385
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:04,309
misconfigured or over provision with

386
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,230
credentials and all these things so in

387
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:09,910
this case let's say that you want to

388
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,910
revoke access to this particular

389
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:20,120
subscription right so of course fall for

390
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,859
that user you will have to remove access

391
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,989
to that group as well but you will have

392
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:26,240
to make sure that you remove access to

393
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,809
the service principle as well it's today

394
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,770
this is not very obvious and agile good

395
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:37,090
yeah and the other other aspects is like

396
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,870
you can you can we can pivot around a

397
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:42,970
subscription here here it shows the

398
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:46,340
blast radius of a user right so you can

399
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,750
pivot this graph around the subscription

400
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,520
and then you can see how many attack

401
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,080
points are there like what is the attack

402
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,049
surface of that subscription like how

403
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,189
many users can potentially I mean have

404
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:59,629
access to your subscription today right

405
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,000
so you can you can I mean that that

406
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,710
would be that would be useful for

407
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,450
compliance purposes for example I can

408
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,960
make sure that only a team should have

409
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,580
access to your subscriptions right so we

410
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,679
and you want to make sure that you cover

411
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,370
all kinds of entry points into your

412
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,650
subscription right so that's one of the

413
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,500
use case for this in the end like you

414
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,690
know we this graph our goal is to

415
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,690
provide this information in this graph

416
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,700
like that so that you can do your you

417
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,450
get one zero you're somewhat positive

418
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,580
about your

419
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,139
investigating your alert you can take

420
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,809
necessary mitigation of remediation

421
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:43,580
steps right so that is the main goal

422
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:46,039
here so just a small plug here both this

423
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,379
data is something that we do analytics

424
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,029
is something that we do today if you are

425
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,880
a natural customer if you use as your

426
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:56,809
sentinel it is available today just as a

427
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,760
private preview picture you can contact

428
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:00,850
me or actually it runs the PM for this

429
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:06,139
feature there you can contact me around

430
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:09,110
the way it works this as your sentinel

431
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:10,639
is built on top of like log analytics

432
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,820
log analytics is a columnar database

433
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:17,330
available in Azure so we push all this

434
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,620
data into log analytics and then you use

435
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,019
something what is called as a cousteau

436
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,760
query language to extract the data in

437
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:26,419
fact this visualization that I provided

438
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,429
in the previous slide is actually I the

439
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:30,649
way it is done is like we will retrieve

440
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:34,760
the data from the Crystal query in a

441
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:36,620
Jupiter notebook and then we display the

442
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,070
result of that query in a graph like

443
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,080
manner using some JavaScript libraries

444
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:45,769
so that Jupiter notebook is actually

445
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,740
available in a public github repo but I

446
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:50,059
forgot to include the link here but I'll

447
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,279
make sure I'll include the link before

448
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:57,678
this this slide these slides are

449
00:19:52,279 --> 00:20:00,590
uploaded to github as well so yeah yeah

450
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,539
so if you're interested in this yak you

451
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,889
can talk to rama or me meanwhile like

452
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:06,289
I'm at the end of the talk I know it's

453
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:09,549
been pretty quick but if you have any

454
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,549
questions yeah

455
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,420
does anyone have any questions

456
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,590
all right please join me in thanking

457
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:30,270
Street our

458
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:30,270
[Applause]
