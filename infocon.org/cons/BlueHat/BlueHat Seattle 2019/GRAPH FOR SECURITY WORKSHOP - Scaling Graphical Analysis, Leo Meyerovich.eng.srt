1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,500
up next is our next speaker dr. Leo

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,599
Mayer Maravich dr. Leo Maravich is the

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,480
founder of gravis tree which achieves

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,340
interactive visualizations of two to

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,130
five magnitudes more data and web

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,670
browsers by automatically exploiting

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,680
client and cloud GPU hardware previously

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,220
he researched parallel language and

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,960
browser design at UC Berkeley if you

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,900
need to show a lot of data in the

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,900
browser he's your guy welcome leo

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:41,160
yes thanks leo the founder of aircraft

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,540
this tree we even though we have graph

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,889
in our name I was actually more for the

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,589
art of graphics we really think about

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,840
what's technology 200x the investigation

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,910
experience but we end up doing a lot of

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,129
graph stuff and so I wanted to share how

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,019
we when we talk about graph kind of what

20
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,519
we're thinking about and especially once

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,620
we go into kind of bigger you know

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,480
enterprise federal you know and whether

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,218
it's like security fraud into human

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,419
trafficking like kind of what are the

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,280
scale issues and kind of what are

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,110
different not just performance but

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,409
actually of like overalls kind of skill

28
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,420
issues that we end up working with and

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,210
kind of tricks we've picked up but up

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,439
before going into that actually did want

31
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,140
to share something that's that's

32
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,970
happening so last month we actually

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,220
launched on Azure because now you could

34
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,810
just go to Azure spin up a GPU just like

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,039
as a normal virtual machine and do cool

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,979
stuff

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,110
so do quick demo of using us with

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,880
notebooks there and then actually I

39
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,380
realized I need power or this is gonna

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,380
be a very short talk

41
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,900
okay so plug is coming all right well

42
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,580
cross our fingers so meanwhile yeah so

43
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,560
what I want to share is a kind of a fun

44
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,750
example and then we'll get into this a

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,900
bit later but actually has a kind of a

46
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,990
quick who's in this room anybody here

47
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,000
use anything like Splunk or cousteau

48
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,979
elasticsearch okay so we do have

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,840
security people here good

50
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,490
and then next question anybody using

51
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,960
like jupiter notebooks anything like

52
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,160
that

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,758
so actually have with a few hands here

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,680
so what's kind of fun is whether you're

55
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:14,630
outside of Microsoft and using Sentinel

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,700
or you're inside of Microsoft and using

57
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,280
cousteau you can now do little things

58
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,700
like write acousto query oh thank you

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,700
appreciate it

60
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:28,880
we can now there we go

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,880
we can now in a Jupiter environment do

62
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,280
something like write acousto query or

63
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,959
spun query get bunch of about a bunch of

64
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,310
log hits and then what's fun is a

65
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,660
graphics tree somebody who's asking

66
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,320
about how can you go from logs to

67
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,480
hypergraphs

68
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,470
we have a little library called pie

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,510
graph this tree where you could just

70
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,700
take the data frame basically the data

71
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,429
table of stuff run it through the hyper

72
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,290
graph transform actually it's popped it

73
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,750
out in a new window here and then we get

74
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,700
like a fully we automate kind of

75
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,650
coloring interactivity getting time bars

76
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,720
all that fun stuff

77
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,549
this case we haven't really started

78
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,350
doing too much with it yet so I'll get

79
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,660
into that a little bit this fun example

80
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:09,109
is like maybe I just want to color the

81
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,390
events from the maps notion by time so

82
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,390
let me just color the edges based on you

83
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:17,750
know cold to hot something like that and

84
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,190
so we can now actually see actually I

85
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,600
did it how to call whatever but if I

86
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,880
want the most recent events I can you

87
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,519
know filter in requests or things like

88
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,549
that and it's in this interactive okay

89
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,440
so just if you want to you know play at

90
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:36,790
home or whatever that should be fun

91
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,790
so okay

92
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,578
what all right so I want to share a few

93
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,260
things today kind of some of the lessons

94
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:46,269
learned in building these systems and

95
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,040
and for scaling when we think about the

96
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,439
end-to-end investigation experience and

97
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,209
which I loosely define is somebody gets

98
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,680
like an alarm gets an email at the

99
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,139
ticket and then somehow it has to do

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,689
stuff and then finally close it we found

101
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:00,879
for using graph in these projects a few

102
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:03,700
areas of particular interest one is

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,768
information foraging so how do we build

104
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,030
out that context connected together how

105
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,889
do we you know then use things like

106
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,689
hyper graphs things like automation how

107
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,340
do we make that a very structured and

108
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:14,739
predictable process and kind of talk a

109
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,478
bit about how graph fits in once we do

110
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:18,009
have all of that data then there's how

111
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,539
do we make it useful so instead of being

112
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,759
pretty pictures or just a bunch of logs

113
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,620
how do we actually do sense making so

114
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,479
share it a little bit of some of the

115
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,560
ways we use graphs and actually we don't

116
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,849
use graphs on time there's actually Brad

117
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,380
races in the room I think if you want to

118
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:35,530
raise your hands so we actually do a lot

119
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,210
of work with Nvidia and so I'll talk a

120
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,669
bit about bringing GPU computing to

121
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,770
basically as if you could do Excel or

122
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:43,840
notebook so you can now do GPU computing

123
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,070
so talk a little bit about that and how

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,008
that's changing what we can do with

125
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,380
graph and then finally this give me a

126
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:54,159
short part of the project but if you're

127
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:57,729
doing your own graph projects a lot a

128
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:59,560
lot of projects fail not just graph

129
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,740
which is data project data is hard and

130
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,949
so when I chat a little bit about that

131
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,659
so let's start with the data foraging

132
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:10,690
problem which is pretty core to our jobs

133
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:13,990
as analysts and when a kind of where

134
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,370
graph fits in for that so Matt shared a

135
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,900
little bit about hyper graphs and

136
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,820
earlier and today we talked a little

137
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,739
about virtual graphs and so I want to

138
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,150
kind of maybe a slightly different spin

139
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,759
on how we think about and why we're

140
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,000
enthusiastic about that so now when we

141
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:31,960
think about digital systems we we have

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,930
tons of devices and those devices are

143
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,630
generating alerts so maybe we have our

144
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,699
customers have mobile phones maybe our

145
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,830
data center has servers virtual machines

146
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,570
we're tearing up tearing down likewise

147
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,090
we generally work at interesting scale

148
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,710
now so we might have you know a thousand

149
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,638
employees a hundred thousand employees a

150
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,378
billion users a million users

151
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,060
whatever we're getting all of their

152
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,800
digital activities like as soon as they

153
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,810
do anything with inside or outside our

154
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,150
company we're getting lots of logs on

155
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,460
them and lots of rich high fidelity

156
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,429
metadata around that type of stuff and

157
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,960
then what's also a little subtle and a

158
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,259
little different from how folks used to

159
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,620
talk about this stuff is now we have

160
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:14,509
api's so as analysts were expecting not

161
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,740
to just work over all that data but are

162
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:18,020
also expected to work with all those

163
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,460
api's and and so when we're building out

164
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,378
these systems I actually find that graph

165
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,989
to be pretty exciting here and so I'll

166
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:28,129
get into why graph of why a hyper graph

167
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,810
and virtual graph so on the virtual

168
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:32,419
graph what I find interesting about

169
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:36,139
what's going on here is actually graph

170
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:37,549
as our ability to model and interact

171
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,210
with these systems it gives us a lingua

172
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,500
franca for working with api's and so at

173
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,900
the interactivity layers to think

174
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,699
orchestration things like that as soon

175
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,099
as you have an entity on screen let's

176
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,469
say an IP address or a user account or a

177
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:53,270
firewall there's all sorts of things I

178
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:55,699
might want to do to start controlling

179
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,770
that virtual world I just described so

180
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,960
maybe I want to get more dots I want to

181
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,400
run a search maybe I want to drill in

182
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,839
I'm gonna pull in more data I want to

183
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,489
kind of pivot could I just click to

184
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,710
expand versus having to write a bunch of

185
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,360
weird-looking queries maybe I want to

186
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,409
sinkhole something I'm going to take a

187
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,770
command I'm gonna kick off an

188
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:13,969
orchestration kick fire off a ticket

189
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:17,270
anytime we have an entity and anytime we

190
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:18,830
have an API as a user I'd love to be

191
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,240
able to just directly interact with all

192
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,770
that stuff and we're increasingly

193
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,449
entering world where that stuff's

194
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,219
possible so actually the earlier talk

195
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,300
today about the end of a Microsoft

196
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,319
Enterprise graph is particularly

197
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,050
exciting to me again

198
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,960
and so one of our kind of missions is

199
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:37,099
could we make model entire system as one

200
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,378
uniform virtual graph so I'm gonna walk

201
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:42,438
through a little example where some of

202
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:44,060
these ideas come into play so and this

203
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,659
this may resonate with folks who've

204
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:50,000
worked in sort of stock or IR settings

205
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:53,149
or in the fraud world or elsewhere so

206
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,399
let's say you get a alert you pick up a

207
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:58,069
ticket whatever in this case it looks

208
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,349
like some IP address from some like I

209
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,689
guess a fire ID network monitor and then

210
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,128
we need and let's say this is a malware

211
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,869
all back and so we know that some

212
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:09,229
computers phoning home we have to

213
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:11,839
investigate so today what what this

214
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:15,169
might look like is okay so we look at

215
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:17,389
the fire ID network monitor we you know

216
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,308
pick up some metadata we know which

217
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,019
servers talking to so maybe and now we

218
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:24,259
jump to virustotal we pick up some more

219
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:25,429
metadata maybe we got some IOC s and we

220
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,989
want to see if anywhere else on our

221
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:30,979
network or that we saw the same file

222
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:33,740
hash you know what we actually have some

223
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:35,149
endpoint data as well like web endpoint

224
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,370
detection may be we have fire right host

225
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:41,000
and so we can check if any of the host

226
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,919
level we saw those files maybe while

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,569
silence still had all that VC money

228
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,519
you're running a POC and you still have

229
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:51,009
all those silence boxes so we're going

230
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:53,990
to check for the IOC there we actually

231
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:55,459
maybe you're more senior person or your

232
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,740
team so you actually know how to use the

233
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:59,029
hosts logs not just alerts and so you

234
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,170
actually know where to where to look in

235
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,970
the windows system so you're going to

236
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,490
check once you have those those are

237
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,759
going to check their reality is doing

238
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,259
all the maybe a lot of these you have

239
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:11,209
centralized into sims so in Creuset over

240
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:13,129
Splunk and so you already put them all

241
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,079
there and so now you start i'm doing the

242
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:17,449
same thing but in Splunk or in cousteau

243
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,219
you realize it's interesting and so now

244
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:20,329
you redo all that work because actually

245
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,220
instead of just for that week you have

246
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:24,410
to do it for like a one month or three

247
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,610
months because things escalated and and

248
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,259
so we're doing all this basically

249
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,230
accessing the api's and logs at that

250
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:31,370
level and this is kind of why you might

251
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,250
get a little nervous about your job

252
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,809
everyday you know and i think of when i

253
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,699
when i talk about foraging there's

254
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,379
actually several activities there the

255
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:43,809
first employed particular ones that i

256
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:46,160
find that to worth honing in on one is

257
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:48,110
some of those data sources I talked

258
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,600
about required you to know that data

259
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,120
source where in that data source which

260
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,250
field kind of actually how to use it

261
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,199
then you actually have to do the manual

262
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,300
work of jumping through those data

263
00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:01,878
sources or within one data source those

264
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,139
multiple tables and then somehow you

265
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,059
have to do the manual work of actually

266
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,889
stitching it together and a little bit

267
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:09,050
of like you know pull out folks mention

268
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:11,360
excel pull out the spreadsheet kind of

269
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,660
work through that to actually try to

270
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,889
figure out that story and then we have

271
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,610
to do this not just for the malware

272
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,260
callbacks

273
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,670
maybe it's fishing maybe it's a sequel

274
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,439
reach maybe it's like something like

275
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,729
that the struts server again like

276
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,860
whatever we have to do that for all the

277
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,209
different kinds of incidents and so

278
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,950
that's that's ends up being a big part

279
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:31,310
of our job and ends up being like a

280
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:33,260
pretty painful one and so if we listen

281
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,959
to vendors and you know I am the vendor

282
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,069
so you know grain of salt what we see is

283
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:41,779
we a lot of folks promising either

284
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,430
individual tools inside of our stock

285
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,170
will kind of solve entire classes of

286
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,550
problems but we have lots of these so we

287
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,560
have bunch of tools and then now people

288
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,089
are selling things like autonomous socks

289
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,430
in a box with my magical machine

290
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,200
learning and so you unify it and then

291
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,329
you just walk away and then this magical

292
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,190
black box takes takes and alerts and

293
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:00,109
sends out actions and then we as a job

294
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,300
we could just take the weekend and we're

295
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,130
done the reality is like the the sock

296
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,769
and box doesn't really exist or it

297
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,250
doesn't actually work as advertised and

298
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:12,170
so we're kind of what we've been

299
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,899
observing is a couple of basically three

300
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,880
things one is those products are

301
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:20,149
basically starting to do two things

302
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,220
one is about 10 years ago they started

303
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,959
all knitting logs and so we won them

304
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,519
like we won that fight now all the tools

305
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,680
will kind of give you back that data of

306
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,990
what they're doing and about for the

307
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,430
last five years or so folks have been

308
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,430
hard about vendors to actually expose

309
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,260
api's and and so what we've seen is that

310
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,510
several common abstractions of the merge

311
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,370
about how we work with security systems

312
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,569
like you know we have the data lakes and

313
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,370
where your machine learning thing maybe

314
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,600
we're a little forward-thinking or we

315
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,550
use sentinel and we actually have

316
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,589
orchestration but they actually all have

317
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,599
so we have these basic notions but we

318
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:53,240
also have kind of this more increasingly

319
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,829
common looking interface and so now as

320
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,570
somebody who wants to work with these

321
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:58,219
systems instead of working with them

322
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,380
individually we could start thinking hey

323
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,540
well for all those vlogs could I just

324
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,709
have one hyper graph to kind of describe

325
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,599
all the activity across my entire

326
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,550
enterprise and so whether it's at the

327
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,250
log level or at the lower level I just

328
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,170
have one uniform data model and two is

329
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,970
you know I don't want to have another

330
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,769
stupid data Lake project where I have

331
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,570
like yet another giant Hadoop cluster

332
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,370
and have another data duplicate maybe I

333
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,560
have a virtual notion of all of this

334
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,300
stuff and so I could reuse my existing

335
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,729
data silos and so I just have a virtual

336
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,290
graph over that and by the way a lot of

337
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,790
the things I deal with nowadays are like

338
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,360
like scoring algorithms and

339
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,339
orchestration systems and me

340
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,130
you know real-time EDR is something like

341
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,750
that like on the fly it's all API stuff

342
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:41,040
so now I actually have a way to interact

343
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,810
with those and so I'm finding a graph is

344
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,120
becoming sort of this lingua franca

345
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,000
again for whether we talk about hyper

346
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,940
graph for logs or virtual graph for API

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,010
and actually for really big logs it's

348
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,350
becoming a way for us to actually have a

349
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,560
uniform way of like a kind of a common

350
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,300
foundation of to build on so I was

351
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,969
interesting to speak after Matt an event

352
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,859
so we actually could go into a little

353
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,210
more nuance now because matt has already

354
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,680
introduced the notion of a hyper graph

355
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:14,220
so I'm gonna sure kind of a slightly

356
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,890
maybe extra nuance to web Matt was

357
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:21,920
saying on how will you think about hyper

358
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:24,449
graphs so it's kind of a quick demo

359
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,180
let's say we took that alert from before

360
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,200
and maybe we actually had to log lines

361
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,420
here where I'm just showing his kind of

362
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,730
Matt's notion let me flip the colors

363
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,479
just to increase the contrast maybe it's

364
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,480
a little more visible

365
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,230
so here I'm showing to law two loglines

366
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,609
I'm doing those JSON logs and then we

367
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,529
just picked out certain of those

368
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,420
entities as kind of on this case let's

369
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:48,639
say the IP address and the alert column

370
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,849
and said hey let's put the source IP in

371
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,639
the desc type ease on-screen when we say

372
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,620
hypergraph that that's really just about

373
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,759
the math or the underlying data model

374
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,490
but we can visualize it in different

375
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,529
ways and so the most kind of direct

376
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,149
mapping we could do something like in

377
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:05,860
orange we showed the individual blog

378
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:08,050
lines which we are the kind of a hyper

379
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,600
node or like the kind of the meta hyper

380
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,040
node and then we when we looked at the

381
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,420
log lines we could have extracted like

382
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,849
for example for this event we could have

383
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,709
extracted an alert maybe the source IP e

384
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,269
maybe the DES type e and then for the

385
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,160
second event the same thing we extract

386
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:22,750
the take the alert column we make it

387
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,579
made all those red and then we have the

388
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:28,720
source column the DES column and so and

389
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:30,790
so we can map them out this is useful at

390
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,139
the tool level and then as an analyst

391
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,279
this is useful when I really want to

392
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,839
drill in because if I was just gonna

393
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,360
look at this I could actually answer oh

394
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,649
how many events are there on screen well

395
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,720
there are two orange dots so I know

396
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,680
there are two events and I can start

397
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,970
answering questions about what's

398
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,319
actually going on by the way they're

399
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,680
related because they both have the same

400
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:49,870
blue and blue energy the blue device

401
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,939
extracted but there's no reason that

402
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,350
when we're consuming these things that

403
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,870
we cook we can't just change how they

404
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,819
look so I could take that that same same

405
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,050
graph if I could as soon as I have to

406
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:00,849
have a hyper graph that's like the most

407
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,829
like kind of zoomed in rich notion of

408
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,240
the data set but now I could do simpler

409
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:06,609
reviews like for example I say well

410
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,709
let's actually not show the event node

411
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,510
and then just like connect all of its

412
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,069
entities together so that first event we

413
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,380
just got rid of the orange node and

414
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:15,849
instead and instead of having everything

415
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,380
going through the orange node we can

416
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,240
just now directly connect them together

417
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,370
for us like oh that we just make that a

418
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,660
toggle like more I think the more

419
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,420
interesting thing to me as an analyst is

420
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,910
like I can kind of zoom out a little bit

421
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,380
I still want to differentiate events and

422
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,880
so I kind of lost that but now I could

423
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,860
do tricks like for example I could color

424
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,079
the edges based on the time what's like

425
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,399
cold too hot and so oh there's I don't

426
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,050
know exactly how many events really

427
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,910
happened here but I could say there's

428
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,800
something happened out the blue time

429
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,199
period and then later something over

430
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,969
here but actually the common actor was

431
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,000
was this guy down kind of inside it

432
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,689
inside of our perimeter

433
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,189
but out externally there were two others

434
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:53,480
and so hopefully this start gives you a

435
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:55,129
feel that we can actually model

436
00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:01,360
different kinds of data but actually

437
00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:04,750
have a good substrate underneath so no

438
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,750
let's jump

439
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,000
now one version of the world is whenever

440
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,490
you have an incident you do this

441
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,600
manually that we get an IP address begin

442
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,160
and alert and then we just start

443
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
pivoting around our hyper graph and then

444
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,360
hopefully we kind of understand what

445
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,830
happens that doesn't really scale that's

446
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,990
interesting for my hunter but as soon as

447
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,570
we do like tier 2 or anything like that

448
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,329
that doesn't really scale and so well

449
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,950
what we find is now that we have this

450
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:32,449
substrate we can actually start using

451
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,089
automation and actually making this

452
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,070
process more scalable so I'm going to

453
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:39,560
return to that same example so again we

454
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,180
have a malware callback and now we want

455
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,469
to kind of we as an analyst I know where

456
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,120
the bodies are buried so now I want to

457
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:48,769
kind of see if we can do that

458
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:51,110
the idea is wherever you normally work

459
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,880
so let's say you pick up your existing

460
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,070
dashboard you're out your Sentinel your

461
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,290
email the idea is whenever we want to

462
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,329
pick up an alert we want to do all of

463
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,269
that pivoting around that that described

464
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,890
in that it like the fire workflow but we

465
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,140
want to do automatically and over that

466
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,540
hydrograph I mean the over our virtual

467
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,300
graph so this case we have the malware

468
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,369
alert I want to click on the ID and as

469
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,928
soon as I click on it I jump into what I

470
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:17,030
was kind of interesting is I could

471
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,829
actually jump into a workflow that's

472
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,139
primed based off without whatever

473
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,178
investigative starting point I mean you

474
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,439
can have all sorts of workflow so in

475
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,179
this case for example when I clicked on

476
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,130
the link same thing as before we

477
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,929
synthesized that some starting point

478
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,090
let's say that Jason log that we clicked

479
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,350
on but then we have lots of different

480
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,909
steps and this could be things like

481
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,250
Splunk queries cousteau queries

482
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,470
virustotal queries all that stuff we can

483
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:44,030
actually have explicit instructions of

484
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:46,340
how to jump over the virtual graph we

485
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,340
hit the Run button each step runs we

486
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,629
find information so for example on this

487
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,030
graph what I might do is for example

488
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,040
let's recover recolor the the graph

489
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,190
based on the step that the the data came

490
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,190
in

491
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:06,800
so again we're gonna go cold too hot

492
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:08,420
here and so the initially we got a bit

493
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,070
of data here but near towards the end of

494
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,260
analysis for example as soon as we've

495
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,300
identified a particular laptop inside of

496
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,580
our perimeter we were actually later in

497
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,520
the analysis able to find later even

498
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,110
more information and underneath I ever

499
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,760
want to see was actually going on I can

500
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,250
actually jump in and see what a with

501
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,690
that pivot what that query was going

502
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,940
back to Matt's notion I might instead

503
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,460
wanted to understand what sort of the

504
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,140
temporal causality and so what I might

505
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,410
do is recolor based on time something

506
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,410
like that

507
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,020
so here what we actually found is indeed

508
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,020
actually the later a hotter time period

509
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,400
is from going from the laptops out alert

510
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,230
so this data is anonymized with actually

511
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,320
this is a real incident we can your same

512
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:56,640
kind of work in real time so going back

513
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:00,270
in context of kind of what I was trying

514
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,610
to get across here is like my senses as

515
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,210
more of that the security technologies

516
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:06,000
mature

517
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,100
just as how we switched to centralized

518
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,310
sims and being able to at least have

519
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,320
logs grabbable my we're starting to add

520
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,790
structure and uniformity and that as

521
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,530
benders kind of work together

522
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,409
my sense is being able to do relational

523
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:22,050
reasoning is we're kind of an sort of

524
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,570
that transition and and that actually

525
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,430
starts as I start adding in automation

526
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,189
and machine learning to however we work

527
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,080
as analysts I think that starts opening

528
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,020
certain interesting doors and when we

529
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,790
want to think about efficacy certain

530
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,150
certain interesting possibilities show

531
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,580
up

532
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,370
so as an analyst actually want to show

533
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,929
an example so remember one uh for one of

534
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,459
those pivots I hovered over and I was

535
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,990
able to kind of say oh here's the search

536
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,550
that for that pivot there's the

537
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,590
underlying search that ran over the

538
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,480
virtual graph what we're seeing up here

539
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,909
is actually real case when we're working

540
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,890
with a particular anti-human trafficking

541
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,230
group actually I'll talk about that

542
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,210
later we're one of those steps because

543
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,040
it came from the work flow the work flow

544
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,110
is actually able to generate a much

545
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,360
nastier looking query than I might have

546
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:09,240
normally done if I was just using a log

547
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,800
search tool directly so if in a log

548
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,780
search tool if I find some IPS or

549
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,580
whatever I might open a bunch of browser

550
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,649
tabs I might run a search for each IP

551
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,419
right but if I if a tool just

552
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,280
automatically pivots for me it could

553
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,010
actually generate all those queries for

554
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,570
me and that kind of stuff in theory you

555
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,010
know we are doing a log tool here you

556
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,139
can imagine doing a sequel tool you

557
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,400
could write some weird-looking join the

558
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,410
interesting thing is once we have a

559
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,420
uniform compute layer and we start

560
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,240
adding tooling around it for a graph

561
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,460
that's just a very intuitive natural

562
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,470
notion of expand write expand over the

563
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,840
virtual graph even if unda underlying

564
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,120
weird whatever database systems of the

565
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,980
day we're using make it gnarly that's

566
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,780
fine and so as an analyst is an

567
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,000
interesting value a value proposition

568
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,120
okay so through the automation I could

569
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,590
do

570
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
bunch of steps that means I could check

571
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,240
a bunch of data sources that I might

572
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,500
normally not do within each data source

573
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,790
we're actually going with a lot more

574
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,230
fidelity than I normally would I'm

575
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,240
actually checking a lot more of that

576
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,040
metadata that I normally maybe I just

577
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,830
look at file hash in the IP but now

578
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,290
maybe I do some extra correlative pieces

579
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,760
of evidence that I can go further on

580
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,770
because the Machine I'm having the

581
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,970
Machine do that for me and then finally

582
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,260
I'm actually doing that in less time

583
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,490
than I normally would have done all that

584
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,900
browsers are hopping and so this is like

585
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,520
there's an interesting value here and

586
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,590
then at the cost is actually fairly low

587
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,600
because what I've also demonstrated is

588
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:31,260
there's no reason to you know have to

589
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,240
write Python or PHP or c-sharp or

590
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,790
whatever you can just work in your query

591
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,140
language we do record and replay and it

592
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,389
just kind of works over your normal

593
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,330
system so I think things things are

594
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:45,570
getting a lot more accessible but then

595
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:47,340
when we jump to the team level I think

596
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,840
the value prop actually changes a bit so

597
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,220
everything I just said was more about as

598
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,080
a senior analysts how we might think

599
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,760
about it but then as we're trying to

600
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,740
work out the team level maybe you're a

601
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,760
manager and you're kind of responsible

602
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,740
at kind of how Matt was discussing

603
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,629
responsible for SLA is you're

604
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,370
responsible for team performance maybe

605
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,660
you have a remote team and you want to

606
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,919
talk about like kind of their best

607
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:09,600
practices things start shifting a bit

608
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,960
now that we have this ability to kind of

609
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,490
do these uniform investigations over our

610
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,140
kind of overall ecosystem we can

611
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,110
actually talk about steps investigative

612
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,450
steps we can start kind of breaking it

613
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,909
down to different kinds of coverage so

614
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,610
for example I talked about malware so if

615
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:29,160
we say if we take a perspective of

616
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,850
different kinds of investigations maybe

617
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,710
a team is 20% malware investigations 30%

618
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:37,110
phishing investigations and then now

619
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,670
they have to deal with maybe like multi

620
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,959
cloud like they know how to deal with

621
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,400
that as your account but they don't know

622
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,750
how to deal with their AWS account

623
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,580
whenever there's an alert on a tenant

624
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,350
now we can actually talk about well

625
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,840
whenever one of those alerts comes in

626
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,070
here's the best practice this isn't

627
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,540
gonna be the hundred percent of what you

628
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,220
have to do but here's like you know the

629
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,230
first 10 15 minutes these are all the

630
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,090
things that you should be checked so now

631
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,679
we can actually talk about having a kind

632
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,330
of a way a language and a structured

633
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,670
mechanism for teams to actually create

634
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,658
write out those plays at the same time

635
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,249
as we kind of go

636
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:07,570
deeper into the investigative team so

637
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,200
maybe we're a Tier three team we're a

638
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,149
hunter

639
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,440
maybe you're just really enthusiastic

640
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:13,330
about your job and you're always kind of

641
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,789
curious now we might want to do more

642
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,830
from the perspective of data so hey I

643
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:19,299
have you know actually what I hear a lot

644
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,649
is I talk to a team and the real like I

645
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:22,059
don't really know what to do with

646
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,320
Windows hosts logs there are a lot of

647
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:25,149
event codes and every year there are

648
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,340
more you know and sometimes there are

649
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:28,689
fewer and then change and then most of

650
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,099
the team doesn't doesn't have time and

651
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,210
knowledge to do it but all of a sudden

652
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,559
we can actually take four different kind

653
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,590
of data types we can talk about how do

654
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,869
we actually create at least for the 80%

655
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,609
case create kind of coverage for ways to

656
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:43,359
work over them and so once we start

657
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:44,710
getting the ability to again the virtual

658
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,330
graph and the hyper graph once we have

659
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,489
ability to talk about the logs and the

660
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,478
ability to talk about the api's we can

661
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:53,229
actually start stitching together

662
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:54,429
structured investigations over them this

663
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:56,289
conversation I'd love to have with

664
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:59,080
people after is like I what we're also

665
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:00,820
finding is somehow this one end of the

666
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,199
day this needs to some kind of a report

667
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,330
to management as well like the next

668
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,999
level of management where we want to say

669
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,320
well what is our SLA for our team and so

670
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:10,210
somehow there might be a notion of like

671
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,559
well if we have 80% coverage of our

672
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,149
different types of investigative

673
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,369
incidents at least for the common ones

674
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:18,158
at least we can say we will check most

675
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:20,320
of the the data sources for those most

676
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,659
common incidents the board should be

677
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,158
happy there was something like that and

678
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:26,349
that's an interesting question of like

679
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,429
you know is this about team burnout so

680
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:29,499
they're not doing though I kind of the

681
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:30,429
silly stuff is this about kind of

682
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:32,080
providing guarantees to other

683
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,340
organizations and I think there are a

684
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,199
lot of interesting things that start

685
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:41,559
opening up kind of taking a pause here

686
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,989
so I shared how we're doing the hyper

687
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,759
graph stuff in notebooks so you can if

688
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:47,649
I'm guessing about half the audience

689
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,389
hears and by Microsoft and might have

690
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:50,709
access to cousteau that means you could

691
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:52,928
do this stuff today

692
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,669
we're actually starting to focus on

693
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:56,409
working with the Sentinel folks around

694
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:58,509
providing the automation support and

695
00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:00,429
visual automation for that world that's

696
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:03,489
newer stuff so if you're interested in

697
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:04,389
that come up to me after our email and I

698
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:05,840
would actually love to work with you

699
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:10,340
guys on that or

700
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:13,850
men and women on that okay so let's make

701
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,250
graphs useful so here I'm showing two

702
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,409
other ways of looking at logs sometimes

703
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,920
actually even in the presentation I do

704
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:23,480
like to drill into logs sometimes I do

705
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,460
like to do things like bar charts

706
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,290
they're there times are useful but there

707
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,030
are other times probably like the two in

708
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:32,300
picture in here where they may not be

709
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,129
the tool for the job so I'm not like

710
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,930
some sort of graph extremists where like

711
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,660
all things have to be like you have to

712
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,940
do graph but there are places it fits

713
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:44,450
and I kind of want to share kind of some

714
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,040
of those interesting places so let's say

715
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,290
we take those same logs and then we

716
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,450
looked at these pictures here so if I

717
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,310
wanted to look at a logs and answer how

718
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,980
many IPS or what are the IPS in the

719
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,810
hashes and IO C's on involved a graphs

720
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,600
is actually pretty good for scoping so

721
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,919
that's okay we can do that I already

722
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,389
showed examples we want to look at

723
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,740
progression if I want to understand how

724
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,390
those same entities are doing things

725
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,810
over time graph actually does a pretty

726
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:10,550
decent job there to the tie with machine

727
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,899
learning actually gets pretty deep so if

728
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,389
you're doing stuff more on the models

729
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,440
side there I would actually that's again

730
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,210
another category let's just have a

731
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,730
discussion after but intuitively

732
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,200
patterns and outliers just pop but then

733
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,670
once you start overlaying things like

734
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,710
true positive fall sprouts that have

735
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,820
confidence scores it becomes really

736
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,990
interesting way to kind of call

737
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,610
attention and so on the right for

738
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,500
example who are kind of highlighting the

739
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,590
Crito of what an algorithm identified as

740
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,720
the critical players so graphs could do

741
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,720
some things that at the data level that

742
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,730
are hard in traditional goes so I want

743
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,290
to share a project that was actually

744
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,800
shown for the first time earlier this

745
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:47,540
week this is a collaboration with the

746
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,200
global emancipation Network which is

747
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,550
working on to stop modern-day slavery

748
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,260
it's actually partly sponsored by

749
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:57,409
Microsoft so thank you for the GPU hours

750
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,750
and Accenture did some of the work on

751
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,500
the I think tensorflow stuff then of

752
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,660
course we're doing some the

753
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,210
visualization automation so the basic

754
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,190
problem here is actually not very far

755
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,360
from our job as analysts so as an

756
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,830
analyst that might have a lot of logs

757
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,510
from a lot of data sources and I have to

758
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,949
sort of put together a picture of what

759
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,170
the bad bad people are doing in the

760
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,610
systems apparently you can actually do

761
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,330
the same thing to find modern-day teeth

762
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:22,030
cases of slavery so

763
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,919
what that looks like is their businesses

764
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,750
who actually have about registrations we

765
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,100
can actually have data like data indices

766
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,480
with all those businesses and all that

767
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,240
metadata just as how you might have an

768
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,100
asset inventory and then instead of

769
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,200
alerts it's a little trickier what we

770
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,459
actually have is online reviews so as

771
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,110
somebody goes to someplace like a

772
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,050
massage parlor they might talk about

773
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:44,080
what things they did and then things

774
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,550
they might use coded language so it's we

775
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,110
do have to do a bit of extraction and

776
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,790
reasoning about that data but actually

777
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,020
ends up very similar to alerts where all

778
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,909
of a sudden we start doing detections

779
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,940
and then we start kind of highlighting

780
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,620
interesting things about it and so I

781
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,570
thought this is an interesting case

782
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:02,679
study of where we like to use graph

783
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:04,899
visualization where we don't so what's

784
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,160
going on in the bottom is it's kind of

785
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,040
had the Machine when we're doing the

786
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,930
machine learning and kind of working how

787
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,940
the Machine understands that data set

788
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:17,230
for that particular algorithm so we had

789
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,660
all sorts of kind of things like for

790
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,490
example did certain words appear in the

791
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,810
reviews like how many times and some

792
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,580
machines and machine learning algorithms

793
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,379
generally really liked numbers and like

794
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,879
score ranges I think that's why we see a

795
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,960
lot of like self-driving cars because

796
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,640
that's just pixels those are just

797
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,620
numbers right so that's actually we're

798
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,020
pretty good at that stuff

799
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,399
and so one algorithm that's that's

800
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,170
emerge that's been kind of nice is

801
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,100
something called you map so actually

802
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,100
let's let's do this live

803
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:47,420
and so you map is actually works fairly

804
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,160
similarly underneath to have a lot of

805
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,540
modern machine learning algorithms work

806
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,350
it's a little different but it for our

807
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:56,420
purposes it's close enough and what's

808
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,639
going on here and this is actually real

809
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,950
data so I can't actually show drill down

810
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,190
too much for folks here I don't want to

811
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:07,190
be liable but what's going on here is in

812
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:08,390
gray is just basically the you map

813
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,760
algorithm looked at all those different

814
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,140
columns of interesting metadata and

815
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,990
think of your logs that might have lots

816
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,850
of metadata and we said hey a lot of

817
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,340
that stuff looked fine from the

818
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,740
perspective of this analysis but what we

819
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,570
found was there's actually two types of

820
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,390
results we might find one is there might

821
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:29,300
be basically maybe this massage parlor

822
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:31,340
is a brothel I'm gonna make know like

823
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,919
value judgment or moral judgment that

824
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,240
may or may not be illegal in different

825
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,750
jurisdictions in the US and so those are

826
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,250
all marked in pink but what I'm

827
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,290
completely not completely against is

828
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,840
actually straight on human trafficking

829
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:47,840
as an immigrant like I feel very

830
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,939
sensitive to that so that's actually in

831
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,080
green and what what we're doing here is

832
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:55,400
two things so ahead of time we rant

833
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,560
deep-learning tensorflow to just

834
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,480
basically try to classify hey what are

835
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,730
the like you know bad or bad or not like

836
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,800
you know gray pink or green but then

837
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,300
when we ran it through you map we we

838
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,129
actually use the very generic algorithm

839
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,020
and say hey without doing any of that

840
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,310
training stuff so imagine just ran a log

841
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,430
search and you just ran it through you

842
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:15,770
map what you know cluster it for me like

843
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,450
show me what there is to see and and

844
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,670
actually that's basically we're saying

845
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,650
is like how well did you map do relative

846
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,870
to fancy machine learning tensorflow

847
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:27,500
stuff and the result is actually kind of

848
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:29,870
surprising so for example all that gray

849
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,060
stuff yeah hey it's all neutral don't

850
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,350
look at it same same results but then

851
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,780
over here what we're starting to see is

852
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,850
more interesting stuff like oh I think

853
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,340
this is potential human trafficking

854
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:42,469
activity here that may kind of overlap

855
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,780
with just like normal brothel leave

856
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,130
stuff and so now we can actually as an

857
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,540
analyst that might want to start you

858
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,800
know clicking on the actual reviews

859
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,680
drilling in things like that and again I

860
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,610
can't actually do it in this talk so the

861
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,720
first thing that's kind of interesting

862
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,570
is that

863
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,070
in about one hour I had a very similar

864
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,389
result that's actually the real machine

865
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,189
learning team and about like I don't

866
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:02,330
know a month or two there's still

867
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,500
reasons you need to do the machine

868
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,939
learning stuff but just like as an

869
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,429
analyst trying to do stuff quickly I

870
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:10,669
think this is an interesting result

871
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:13,879
now you map still struggles though so

872
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:16,179
like remember I was talking about when

873
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:18,740
we're doing these kinds of algorithms

874
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:20,419
it's really just working on like number

875
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,620
numeric ranges like that's really what

876
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:23,929
its prime for it they're they're tricks

877
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,029
you can do to do things like I like

878
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:27,769
categorical values like you you know

879
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:29,210
maybe if it's a particular IP address

880
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:31,580
and make it a zero one stuff like that

881
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:33,590
but there you practice there are a lot

882
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,870
of issues so I want to take that same

883
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,899
data and now we're gonna do the graph

884
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,070
analytic perspective on it and so we're

885
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,539
actually gonna reuse the machine

886
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,450
learning results it's you know peanut

887
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:45,559
butter and jelly we're gonna pull out

888
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,000
using one of those workflows and this

889
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:49,100
actually we're just using Splunk queries

890
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,409
so you know imagine doing these in

891
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:54,519
cousteau we just searched for let's say

892
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:57,230
the 5 or 100 most suspicious companies

893
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,299
let's just for each one of those let's

894
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,669
do a second search to say hey show me

895
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:03,918
the the reviews on it show me maybe the

896
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,240
corporate metadata and then where it

897
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,379
gets interesting as an analyst I might

898
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,639
want to ask because I'm now I want to

899
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:08,178
find out I want to find like a crime

900
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:09,709
Network

901
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:12,559
like for that region of the world that

902
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:15,139
we're analyzing my guess is if there's

903
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,399
one group like people don't do crime in

904
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:18,080
isolation there's a support network

905
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,389
there's a supply chain so if you think

906
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,309
of like malware if you think of phishing

907
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:23,479
same thing there's a supply chain behind

908
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:25,039
that how this stuff happens they're

909
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,149
different actors doing different stuff

910
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,679
and so the guess was if we looked up all

911
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:32,750
those businesses and we just did a

912
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,789
second log search say hey what else is

913
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,070
there like and if we could just expand

914
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:38,509
on all of that metadata and then we can

915
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,590
actually see the result then maybe we

916
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:40,700
can start seeing things and that's

917
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,309
actually what happened

918
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,259
and so in green is just like geographic

919
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:49,519
information with interesting thing here

920
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:51,200
is in for example we start popping like

921
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,779
phone numbers and individuals and again

922
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,340
I'm not saying anybody here is actually

923
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:58,340
a known bad actor this is like an

924
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,168
ongoing thing but they're they're

925
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:03,049
involved in kind of a community that in

926
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:05,039
whatever way at a level where we have to

927
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:09,000
start thinking about it

928
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,769
and as a now from a graph clustering

929
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,480
view a little closer to an analyst might

930
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,590
really want now that we've done the data

931
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,440
foraging now I want to do two

932
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:18,059
sense-making ran the same thing I just

933
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,409
changed the layout from kind of like

934
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,639
showing how the invest on the

935
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:22,919
investigation frilled now I'm actually

936
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:24,330
doing based on clustering that same

937
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,269
exact result just a different layout

938
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:30,000
algorithm I have a guess that if I was

939
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:31,889
going to for example pick which group to

940
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,630
investigate I'll probably pick the

941
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:35,850
bigger one and then if I was gonna pick

942
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,649
a starting point I probably bet in blue

943
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,639
in this Center is an email address so I

944
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:41,250
probably trying to figure out things

945
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:45,299
about that email address and and again

946
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:47,100
like I think the you map stuff has value

947
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,440
there's a reason we do that with teams

948
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,418
but at the same time graph does actually

949
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,399
let us do things with that same data to

950
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:55,320
make other kinds of insights that may

951
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:57,539
not be as easy when we're just doing

952
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,830
this this world I'm so both have their

953
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,870
place but hopefully that's a nice

954
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:05,510
example of where one helps more than the

955
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,510
other okay

956
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,610
so I'm gonna share a couple more

957
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:16,190
examples here just using this stuff in

958
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:18,020
action then talk about GPUs so maybe

959
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,490
actually more just a flyby I thought was

960
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,759
interesting so Matt was sharing an

961
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:24,649
example where he was looking at hafer

962
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,659
out of all of the events or alerts that

963
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:30,850
the 365 team or SharePoint team was

964
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:33,320
seeing can we see those like as a map

965
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,580
and graphs tree was interesting as even

966
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,380
without doing the model work what we

967
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,060
could do for example is hey let's take

968
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,889
one week of all of our fire I host

969
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,989
alerts or let's take one week of all of

970
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,940
our filed incidents run the search query

971
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:45,439
against whatever our sim is and then

972
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,168
just mop out and map out the hyper graph

973
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,540
and see one week of activity and so here

974
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,549
what we're seeing is it's the hyper

975
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,980
graph view so for example we see in red

976
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,389
are individual imagine like a signature

977
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,280
or something like that like a like a

978
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,170
takeover and then in blue are the

979
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,330
devices and then each orange is like a

980
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,740
log line and so what we're seeing is for

981
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:07,640
example on the bottom right one alert

982
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:09,770
was hit by a lot of users this looks

983
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,000
like fewer users were hit by by this one

984
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,650
but there's actually a lot more log

985
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,230
activity and so we can actually do that

986
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,840
that kind of stuff pretty easily now and

987
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,400
so I kind of reinforcing that's pointing

988
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,550
like I we find that it's kind of an

989
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,130
interesting one to do with teams

990
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:28,970
okay I'm gonna shift gears a bit to GPU

991
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:31,460
land but to do that I think it's nice to

992
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,990
do an example so sometimes especially if

993
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,550
we're doing hunting or we're dealing

994
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,020
with a very intensive things or a longer

995
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,330
time scale we will have to deal with

996
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,740
more data that might be because we just

997
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,600
have a lot more rows because the longer

998
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,060
time period or maybe we have a lot more

999
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,970
metadata things like that what's

1000
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,500
interesting is often if you have good

1001
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,020
algorithms the algorithms will surface

1002
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,730
structure to that data so in this case

1003
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,520
for example we're looking at just

1004
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,200
internal network traffic again this is

1005
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,300
actually a simple view where nodes or

1006
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,490
devices and then each edge is just a

1007
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,950
very simple did one computer have a

1008
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,209
flagged communication with another so

1009
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,069
for example here we're seeing a lot of

1010
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,540
this computer who's triggering a lot of

1011
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:12,140
firewall alerts on the computers over

1012
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:14,210
here what's kind of nuts is first of all

1013
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,740
this is actually not a big graph to the

1014
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,050
graph of street team like to us this is

1015
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,069
like a nice medium-sized graph but what

1016
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,380
we're looking at here is like

1017
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:23,180
yeah all right 64,000 internal devices

1018
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,190
or entities or whatever returned from

1019
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,899
the search fine put it on screen

1020
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:30,290
I could cluster it I could play with it

1021
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:32,720
stuff like that and then I can actually

1022
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,070
interact with it so for example I'm

1023
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,980
noticing there's a lot of this gray

1024
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,840
noise that this this firewall stuff so

1025
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,470
like let me just get rid of all the the

1026
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,470
great stuff

1027
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,540
so I'm just gonna do more of like the

1028
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,799
second-tier stuff cuz I already

1029
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,900
understand that there's some certain

1030
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,340
firewall great stuff going on now I

1031
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,370
could just wreak lustre and it's just

1032
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,080
fast and now I can actually see there's

1033
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:58,810
actually other behavior going on so for

1034
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,460
example I don't know there's three other

1035
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,410
devices here it's mostly I don't know

1036
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,480
what yellow is yellow is some OS

1037
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,370
Microsoft log and then brown is some

1038
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,080
sort of net screen and so but I'm able

1039
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,279
to quickly do that kind of thing like as

1040
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,080
soon as I do the search I can actually

1041
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,110
make sense of the events and entities

1042
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,970
behind it and drill around underneath

1043
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,680
what's going on is we're using GPS in

1044
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,419
the browser just to visualize this sort

1045
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,129
of like a video game but actually on the

1046
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,300
back end we're using GPUs in the data

1047
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,280
center and we're actually running

1048
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,360
interactive analytics there and that's

1049
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,610
what I have actually wanted to talk

1050
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,500
about so let's jump ahead so an azure

1051
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,390
you can now like if you wanted to spin

1052
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,760
up like a node with about a hundred

1053
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,950
gigabytes of GPU memory and start doing

1054
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,900
crazy stuff with it that's gonna be

1055
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:43,720
about five dollars maybe more maybe less

1056
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:48,220
I don't know so instead of a coffee do

1057
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:50,259
crazy super computing and kind of a

1058
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,149
sense of what's going on there is it's

1059
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,680
still early so you're you're definitely

1060
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,630
on the edge if you're in this world to

1061
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,339
give us senses like a few years ago we

1062
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:00,010
did an NSF project where we introduced

1063
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:02,800
the notion of a GPU data frame Nvidia

1064
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,570
unsurprisingly might fit and then a

1065
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,010
bunch of startups started dealing stuff

1066
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,660
and now we're actually at the point

1067
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,160
where we have an open source ecosystem

1068
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,990
so you can actually just again just go

1069
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,210
and if you want to write sequel that

1070
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:15,759
runs on GPUs you want to do graph

1071
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:19,480
algorithms again Brad Rees I'd recommend

1072
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,890
you talk to you can actually go so as a

1073
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,870
couple examples here

1074
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,069
just to make a kind of concrete let's

1075
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:26,350
say you're in that notebook you're

1076
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,150
you're writing dowse queries

1077
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,710
even without graph like let's say we're

1078
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,600
just sitting that flow logs I might want

1079
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,130
to like bundle the logs based on the

1080
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,810
source and desk I keep Ayres and just

1081
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,430
see what's like for each one one's the

1082
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,620
most recent time to talked or something

1083
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,359
you could run that and what's

1084
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,920
interesting is if you're working on

1085
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,290
interesting scales if you do kind of a

1086
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,650
for example like a speed plus cost

1087
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:49,300
analysis versus a spark and the way I

1088
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,070
like to talk about it is on two

1089
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,680
dimensions one is let's say there's a

1090
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:56,280
hundred x differential so maybe where we

1091
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,470
use ten times we'd use 10 X to go ten

1092
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,240
faster than spark but and instead of

1093
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,069
going 100x faster than spark we just

1094
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,259
keep it at 10x faster than spark but

1095
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,790
then we also go ten times cheaper and so

1096
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,800
you kind of picked you want to be like

1097
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,240
you know 100 times cheaper but with the

1098
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,950
same result or do you want to go hundred

1099
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,180
times faster and pay the same amount

1100
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:14,339
that kind of stuff you can actually

1101
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,940
start playing with those things so

1102
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:20,760
that's about the data frames ku graph I

1103
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,940
found was interesting is that's kind of

1104
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,010
a newer part of the project but on a

1105
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,200
multi GPU scenario for example we could

1106
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:31,170
take and I think this is sixteen billion

1107
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,470
edges and then in 30 seconds you could

1108
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:36,360
do stuff with 16 billion edges which you

1109
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,520
could do bigger data sets but that

1110
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,470
should get a lot of people pretty far I

1111
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,190
normally work with more at the mid-level

1112
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:45,720
but I found that impressive

1113
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,160
I'm also have a shout-out to blazing

1114
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,839
sequel which is an open-source sequel

1115
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:54,870
that kind of plugs right into the system

1116
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:58,320
so all that to say is you can actually

1117
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:59,940
do GPUs now and I my claim is if you're

1118
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,440
doing more like hunting type stuff or

1119
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,180
larger scale stuff this is actually

1120
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,370
starting to become interesting to look

1121
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,399
at and lightweight methods are now

1122
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:11,069
practical last bit I just want to chat

1123
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,620
about this slide is I must made this

1124
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:15,780
entire section of the talk but I'm just

1125
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,430
having and I think is important recently

1126
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,500
at Gartner dinner analysis and this is

1127
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:21,089
the same people Gartner's the people who

1128
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,530
kind of like push all this technology

1129
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:25,290
and everybody so that's their job to

1130
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:27,570
push technology and yet what they did

1131
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:29,250
reuse analysis about 85% of data science

1132
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,750
projects fail this is just because it's

1133
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,080
hard it's like multidisciplinary data

1134
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,880
science data engineering all this stuff

1135
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,880
but it's still worth doing and the graph

1136
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,670
is it very much a data thing so we we

1137
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,730
need to have an answer to this and so

1138
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:47,370
over the years my team's kind of learned

1139
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:51,300
a few things one of the things I've

1140
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:53,100
learned is basically do things that you

1141
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,590
can be successful on like one day or one

1142
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,180
month and grow from that a lot of teams

1143
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,890
I'll talk to they'll say hey let's start

1144
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,109
by doing a big graph database initiative

1145
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:03,330
we'll do you know get our Kafka pipes

1146
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:05,640
all rerouted we'll stand up this giant

1147
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,470
multi like multi available so and like

1148
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,680
it's craft database do a bunch of data

1149
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,720
cleaning and then maybe in three months

1150
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,310
talk to users that's a project that's

1151
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,410
doomed to fail

1152
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,090
like maybe you're big enough and have

1153
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,730
enough money that you can work in a silo

1154
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:21,620
for two years but what we found is for

1155
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,740
most teams especially with like very

1156
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:26,540
political environments start small work

1157
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,640
with the users actually like if you can

1158
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,960
even solve one problem for one user you

1159
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,430
could then go to management and just

1160
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,780
like that's your slide that you can just

1161
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,549
like look no we were really doing

1162
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,680
valuable things here like you have that

1163
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:38,150
like defense ability another way of

1164
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,040
looking fairly similar thing as a

1165
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,830
cupcake principal even if ultimately

1166
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,210
you're going to a big thing don't start

1167
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,160
with building the multi-layer cake if

1168
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:51,680
you make one useful cupcake use that to

1169
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,029
grow and then finally kind of as a this

1170
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,390
is actually true of technology in

1171
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,120
general

1172
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:57,080
so if maybe a meta-level is there's

1173
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,850
something called the diffusion of

1174
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,680
innovation which is a study of how

1175
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,240
technology gets adopted in general and

1176
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,370
so for anybody here working at the edge

1177
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,240
it's a useful model of it was actually

1178
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,540
the data-driven

1179
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:11,149
for how the stuff works but basically to

1180
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,770
the tricks there one is low switching

1181
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,030
costs so one of the ways that blows

1182
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,350
switching costs for your teams is

1183
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,150
actually to have zero switching costs

1184
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:19,520
don't ask people to throw anything out

1185
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,020
you are not replacing a system so asking

1186
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,700
somebody to replace the sim with their

1187
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,950
gret with some graph database or to

1188
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:28,730
replace their existing like correlation

1189
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:30,890
tool with some new thing that's actually

1190
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,900
uh that's a political battle that if you

1191
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,000
can avoid it's it's you can actually

1192
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,990
want to do the same project but if you

1193
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,120
can phrase it has something that's

1194
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,709
augmenting that's all the sin oh there's

1195
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,020
something we couldn't do today we you

1196
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,010
can keep playing in the old sandpit but

1197
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,410
if you want the new toy

1198
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:47,900
pure it is that this actually helps a

1199
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:50,690
lot and then the other part is to start

1200
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,670
working with champions and by that what

1201
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,500
I mean is one is don't work with

1202
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,570
everybody just work with a few people

1203
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,770
hopefully their technical hopefully

1204
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,880
they're innovative hopefully they're

1205
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,870
patient they could deal with the hard

1206
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,760
edges because you're trying to do

1207
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,040
something new and if you're doing graph

1208
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,360
most people on your team have they're

1209
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,650
probably thinking about going to the bar

1210
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,180
on the weekend or seeing their kids

1211
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:11,450
they're not thinking about doing this

1212
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:13,310
stuff so I recommend if find that

1213
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,529
champion find out good like hey here's

1214
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,850
some use cases we can do and then and

1215
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,300
just build out from there build that

1216
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,850
cupcake

1217
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,600
everybody addicted to it grow up from

1218
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,730
there

1219
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:26,040
anyway that was a lot of stuff so

1220
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:27,450
scaling graph apparently is not you

1221
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,330
can't just solve it like in one

1222
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:31,890
afternoon but hopefully as that stuff

1223
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:33,330
scales and matures some of that stuff

1224
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,120
will stick with you if whether your user

1225
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:37,799
you're building systems some the ideas I

1226
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,810
think are very powerful here we're again

1227
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,550
virtual graph and hyper graph so we have

1228
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:43,110
a computational substrate we're can

1229
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:44,790
actually build really cool stuff

1230
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,890
we were already leveraging it a graph

1231
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,509
the street to make automation something

1232
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,160
that can happen during an investigation

1233
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:53,670
not just before an investigation

1234
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,529
I'm so happy to chat about that graph is

1235
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,810
can be useful I'll disagree a little bit

1236
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:59,880
with earlier speakers up just because

1237
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:03,120
tools think up big graphs doesn't mean

1238
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:07,020
that's inherent to the problem and then

1239
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:08,580
finally I think the GPU stuff is worth

1240
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,530
taking look at and then that really

1241
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,790
dovetails that second point is if you do

1242
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:14,220
want to live on the edge like that you

1243
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:16,440
should totally do it just might with a

1244
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,149
little bit of you know upfront planning

1245
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,390
you know updated projects or data

1246
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,130
projects the take care I think I'm right

1247
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,569
at the time on this one so I would

1248
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,380
recommend maybe just step out for

1249
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:30,140
questions or something

1250
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,240
have time for questions we'll stop here

1251
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,980
and take a 10-minute break but before

1252
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,910
that let's give a great round of

1253
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,910
applause to dr.
