00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,120
[Music]

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,120
so

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,189
[Music]

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,000
i can't believe that um thank you guys

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
all so much for for coming to watch me

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,880
talk um

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,519
i have a tendency to speak

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,359
very quickly

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,480
and i am acutely aware that i'm in a

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,280
room full of people who may not all be

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
native english speakers and my talk is

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,559
very long so instead of trying to

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,399
instead of blasting through everything

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
at light speed i'm probably just going

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,320
to end up skipping a couple of slides so

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
just stick with me and i'm going to put

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,199
the slides up at some point and if you

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,640
have any questions or if you want a copy

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,719
of the slide

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,000
any point

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,559
any point then just uh fire me a dm on

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,000
twitter so i'm gonna go ahead and get

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,239
started uh thanks again for coming thank

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,000
you guys all thanks microsoft for doing

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,840
this it's incredible uh let's get moving

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
so this talk is called staying ahead of

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,200
internet background exploitation um i'm

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,840
going to talk about what that means and

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,040
i'm going to talk a little bit about

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
kind of um basically

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,119
how we can think about this problem and

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,439
how we've been thinking about it so i'm

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,600
andrew morris i'm the founder and ceo at

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,759
gray noise i started grey noise about

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,080
five years ago and um i'm like

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,920
relentlessly obsessed with internet

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
background noise and what what we're

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,479
increasingly referring to as

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,520
internet background exploitation or

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,400
mass exploitation um i'm really really

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,399
excited to be here this is my twitter

42
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,320
and my email account you can email me

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
anytime i try to be as responsive as

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,280
humanly possible so um this is a really

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
quick agenda of what i'm going to go

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,320
over

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,640
basically you know what's the problem

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,280
internet mass exploitation of given

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
vulnerabilities uh what's the solution

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
to the problem or

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
gray noise and how we're thinking about

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,439
it and what are some of the really

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,759
interesting things that we've observed

54
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,919
in building and operating grey noise

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,680
over a period of time and then i'm going

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,599
to kind of sum it all up and

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,879
give you guys a couple of fun things

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,720
that you can play with for the next time

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
everything gets really haywire

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,400
and so with that um

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,040
the problem is basically uh

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,080
really bad vulnerabilities keep being

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,239
identified and disclosed in really

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,280
common internet facing software products

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,040
and everyone freaks out about it and it

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
is

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,480
something that used to happen every now

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,120
and then but it really does feel like

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
it's been happening more and more often

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,000
and so it feels like kind of every other

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,879
month

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,680
or

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,879
um

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,040
a really bad vulnerability is announced

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,680
and uh you know then everyone gets

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,480
really scared and there's a basically

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,879
there's a you know proof of concept and

78
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,599
it starts getting exploited at scale and

79
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,080
nobody knows what to do so um i've got a

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
stat here that's basically taken from a

81
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,640
organization that's older than five

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,959
years old that has basically indicated

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,120
look a lot of breaches that are

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
happening actually start with initial

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
access vectors of like scan and exploit

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
right actually one of the things that i

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,959
really love from that last talk that we

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,280
just heard is not every vulnerability

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,080
that is really really bad that's

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,319
exploited on people's networks is a zero

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,720
day and in fact the vast majority are

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
not old vulnerabilities are really

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,239
effective as well and i'm going to talk

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,879
about that here today as well so

95
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
basically this is a map of

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,120
celebrity vulnerabilities and kind of on

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,959
a timeline so

98
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,519
you don't even really have to

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,280
you don't even really have to

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,439
be an expert data scientist to look at

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,080
this and say like okay

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
um you know

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,159
there's a lot of them

104
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
right there there are a lot of them and

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
it seems like they are happening more

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,599
frequently now on one hand it could just

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,040
be that maybe

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,959
we're uh you know

109
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,478
marketing vulnerabilities a little bit

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,199
too much which is possible but on

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,840
another hand it's also possible that the

112
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
bad vulnerabilities that keep coming out

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,160
like the the shell shocks the the heart

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,720
bleeds the log4js things like that

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
it really is possible that these things

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
are just happening more frequently and

117
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
we're trying to kind of figure out why

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,360
that might be and what we can do about

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,280
it and why this is a hard problem so

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,479
my theory of why we're here

121
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,160
and this is a very complex problem um so

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,560
i don't want to grossly oversimplify it

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,919
but

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,880
the shortest most succinct answer that i

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,960
can give on why i think that we're here

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,840
is a combination of advances in

127
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,479
vulnerability research right people are

128
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,120
getting we the security community and

129
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
bad guys are getting better at basically

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,360
developing exploits for software and

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
developing exploits for the right

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,039
software and for software that is widely

133
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,800
deployed etc

134
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
and uh

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
software security isn't necessarily

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,000
catching up at the same rate but kind of

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
more to the point the attack surface is

138
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,479
just is increasing drastically we're

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
using more software in more computers in

140
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,479
more places and vulnerability research

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,960
is also getting more advanced as time

142
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,000
goes by

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,039
the second thing is this idea of mass

144
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,240
scanning or internet mass scanning is

145
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
evolving right so that means that the

146
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,720
internet is basically kind of it feels

147
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,199
like it's shrinking right um it's really

148
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
easy to mass scan the entire internet

149
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,080
very very quickly to find whether or not

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
a vulnerability in a piece of software

151
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,800
is running on or is running on a host or

152
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
rather to find

153
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,120
all of the hosts on the internet that a

154
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
vulnerability exists on and this is it's

155
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
not brand new it's just

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,479
we're all kind of learning this together

157
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,479
and the cat's out of the bag so

158
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,479
everyone kind of knows that this is the

159
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,240
case now so

160
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
because of reasons like the tooling

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
getting better you know z-map and

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
masculine those things have not been

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,919
around for that long i mean it's it's

164
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,800
relatively recent um ip addresses that

165
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
people are scanning the internet from

166
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,880
are actually you know they're recyclable

167
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
you can as soon as you burn an ip that

168
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
you've scanned the internet with you can

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
just get another one you know instantly

170
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,520
from a thousand different hosting

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,479
providers right and uh and the internet

172
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,479
is literally just faster

173
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,560
it's faster than it used to be so you

174
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
can blast more packets out onto the

175
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,639
internet so a combination of both of

176
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,120
these two things vulnerability research

177
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,319
evolving

178
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,280
mass mass scan technology evolving

179
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
a combination of those two different

180
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,440
things yields well mass exploitation is

181
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,199
now possible right so

182
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,120
back in the day

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,440
and again this is grossly oversimplified

184
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,919
this is kind of the way that we

185
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,240
a lot of people used to think about

186
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
uh used to think about hacking right uh

187
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,000
okay so i'm uh i'm a bad guy i want to

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
break into a network so this this is

189
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,160
again this is just a kind of anecdote

190
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,080
this is the way that we we like to we

191
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,599
teach these things or we talk about

192
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
these things as a bad guy i identify my

193
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,120
target

194
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,879
i'm going to scan them i'm going to

195
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,400
enumerate the software that's running on

196
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
their networks i'm going to enumerate

197
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
the different vulnerabilities

198
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,919
i'm going to find or identify the

199
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,080
vulnerabilities on my target i'm going

200
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
to exploit those vulnerabilities i'm

201
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
going to operate i'm going to do

202
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,000
whatever it is that i'm here to do move

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
from system to system find data blow

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,919
stuff up whatever it is that i want to

205
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,720
do and then you know i'm done i'm good

206
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,879
right and so now

207
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,039
we're starting to see this kind of new

208
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,280
sort of weird things start to happen

209
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,160
that

210
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,199
it's different instead of targeting one

211
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,720
organization and then doing everything

212
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
that you can to go after that bad guys

213
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,440
are increasingly starting with

214
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,840
a vulnerability so they start with a

215
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,319
vulnerability and then they say let me

216
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,319
scan the entire internet now i'm going

217
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,559
to scan the whole internet to find

218
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,719
how many vulnerable systems there are

219
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,958
out there right so now we have like a

220
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,000
smaller

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
a smaller pool now i'm going to

222
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,519
compromise as many hosts as i possibly

223
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,000
can i don't care where they are right it

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,920
doesn't matter to me i'll figure that

225
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,839
out later i'm going to compromise as

226
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,800
many systems as i possibly can and then

227
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,760
i'm going to deconflict my accesses and

228
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,600
what i mean by that is i'm basically

229
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
just going to figure out like okay how

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,680
many computers have i compromised where

231
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,399
are they what networks are they in do i

232
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,480
actually care about any of them maybe

233
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,360
i've got 10 10 compromised hosts in in

234
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,519
this network over here but i don't care

235
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,040
about that network and i've got one

236
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,240
really interesting one right here so

237
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
that's great i'm gonna i'm gonna look at

238
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,040
this one and then i'm either gonna like

239
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,399
i don't wanna say trade but i'm gonna

240
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,360
sell i'm going to hand off i'm going to

241
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
give those accesses to someone else

242
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
right and then

243
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
then i'm in i'm in a good place right

244
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,760
and so

245
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,800
this is

246
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
cause this causes

247
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,600
what

248
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
i'm referring to here as like threat

249
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,120
model creep

250
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
right when you're when you're trying to

251
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,279
build a threat model and again this is

252
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,760
grossly oversimplified but you basically

253
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,640
just say

254
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,839
an actor

255
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,040
does

256
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
an action to

257
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,959
an asset resulting in an outcome because

258
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,839
of whatever their motivation is right so

259
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,120
now you have to think about it a little

260
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
bit differently because now the asset is

261
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,680
like the whole internet right it's the

262
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,640
entire internet and uh that kind of

263
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
changes things for us a little bit that

264
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
means that we have to change the way

265
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,079
that we think that means that

266
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,079
we we kind of all have to care about

267
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,360
things that happen on the entire

268
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
internet and there are people that are

269
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,320
trying to find vulnerabilities in

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,800
software to just compromise as many

271
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
hosts as humanly possible and

272
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
they don't necessarily

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
care where they are you can kind of

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
still get owned right and this is

275
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
something that we're learning and

276
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
relearning kind of over and over and

277
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
over again in uh

278
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,720
so

279
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,399
i'm going to introduce this concept

280
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,519
called internet background noise if you

281
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,279
have

282
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,600
ever talked to me for any more than like

283
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,320
10 seconds i've probably started talking

284
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
to you internet background noise um

285
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
basically the internet's really really

286
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,560
really noisy okay so if you plug like

287
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
your laptop directly into a

288
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,240
uh into the wall and and you have no

289
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,399
router or firewall in between you and

290
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
the internet and you turn on wireshark

291
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
you're gonna see people scanning you

292
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,640
even though nobody even knows who you

293
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,079
are where you where

294
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,760
anything about you that's because the

295
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,680
internet is really noisy there's a lot

296
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,640
of internet background that is hitting

297
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,360
everybody all the time so

298
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
internet background noise is basically

299
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
caused for

300
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,399
it's caused by a number of different

301
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,720
things it's caused by people that are

302
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
credential stuffing bad guys doing a

303
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,480
bunch of bad stuff on as many hosts as

304
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
possible it's caused by good guys who

305
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
are scanning the internet for totally

306
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,880
legitimate and good reasons like google

307
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
crawling the internet for web content

308
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,560
you know showdan and census and other

309
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,000
different security companies that are

310
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,279
scanning the internet looking for

311
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,959
command and control servers or trying to

312
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,959
find vulnerabilities in their customers

313
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,880
hosts like attack surface monitoring

314
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
products things like that right but at

315
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
the end of the day the internet is just

316
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
really noisy this what i've got on the

317
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,680
stage behind me this is actually a

318
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,279
animated gif

319
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,160
of

320
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,279
one year's worth of actual internet

321
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,920
background noise um that that we've

322
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,120
collected at grey noise and each pixel

323
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,560
is an area of the internet and

324
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,880
the top right is the reserved ip space

325
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
so that's why it's completely blank it's

326
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
completely empty there are no routable

327
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,519
ips up there and

328
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
somewhere around like

329
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,920
here is census

330
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,360
and somewhere over there is showdam and

331
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
somewhere around this whole thing is a

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
lot of worms and

333
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,440
a lot of credential stuffers and bad

334
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,040
guys doing bad stuff right so uh

335
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
the internet's just really noisy it's

336
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,399
really really noisy and it makes this

337
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,480
difficult right

338
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,440
so again why is the internet so noisy

339
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,800
well

340
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,720
this is just a list of

341
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,399
some of the reasons why the internet is

342
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,880
so noisy and again none of these are bad

343
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,519
things this is a list of organizations

344
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,320
that scan the internet uh it's also a

345
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,079
list of organizations that scan the

346
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
internet that grey noise actually has

347
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,480
tags for that we monitor and that we've

348
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,120
attributed to their infrastructure so

349
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,880
i mean this is almost 100 right here um

350
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,760
and this is just a small fraction of a

351
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
representation of all internet

352
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,639
background noise right so this is very

353
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
very very very common there are probably

354
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,560
another five to ten of these companies

355
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
uh that get started and that start you

356
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,480
know scanning the internet pretty much

357
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,560
every year so it's internet's really

358
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,079
just kind of getting noisier and noisier

359
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,120
and noisier

360
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,920
so just to drive this point home a

361
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,800
little bit more um we lifted from a

362
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,440
paper that was written in 2004

363
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,160
an academic paper an academic computer

364
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,360
science paper and basically something

365
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
along the lines of

366
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,079
hey look with one ip address looking at

367
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,519
the internet

368
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,959
if someone's scanning the internet

369
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,600
really fast you know like sending 10

370
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,839
packets every second or scanning 10

371
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,959
addresses every second then uh which is

372
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,120
you know ludicrous it will take you you

373
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,440
know 13 years it'll take someone 13

374
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,680
years for them to see that

375
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,079
for someone else to observe

376
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,240
someone who is scanning the internet at

377
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,120
10

378
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,680
hosts per second or 10 packets per

379
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
second now this was lifted from a paper

380
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,320
that was written in 2004 okay

381
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,760
now in 2013 again this is 10 years ago

382
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
mass scan was released and it can scan

383
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,120
the entire internet in less than five

384
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
minutes blasting out 10 million packets

385
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,760
per second so we can already see that

386
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,160
like yeah scanning the internet's gotten

387
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,800
a lot easier and it's uh it's happening

388
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,240
much more quickly and it's it's much

389
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,680
noisier than we kind of expected that it

390
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,199
was going to be so

391
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,439
um

392
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,160
uh i am going to actually go into a lot

393
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,440
of these different vulnerabilities in

394
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,839
case studies like this um but at the end

395
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,120
of the day

396
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
a lot of the time as we're thinking

397
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,880
about mass exploitation

398
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
one of the first things that you're

399
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,839
really going to think about is like okay

400
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,959
uh well i'm a security person maybe i'm

401
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,440
a defender or maybe i am a systems

402
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,920
administrator and a new vulnerability

403
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
has been disclosed or i get a bulletin

404
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,760
or i'm talking to a friend and i find

405
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
out about some vulnerability uh this is

406
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
kind of a little flow chart that we put

407
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,000
together very basic flowchart of like

408
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,199
will a vulnerability be mass exploited

409
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
across the internet kind of like log for

410
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,600
j or something like that uh is the is

411
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,079
this thing going to be mass exploited

412
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,160
based on some set of criteria ask

413
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,920
yourself is the vulnerability remotely

414
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
exploitable yes

415
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,279
is there a public poc if there's a

416
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,199
public poc that's actually one of the

417
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,240
number one drivers that will lead to

418
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,079
mass exploitation of a vulnerability

419
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,079
because bad guys are actually kind of

420
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,279
lazy

421
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,600
they don't really want to do any work so

422
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
if you have if someone else has already

423
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,519
written the exploit they're really

424
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,199
really happy with that right so this is

425
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,199
one of the biggest drivers that leads to

426
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,880
to mass exploitation

427
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,040
is the software typically running on the

428
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
internet right if it's like a service

429
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,160
that's like running on a you know deeply

430
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,000
buried inside of people's networks then

431
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,920
no one's probably going to mass exploit

432
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
the given vulnerability out on the

433
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
entirety of the internet is the software

434
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
widely deployed um you know etc

435
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,600
um how does this kind of show up for for

436
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
different people how does this pain

437
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,680
manifest and who does it manifest too

438
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,800
well for network defenders uh they're

439
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,519
exhausted because this happens all the

440
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,600
time constantly and it's really

441
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,079
frustrating and security defenders are

442
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,160
basically always in a state of reacting

443
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,959
to the last really bad vulnerability um

444
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,199
cyber security vendors kind of feel like

445
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,279
idiots when this kind of thing happens

446
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,920
because their customers are asking them

447
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,600
hey uh what can you tell me about this

448
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,120
vulnerability do we care who's

449
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,480
exploiting it where's it coming from

450
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
right and security vendors are like i

451
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,959
have no idea like i don't have insight

452
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,880
into this and so they feel kind of

453
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,279
stupid right software vendors feel bad

454
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,959
because they're like oh god we're in the

455
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,199
news and no one's gonna trust our

456
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,839
software and this totally sucks and

457
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
hosting providers are just like please

458
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,959
stop compromising devices from our

459
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,000
networks or vice versa please stop

460
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,160
owning our customers devices this is

461
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,559
really bad and it's not good and i'm

462
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,799
tired of taking calls from the fbi and

463
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,880
i'm tired of responding to abuse

464
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,039
complaint reports

465
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,480
so

466
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
the problem is hard for a lot of

467
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,880
different reasons but it boils down to

468
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,000
um

469
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,679
in our opinion more or less people don't

470
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,679
people don't really trust data well

471
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,760
enough to want to make block decisions

472
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,120
when things like this are happening they

473
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
don't want to cut their users off and a

474
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,440
lot of people's data kind of sucks um

475
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
it's really hard to have something

476
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,679
useful to say when the kind of

477
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,200
when someone is exploiting a

478
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,799
vulnerability across the entire internet

479
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,880
that just was disclosed like a day ago

480
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
it's really hard to kind of like get

481
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,679
something out

482
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,520
at scale like very very quickly that's

483
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,480
useful to people um you don't want to

484
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,760
cause your customers to lose revenue you

485
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,440
don't want to cause anyone to lose money

486
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,559
and there's just a ton of different

487
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,039
scale issues so like

488
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,240
when a really big bad vulnerability

489
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
comes out the next time like how can we

490
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
really think about it well actually as

491
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,840
it turns out and i'm going to talk about

492
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,039
this more whack-a-mole style uh

493
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,600
short-term blocking of very small lists

494
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
of ip addresses very quickly actually

495
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,280
works a lot better than you would think

496
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,080
that it does um believe it or not uh it

497
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
sounds dumb it's pretty ugly and gross

498
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,240
but the results kind of speak for

499
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
themselves so i'm excited to share those

500
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,120
with you guys um

501
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,400
when uh the next log for j happens uh if

502
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
anyone in here was one of the people who

503
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,840
was scanning the internet exploiting or

504
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,960
like looking for log4j while log4j was

505
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,480
happening uh

506
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,360
don't do that again please i know you

507
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,919
mean well but it's not helping it

508
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,520
actually makes things a lot more

509
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,280
difficult for defenders so please uh

510
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,880
we need more collective defense more

511
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,160
information sharing if you have good

512
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,760
data the problem is most people don't

513
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,919
have good data and just if you're a

514
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,520
defender just assume that pretty much

515
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,559
anything that's sitting on your

516
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,799
perimeter on very little notice will

517
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,320
become very very very vulnerable and

518
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
threat model or architect around that

519
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,160
right but the long and the short is

520
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,520
really bad vulnerabilities are coming

521
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,840
out every other month and we can't stop

522
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,280
the vulnerabilities from existing

523
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,039
unfortunately there's nothing we can do

524
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,960
about that so we have to start thinking

525
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,480
about what we're going to do when it

526
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,200
happens next right so

527
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,600
now i'm going to talk a little bit about

528
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,360
grain noise right our solution to the

529
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
problem and just to be very very clear

530
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,400
everything that i'm going to talk about

531
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,799
today is like a free thing that you can

532
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,960
use right now i'm not here to push any

533
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,400
products on anybody this is all free

534
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
stuff so if

535
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
you if what i'm saying is interesting

536
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,720
you can literally pull your laptop out

537
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
right now and you can browse to

538
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
everything that i'm doing you don't have

539
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,200
to give us a dime so

540
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,360
our solution to the problem

541
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
basically

542
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,320
before

543
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,840
i go into

544
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,200
the way that we're doing it the prior

545
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,360
work that i want to talk about is again

546
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
there are a few different organizations

547
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,960
that are tracking exploitation of

548
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
vulnerabilities in the wild across the

549
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,720
internet grey noise is one of them but

550
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,039
rapid7s attacker kb is fantastic they

551
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,440
track over 600 different cves at scale

552
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
and the united states cesa

553
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
which the previous speakers were talking

554
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,480
about as well they track which

555
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,919
vulnerabilities are being exploited in

556
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,360
the wild and what you can do about it

557
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,840
etc um and so we're not the only people

558
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,559
who are doing this uh there are actually

559
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,919
more than one organization's and there's

560
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,600
a ton others that aren't on this list in

561
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
particular but we just wanted to capture

562
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,120
the ones that we have some statistics on

563
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,200
um just to make sure that that's that's

564
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
really clear

565
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,200
um

566
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,360
so

567
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,880
i don't know the absolute ultimate

568
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,760
solution to this problem but one way to

569
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,679
solve the problem is

570
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,960
let's deploy a gigantic network of

571
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
collector sensors or honey pots onto the

572
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,280
internet um so that when bad guys start

573
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
exploiting things at scale we can know

574
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
about it really quickly right and we

575
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,159
know where the attacks are coming from

576
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,880
so we can do something about it uh let's

577
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,120
listen to all of this internet

578
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
background mass exploitation that's

579
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,720
happening from a bunch of different

580
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,200
places and let's be able to make our

581
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
sensors look like whatever they have to

582
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
look like right let's make them be able

583
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,039
to look like an apache server make them

584
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,200
look like an exchange server make them

585
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
look like whatever we want right

586
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,919
then let's signature or fingerprint

587
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,799
every single exploit attempt that we see

588
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,679
at scale put them into a catalog right

589
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,000
that we're able to kind of track and

590
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,720
let's temporarily block bad guys from

591
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,520
people's networks uh before the attack

592
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
lands on the customer or the user's

593
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
perimeter right that's what we're going

594
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,280
to try to do that's what we do at

595
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,080
grainois and i'm going to talk about

596
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,159
kind of uh the results that we've seen

597
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,000
from doing this and and some of the

598
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
interesting takeaways that we've had um

599
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,880
really quick grey noise origin story i

600
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,240
started the company almost five years

601
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,640
ago um it all kind of got started i

602
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,799
started building the system uh a while

603
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
ago it basically got started because i

604
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,640
gave a talk at a conference uh in when i

605
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,320
was somehow

606
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,760
when i when i looked like that and uh

607
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,600
and i gave a talk at a conference about

608
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
like this distributed honeypot system

609
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,280
that i built in 2013 and um basically uh

610
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,799
it turned out that the problem that i

611
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,159
was trying to solve was like really

612
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,760
relevant to some really interesting

613
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,280
people and so they had a bunch of money

614
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,000
and they said hey we want to know who's

615
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,039
scanning

616
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,320
we want to know who's scanning the

617
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
internet for x y z different reason and

618
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,960
if you can figure out uh everyone who's

619
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,880
scanning the internet all the time then

620
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,039
uh that would be really useful and so i

621
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,640
basically became like really really

622
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,039
really obsessed with this problem and

623
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,400
i've been kind of working on solving it

624
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,280
for quite a while um but the the long

625
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,919
and the short of what grey noise is is

626
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,080
we operate thousands and thousands of

627
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,480
sensors across the internet um

628
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
it's centrally managed

629
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,720
we are distributed geographically so

630
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,799
that means we have sensors in

631
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,760
many many different countries uh we are

632
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
geographically we're we are

633
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,000
diverse in a provider and a data center

634
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
perspective so we have sensors that are

635
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
located in pretty much every provider

636
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,919
that you could possibly think of um

637
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,159
they pretend to be whatever we want them

638
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,760
to pretend to be so they can look like

639
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,120
anything we want them to look like

640
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,880
they're programmable and the hosts are

641
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,039
actually ephemeral which means you know

642
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,720
it's like snapchat it's there and then

643
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,480
it's gone and no one cares right so the

644
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,200
hosts go up they come down and uh and it

645
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,640
doesn't matter that's how it's supposed

646
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,520
to be

647
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
honestly the reason that the hosts are

648
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,640
ephemeral is because you have to assume

649
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,760
that people are going to figure out

650
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
where they are and so you want to switch

651
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,279
them up real quick right so nobody knows

652
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,279
where they are we process billions of

653
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,000
events every day um and that amount

654
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
increases over time as we've been adding

655
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,279
more hosts and as the internet has

656
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,039
actually been getting noisier

657
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,600
we tag the data which means we actually

658
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,720
write signatures on the expo our sensors

659
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,679
are seeing and we uh

660
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,600
we have a number of we support a number

661
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
of different use cases but i'm not going

662
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,640
to talk about most of those today i'm

663
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,600
only going to talk about one in

664
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
particular

665
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,880
uh opportunistic compromise mass

666
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
exploitation and we give away a bunch of

667
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,960
free stuff like a massive amount of free

668
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,760
stuff so check out our website like go

669
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
and look at it and it uh you know

670
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,840
there's uh you probably find some free

671
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
stuff for you you never have to talk to

672
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,039
us it's great um

673
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,480
i am probably gonna

674
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,279
breeze through a lot of the challenges

675
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,240
that we've experienced just because i

676
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
don't think i'm gonna have the time to

677
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
get into as much detail with these as

678
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
i'd like to but at a high level

679
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
there are many challenges these are some

680
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,279
of them

681
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,760
and uh the first one is like it's hard

682
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,679
to do this fast it's really hard to do

683
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,679
this fasted scale uh it's hard to stay

684
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,600
in front of exploits especially when you

685
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,159
don't really know what is what's coming

686
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,520
or what software's vulnerable or

687
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,159
something like that you only have a few

688
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,760
minutes to go from uh

689
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,159
a bad thing happening to one of your

690
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,039
sensors to making a blocked decision for

691
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,120
somebody else because that's about how

692
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,960
long it takes for someone to scan the

693
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,440
entire internet so you want to try to

694
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,480
block things before they land on your

695
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
customers right

696
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,600
it

697
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,480
is

698
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,360
not enough to be correct

699
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,559
and it is not enough to be fast you have

700
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,080
to be correct and fast and so that's one

701
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,279
of the reasons why this is really

702
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,360
challenging um if you're building a

703
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,640
system like this or if you're thinking

704
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,760
about this as well another one of the

705
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,159
problems that you're into is actually

706
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,080
selecting hosting providers like where

707
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,799
do you put the sensors um the really big

708
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,080
cloud hosting providers are actually

709
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
like super easy you can put stuff into

710
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,120
aws azure you know digitalocean google

711
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,240
cloud those are all pretty

712
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,840
straightforward uh it starts to get

713
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,320
really weird when you run out of major

714
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,080
cloud hosting providers and you have to

715
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,640
start putting things in like really

716
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,320
esoteric kind of

717
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
back alley

718
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,279
discount you know

719
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,840
joe's discount hosting provider or

720
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,159
whatever um especially because a lot of

721
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,320
the time those providers are using

722
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,240
websites that maybe aren't english or

723
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,120
hebrew so you kind of have to use a lot

724
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
of google translate to even figure out

725
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
how to spin up servers in their website

726
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,679
um automation maturity is basically just

727
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,679
referring to you know like how good are

728
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,159
their apis do they have apis if you have

729
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,919
to go to a website and like click on

730
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,679
stuff to make the servers go up it's not

731
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,679
gonna work so you're gonna need to to

732
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,840
have a good set of apis um cost

733
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,640
everything's expensive etc so um

734
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
basically like aws is really good for

735
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
kind of like back-end processing i

736
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
understand i'm at microsoft conference

737
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
right now um and uh you know api

738
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,440
deployment is basically something that

739
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,440
is challenging uh because you need to

740
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,799
make sure that

741
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,600
your

742
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,120
everything is basically

743
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,200
rock solid with ci and things like that

744
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,760
it's really expensive to

745
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,440
deploy a bunch of sensors at scale so

746
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,480
you have to make sure that you're only

747
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
deploying like the teeny tiniest ones

748
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,159
that you possibly can to save as much

749
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,279
money as humanly possible um etc

750
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,240
um

751
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,120
just the logistics of paying all of

752
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,279
these different providers is really

753
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,840
tricky it's actually a lot harder than

754
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,200
some of the technical challenges that

755
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,120
you run into some of the providers that

756
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,960
you're going to be looking at require

757
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,919
prepayment or they don't accept your

758
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,440
currency or something like that

759
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,640
sometimes they're going to require a

760
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
local phone number to a certain region

761
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,760
um

762
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,440
you're going to end up with a lot of

763
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,919
complexity if you try to do like a

764
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,320
one-to-many mapping with ip addresses to

765
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,120
hosts it's a nightmare and so it's it's

766
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,000
something that you're going to have to

767
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,039
think about if you try to solve this

768
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,159
we've certainly had to think about that

769
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,159
quite a lot um

770
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,880
and um basically like fortunately we're

771
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,559
in a place now where uh you know

772
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,159
infrastructure as code maturity has

773
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,760
really grown a lot so

774
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,039
you're gonna run into some automation

775
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,480
challenges we've certainly run into a

776
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,880
lot of these um and then again when

777
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,799
you're deploying tons and tons and tons

778
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,919
of sensors out onto the internet uh

779
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,279
across the globe from a bunch of

780
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,880
different places uh you're gonna run

781
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,880
into a lot of like latency issues while

782
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,559
you're doing this stuff like across the

783
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,320
entire planet if you're deploying a

784
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,799
thousand sensors from you know

785
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,760
our office to china uh then it's you

786
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,960
know it's probably you're gonna run into

787
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,080
some uh some some some latency issues

788
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,399
that are solvable if you have a complex

789
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,240
network of jump hosts but if you don't

790
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,159
have a complex network of jump hosts

791
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,840
then it's going to be challenging right

792
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,799
especially because you have to keep

793
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,880
these things going up and going down all

794
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,320
the time and then finally and this is

795
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,360
one of the things that i'm the most

796
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,760
excited about uh geographical challenges

797
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
right internet background noise and mass

798
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,080
exploitation are really really weird and

799
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,600
chaotic and one of the things that's

800
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,039
really interesting about internet

801
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,960
background noise and mass exploitation

802
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
is internet background noise is actually

803
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,559
different sometimes from country to

804
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,480
country believe it or not so that means

805
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,919
that internet background noise in the

806
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,760
united states is not the same as

807
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,919
internet background noise in china so if

808
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,600
you're trying to protect customers in

809
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,760
china then you need to have sensors in

810
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
china and so

811
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,320
you have to put a lot of effort and

812
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
energy into like really deploying

813
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,159
sensors to the right places into as many

814
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,559
countries as humanly possible um

815
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,520
and it's really hard to find hosting

816
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,399
providers in some areas of the world but

817
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,159
once you get it right and once you've

818
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,840
deployed to a certain critical mass of

819
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,440
geographic providers or a bunch of

820
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
countries you can do really cool stuff

821
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,120
like really interesting stuff like for

822
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,080
example you can really easily tell like

823
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
what's every ip address that's only

824
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,559
scanning israel's ip space

825
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,120
no other country all of israel's ip

826
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,480
space but they're never touching

827
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,960
anything else right so we did it and i

828
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,159
put up a link right here and you can

829
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,080
just download this file right now this

830
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,399
is every single ip address that is only

831
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,039
scanning israel's ip space for the last

832
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,200
month um and you can download this for

833
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,840
free uh it's unauthenticated uh you can

834
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
take a picture just in case you don't

835
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,799
get it but the file's not gonna go down

836
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,720
it's it's it's gonna stay up so if you

837
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,039
miss it then just send me a dm or ask

838
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,120
somebody else for it but um but it's

839
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,399
really cool so this is some of the stuff

840
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,080
that you can do once you have actually

841
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
properly deployed your sensors to as

842
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,159
many places as humanly possible but

843
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,240
again you're gonna run into a ton of

844
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,399
different challenges we've had a lot of

845
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,919
people freeze our accounts think that

846
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,360
we're committing fraud think that we're

847
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
doing crimes because we have hosts that

848
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,679
are going up and down all the time uh

849
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,440
and so people think that we're doing

850
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,320
some kind of scam stuff uh but we're not

851
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,000
and uh

852
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,480
the the last point in here of challenges

853
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,520
that you're going to run into in

854
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
operating a network kind of like grey

855
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,039
noise is um

856
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,880
people are gonna like people who are

857
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,480
scanning the internet or crawling the

858
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,640
internet are gonna lie to you

859
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,919
they're not gonna always tell you the

860
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,679
truth so sometimes

861
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,679
we've got two really easy examples right

862
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,200
here there was somebody that was

863
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,559
crawling the internet for env files so

864
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,880
you know n files or sensitive

865
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,360
environment configuration files and ssh

866
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,880
keys and they were

867
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,360
advertising themselves as census using

868
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,919
their same user agent and rdns that says

869
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,080
hey i'm census but it was definitely not

870
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
census and so fortunately we were like

871
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,720
hey we know that this is bs

872
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,799
so we tweeted about it and then this

873
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,480
googlebot pretender this is like a

874
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,640
classic people love scanning the

875
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,120
internet saying that they're googlebot

876
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,600
from like networks that google would

877
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
never scan the internet from and so we

878
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,360
see this a lot as well we actually

879
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,840
tagged this in grey noise right now

880
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,760
so this is something that uh that i've

881
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,600
always found to be really amusing most

882
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,799
of the time when people scan the

883
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,480
internet trying to look like someone

884
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,120
else you just make yourself stick out

885
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,159
even more um to the people who have been

886
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,399
doing it for a while so um that's

887
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,519
certainly something that i think is

888
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,640
really interesting um so with that um i

889
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,600
am going to spend probably the remainder

890
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,840
of this talk just talking about things

891
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,960
that we've actually seen or observed

892
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,159
with gray noise and uh and kind of

893
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,519
some of the interesting things that

894
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,000
we've seen as well as you know kind of

895
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,600
uh finally you know where i think we're

896
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,880
going to go or what we're going to do

897
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,440
about it so i would like to really

898
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,600
briefly cover a couple of these case

899
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,200
studies these are big name brands uh

900
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,279
branded celebrity vulnerabilities that

901
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,240
have been exploited uh at scale um and

902
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,159
i'm gonna try to just briefly touch on

903
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,919
each one of these four but like i

904
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,519
mentioned before we're seeing kind of

905
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,679
one of these every other month so

906
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,600
if uh if

907
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,919
if i miss any of these then don't worry

908
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,760
give it another month or two because

909
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,000
we'll we'll we'll see more

910
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,039
um i'm gonna first talk about the apache

911
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,320
patch reversal vulnerability here

912
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,360
briefly so really quickly um this was a

913
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,519
really interesting vulnerability in that

914
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,640
this was

915
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,200
this happened around october of this

916
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
past year

917
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,480
basically one of the things that was

918
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,080
interesting about this vulnerability is

919
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,519
that it was

920
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,000
patched internally right it was patched

921
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,640
in in apaches github or in their git

922
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,240
source code um

923
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,600
then so someone was aware of the

924
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,000
vulnerability then grey noise starts to

925
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,159
see people exploiting this vulnerability

926
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,200
right

927
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
the vulnerability hasn't even been

928
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,320
announced yet um uh or disclosed yet

929
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,039
then a proof of concept is released and

930
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,240
then

931
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,159
like magic

932
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,399
mass exploitation skyrockets for this

933
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,880
vulnerability right um so this is just a

934
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,159
really quick breakdown of the timeline

935
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,519
but this one was really interesting

936
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,600
because we actually saw we see this

937
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,039
stuff all the time we see new

938
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,880
vulnerabilities come out we write a

939
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,399
signature for it you know we make sure

940
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,840
that our sensors look like whatever we

941
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,240
catch up to it we we send out our tags

942
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,480
and and the rest is gravy this one was

943
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,679
really interesting because the

944
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,039
again the

945
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,679
exploitation started happening before

946
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,080
the the vulnerability was even announced

947
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,120
so that was really bizarre um but

948
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,200
basically this was uh this was one of

949
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,559
the ones that i thought was kind of one

950
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,080
of the more interesting vulnerabilities

951
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,640
that i've seen so i uh i thought that

952
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
was uh i thought that was worth starting

953
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,200
with the oh my god vulnerability was

954
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,199
also really interesting this one i'm

955
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,719
just gonna tell like a funny little

956
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,599
story it wasn't nearly as uh as

957
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,359
interesting from a timing perspective it

958
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,960
was just kind of like a fun thing that

959
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,879
happened so this vulnerability is

960
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,280
disclosed and grey noise starts seeing

961
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,639
exploitation of the vulnerability and um

962
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,800
the first thing that happened is that

963
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,159
we started you know we wrote our

964
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,839
signature for it we wrote our tag and

965
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,159
then we started to see exploitation of

966
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,639
it from a number of different ips

967
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,639
including some security companies which

968
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,960
we thought was really interesting so um

969
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,040
our uh one of our researchers was just

970
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,719
tweeting about the vulnerability and and

971
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,359
um and this guy is the ceo of a security

972
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,079
company who scans the internet so he was

973
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,399
like hey just so you guys know he told

974
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,800
us we're not actually checking for this

975
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,399
vulnerability so

976
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,119
please untag us from this right and so

977
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,280
there's just a small kind of interaction

978
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,359
and our researcher says hey look you

979
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,720
know we've actually been seeing it for

980
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,640
this time this is what we've seen like

981
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,920
let's let's chat about this really

982
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,480
quickly and uh and the company replied

983
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,800
to us again like no no no like like

984
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,359
we're checking for this thing but we're

985
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,760
not exploiting this vulnerability and we

986
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,040
talked to this team back and forth a

987
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,119
couple of times and it actually turned

988
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,280
out that they were actually checking for

989
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,440
that vulnerability like like months and

990
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,119
months and months before anyone even

991
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,160
knew that it existed um and so it was it

992
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,440
was really interesting and we were able

993
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,119
to kind of derive this just from looking

994
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,400
at the data and our research team was

995
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
like really really on top of it it was

996
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,760
really really exciting so it was pretty

997
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,079
cool but it was like accidental

998
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,000
exploitation of an interesting

999
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,839
vulnerability like four months before

1000
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,400
anyone even knew that it was a thing so

1001
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,680
we thought that was pretty interesting

1002
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,920
and i wanted to highlight that um the

1003
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
confluence vulnerability that came out

1004
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,280
last year was really interesting um for

1005
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,640
a few different reasons it followed the

1006
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,240
kind of similar pattern that we've seen

1007
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,560
before vulnerability is announced

1008
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,200
everybody freaks out uh exploitation

1009
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,280
starts to happen and one of the things

1010
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,320
that was interesting about this

1011
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,800
vulnerability was um rob graham who

1012
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,920
wrote math scan um he wrote you know if

1013
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,599
you know if we live in a time in mass

1014
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,440
scan where if you haven't patched in the

1015
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,520
time in between a vulnerability coming

1016
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,200
out and uh

1017
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,880
in in one hour then you're going to be

1018
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,400
owned and a lot of people actually kind

1019
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,160
of like yelled at rob for that they're

1020
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
like hey you're being kind of crazy but

1021
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
but it was true it was actually

1022
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,359
literally true within several hours of

1023
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,599
this particular vulnerability act coming

1024
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,920
out we started to see exploitation of

1025
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,240
this vulnerability because uh somebody

1026
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,119
had opened up a pull request to nuclei

1027
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,400
to project discovery and it became zero

1028
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,800
cost virtually zero cost to exploit this

1029
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,240
vulnerability at scale like within hours

1030
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,400
and we have everything was lined up this

1031
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,480
way so it was um

1032
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,320
it was really really interesting so this

1033
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,400
this one i found to be particularly

1034
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,079
interesting because

1035
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,160
most of the time when security people

1036
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,400
say that everything is really bad and on

1037
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,079
fire they're just kind of making stuff

1038
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,920
up to sell products to you

1039
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,720
but

1040
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,920
this time

1041
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,160
this time it was actually literally true

1042
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,720
um and so that really like blew my mind

1043
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,920
and i thought that was really really

1044
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,160
interesting and then finally of course

1045
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,720
um i'm going to briefly talk about log4j

1046
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,839
um

1047
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,800
the really funny thing about log4j was

1048
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,520
that the very first big wave of

1049
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
exploitation that hit everybody on the

1050
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,240
internet here um came from exclusively

1051
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,640
tor exit nodes which we thought was

1052
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,720
really fascinating because from our

1053
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,520
perspective we know how expensive it can

1054
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
be to expand the internet and when i say

1055
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,480
expensive i mean complexity bandwidth

1056
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,680
you know effort etc so for someone to do

1057
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,880
that

1058
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
through tor

1059
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,280
was

1060
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,040
really interesting not necessarily the

1061
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,800
scanning portion but the exploitation

1062
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,839
portion at scale to virtually the entire

1063
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,320
internet and um this first exploit

1064
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,200
payload for log4j exploiting it at scale

1065
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,400
through tor

1066
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,880
wasn't particularly sophisticated in the

1067
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,240
payload itself it was kind of

1068
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,839
interesting because of the way that they

1069
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,480
did it um but

1070
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,400
it uh you know attempted to exploit this

1071
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,920
vulnerability through tor which we found

1072
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,880
interesting

1073
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,960
at the beginning almost all of the

1074
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,599
exploitation that was happening was just

1075
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,480
people cramming the log for j string

1076
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,160
into as many different fields as

1077
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,240
possible and then saying like okay let's

1078
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,760
see what happens like let's just see if

1079
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,079
we get any shells and

1080
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,520
and that continued for the first few

1081
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,440
days and then actually over the weekend

1082
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,000
we started to see product specific

1083
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,320
payloads that started to come out where

1084
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,839
security researchers vulnerability

1085
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,480
researchers etc had actually started

1086
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,960
developing custom payloads for different

1087
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,040
secure different products that were

1088
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,200
running java so that they knew that they

1089
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,480
would get you know successful

1090
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,280
exploitation um and so this one was was

1091
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,200
really really interesting the last

1092
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,040
reason why log4j was so particularly

1093
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,839
interesting is

1094
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,400
because you can't really check the

1095
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,280
existence of this vulnerability without

1096
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,640
exploiting it you can't really scan for

1097
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
it so what's interesting is like at gray

1098
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,359
noise we know that look checking for the

1099
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,960
existence of a vulnerability on the

1100
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,880
internet um and exploiting the

1101
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,800
vulnerability are not the same thing

1102
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,240
scanning for a vulnerability and

1103
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,680
exploiting a vulnerability are not the

1104
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,200
same thing except sometimes they are the

1105
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,359
same thing right and this was one of

1106
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,440
those times that it was the same thing

1107
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,520
and that makes life really kind of

1108
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,720
complicated um and so the takeaway here

1109
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,200
that i have from this is look sometimes

1110
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
security researchers and security

1111
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,599
companies who are exploiting vulners at

1112
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,560
scale

1113
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,440
they have great intentions but it does

1114
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,800
actually just make things much more

1115
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,480
difficult for everybody because nobody

1116
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,160
really knows that you have good

1117
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,760
intention and it's very difficult to

1118
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,240
differentiate you from the other

1119
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,800
thousand bad guys who are doing that all

1120
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,240
the time uh so it's uh less helpful than

1121
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,520
you might think

1122
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,920
so um this is just a really quick

1123
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
snapshot of kind of some of the stats

1124
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,680
that we're seeing of the amount of

1125
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,240
unique ip addresses that are always

1126
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,760
either scanning the internet or

1127
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,079
attempting to exploit hosts at scale

1128
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,920
this is on a monthly basis so you can

1129
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,200
see that we'll go through we've seen a

1130
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,040
million ip addresses this month million

1131
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,839
ip address this month and um

1132
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,359
this is interesting because this

1133
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,280
basically tells us a couple of different

1134
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,400
things but

1135
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,920
one of the different things that it

1136
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,200
tells us that's really interesting is

1137
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,359
that there's this concept of a noise

1138
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,560
floor

1139
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,359
right

1140
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,720
the noise floor is basically this kind

1141
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,440
of

1142
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,319
it never really goes below like a couple

1143
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,480
hundred thousand ip addresses there's

1144
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,000
always at least a couple hundred

1145
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,280
thousand ip addresses scanning the

1146
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,280
internet like all the time

1147
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,319
so

1148
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,400
uh we actually spent a little bit of

1149
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,560
time trying to quantify what is the

1150
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,240
noise floor actually like like how much

1151
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,720
overlap is there etc and where we ended

1152
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,680
up is that this shook out really really

1153
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,160
interestingly but basically on a daily

1154
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,240
basis

1155
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,680
25

1156
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,200
of the ip addresses that are scanning

1157
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,960
the internet or exploiting hosts on the

1158
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,119
internet today are brand new

1159
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,359
and 75 of them are the same from

1160
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,440
yesterday and then the next day it's the

1161
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,400
same thing you lose another 25 percent

1162
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,240
you have a new 25

1163
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,319
and then 75 are the same ones from the

1164
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,800
day before and so with this logic you

1165
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,640
can kind of figure out that like after

1166
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,359
four days the entire list of all

1167
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,200
internet background noise is effectively

1168
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,760
useless right so you kind of have to be

1169
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,119
doing this all the time the data is

1170
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,640
just very very rapid um you can't think

1171
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,680
about it the same way that you would

1172
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,599
think about maybe threat intelligence or

1173
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,880
something like that which might be you

1174
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,359
know useful for a long time the the raw

1175
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,400
data under the hood is very very rapid

1176
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,359
and it changes very quickly right so

1177
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,079
again the the long and the short is that

1178
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,200
about

1179
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,119
about 75

1180
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,280
of uh every ip address that's scanning

1181
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,359
the internet or exploiting hosts out on

1182
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,680
the internet is uh the same from

1183
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
yesterday whereas 25

1184
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,000
are brand new every day day over day

1185
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,760
over day which is uh which is

1186
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,359
interesting

1187
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,119
and then finally um i just want to talk

1188
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,960
about some like other weird stuff that

1189
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,680
we've seen at grain noise um

1190
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,319
we've been seeing a lot of these spoofed

1191
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,240
noise storms which is when someone is

1192
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,960
blasting the internet either

1193
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,760
some of it or all of it with

1194
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,480
spoofed packets from other places that

1195
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,640
they never received their responses to

1196
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,160
and we're actually seeing a really

1197
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,760
really really bad noise storm right now

1198
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,160
specifically in ukraine so someone is

1199
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,079
actually blasting ip addresses in

1200
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,760
ukraine um

1201
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,359
with uh spoofed packets that maybe have

1202
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,640
something interesting in them maybe they

1203
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,280
don't it's unclear why this is happening

1204
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,599
by the way this first one here spoof

1205
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,440
noise storms um if anybody here at all

1206
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,000
has seen this same thing or experienced

1207
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
this then please come and talk to me at

1208
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,720
any point this is like my white whale

1209
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,640
like i've been chasing after this

1210
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,319
problem for so long and i have no idea

1211
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,040
why it's happening the first time we saw

1212
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,680
this particular phenomenon at grey noise

1213
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,000
what it happened to be the same day

1214
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,240
that the united states um military um

1215
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,640
killed soleimani the iranian general so

1216
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,960
it was um it was really interesting that

1217
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,280
it started right then and then

1218
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,119
periodically we see it go down and then

1219
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,880
come back up i'm not willing to say that

1220
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,640
it's always the same people because you

1221
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
just really have no idea but for some

1222
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,359
reason every couple of days or weeks for

1223
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,200
the last kind of two years we will

1224
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,839
periodically see someone blasting the

1225
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,720
internet with spoofed packets that are

1226
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,680
never

1227
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,760
with responses that are never received

1228
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,960
and we haven't really figured out

1229
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
exactly why but it keeps happening and

1230
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,480
it's really interesting um you know

1231
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,079
bad guys like acting like security

1232
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,280
companies who scan the internet they

1233
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,599
masquerade i talked about this um one of

1234
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,480
the really interesting things that

1235
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,800
you're going to see is that you're

1236
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
when as we deploy lots of sensors to

1237
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,560
different hosting providers in different

1238
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,880
countries um we notice patterns where

1239
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,480
sometimes people are actually blocking

1240
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,200
things upstream of us and we notice that

1241
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,960
right because like oh hey why didn't we

1242
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,520
get this packet that every other host

1243
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,160
got it's because your your hosting

1244
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,359
provider blocks that traffic or perhaps

1245
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,040
the country blocks that traffic on the

1246
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,599
way in which is possible right

1247
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,359
and uh

1248
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,480
bad guys think that they're really

1249
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,880
sneaky of course uh security researchers

1250
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,920
and security companies think that

1251
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,680
they're really sneaky too so they like

1252
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,680
to scan the internet and

1253
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,760
and and do it from one place and

1254
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,920
advertise who they are and then also do

1255
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,440
it from somewhere else but not tell you

1256
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,520
where that it's them and it all looks

1257
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,720
the same when you're actually looking at

1258
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,000
the dated scale so they're not really as

1259
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,920
sneaky as they think they are um and

1260
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,800
then

1261
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,720
just a funny thing that we noticed uh

1262
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,800
last year was um

1263
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,920
somebody

1264
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,440
was

1265
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,200
blasting

1266
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,200
printers in across the world with

1267
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,280
um

1268
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,119
anti-capitalist messaging specifically

1269
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,760
to try to print documents out of receipt

1270
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,800
printers

1271
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,760
in restaurants and in hotels and things

1272
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,520
like that that literally had like

1273
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,119
anti-capitalist messaging of like

1274
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,240
quit your job form a union you're worth

1275
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,440
more than this

1276
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
and it was really interesting for us so

1277
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,280
we actually reported it and a couple of

1278
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,200
people actually wrote about it but i

1279
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,480
remember when we saw this we were

1280
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,160
thinking like is this

1281
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,720
is this really happening right now and

1282
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,040
we got on reddit and on twitter and

1283
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
there were like a lot of people that

1284
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,599
were at work like yo can someone help me

1285
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,280
fix my printer it just keeps printing

1286
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,520
these things out and uh like just

1287
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,280
uploading tweeting pictures of it which

1288
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,839
we thought was really interesting um but

1289
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,000
it was we saw you know five or six

1290
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,079
different versions of the message and

1291
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,960
they all had some different kind of like

1292
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,000
you know you're uh you're a wage slave

1293
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,400
you know you need go home uh form a

1294
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,160
union right now these are your workers

1295
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,839
rights like things like that it was

1296
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,680
really really interesting so it was just

1297
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,800
a fun thing that we saw at the end of

1298
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,920
the year last year um so anyways uh like

1299
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,280
kind of to to wrap all this stuff up um

1300
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,319
more basically uh

1301
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,160
the thing that we can actually do about

1302
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,880
this

1303
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,920
is um kind of a whack-a-mole style

1304
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,520
system where

1305
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,440
again there's nothing we can do about

1306
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,920
the exploits really they're gonna happen

1307
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,640
and

1308
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,920
that's just kind of how it is um but

1309
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,160
the whack-a-mole method of blocking

1310
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,839
things prior to them getting to you

1311
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,839
actually shows a surprising amount of

1312
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,480
promise um so i'm going to just talk to

1313
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,680
you guys really quickly about an

1314
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,359
experiment that we run at gray noise

1315
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,720
pretty often

1316
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,359
so our hypothesis is basically

1317
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,240
if you block pretty much everyone who's

1318
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,000
scanning and crawling the internet uh

1319
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,359
whether they're good guys or bad guys

1320
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,599
like whatever if you just block it all

1321
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,640
um with really really short like short

1322
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,480
narrow windows all the time um it will

1323
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,960
take longer for a device to get

1324
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,960
compromised that's it

1325
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,599
right it will make the problem suck less

1326
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,599
so to kind of test this we stand up two

1327
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,160
identical hosts on the internet that are

1328
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,040
both

1329
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,760
really really vulnerable okay and it's

1330
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,280
actual software they're really running

1331
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,839
all this stuff and we just basically say

1332
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,079
all right extremely vulnerable host

1333
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,559
right here uh good luck you're naked and

1334
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,240
that's the end of that and then another

1335
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,680
host right here where it's actually

1336
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
blocking all of the ip addresses that

1337
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,720
are scanning and crawling the internet

1338
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,119
exploiting the internet etc and we

1339
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,960
measure the time that it takes for them

1340
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,559
to get compromised and then we do it

1341
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,160
again and then we do it again then we do

1342
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,359
it again and what we found is that uh

1343
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,359
with at least like easily guessable

1344
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,400
credentials it takes 20 minutes for a

1345
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,559
host that's on the internet to get

1346
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,680
compromised on average um

1347
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,920
now we used easily guessable credentials

1348
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,040
because it's common on the internet and

1349
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,079
it's also kind of the same thing as when

1350
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,480
a really bad vulnerability has just come

1351
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,079
out at least from the defender's

1352
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,400
perspective right um

1353
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,000
when we blocked the traffic it took the

1354
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,240
same very very very very vulnerable host

1355
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,960
four days to get compromised that's a

1356
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,319
lot of time right and now we still have

1357
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,760
a lot more work to do on this and we

1358
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,680
still have to you know figure out with

1359
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,400
more confidence that um certain parts of

1360
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,720
this are viable but this is actually

1361
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,480
like really really promising right so

1362
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,520
this is something that we're really

1363
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,440
really excited about so what we found is

1364
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,599
that like the dumbest method you could

1365
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,280
possibly think of of solving this

1366
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,160
problem actually is pretty effective um

1367
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,559
little tiny fast ip block lists that are

1368
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,960
updating all the time that are big right

1369
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,040
big block lists

1370
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,400
they work a lot better than we thought

1371
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,079
they were going to work so it's really

1372
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,240
exciting so anyways to stay in front of

1373
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,400
the next log for j

1374
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,760
there's really not a lot we can do about

1375
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,599
the vulnerabilities themselves but we

1376
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,359
can actually

1377
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,760
help this problem by centralizing

1378
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,880
information and uh as best we can or at

1379
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,040
least giving people a window into

1380
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,480
everything that's going on with

1381
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,880
opportunistic exploitation um and

1382
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,200
providing like ready to use block lists

1383
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,520
that are updating all the time

1384
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,480
right

1385
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,680
so um that's what we built and um and

1386
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,240
that's what we're releasing uh right now

1387
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,040
uh at this exact moment uh for for free

1388
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,359
for everybody um and so basically this

1389
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,359
is a a free product that we're releasing

1390
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,200
called uh grey noise community trends

1391
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,280
and so what this is is this you can go

1392
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,240
to this right now if you're on your

1393
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,760
laptop you just go to gray noise and you

1394
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,000
can click on a tag and everything works

1395
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,720
and you go here and basically this one

1396
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,040
is for log4j but you go here you can see

1397
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,280
a time series of how much exploitation

1398
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,119
of a vulnerability is happening at scale

1399
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,200
on the internet right now um you can see

1400
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,720
a timeline etc and you can see over here

1401
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,280
on the right side we've got a button

1402
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,079
that says block at firewall right so you

1403
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,839
click that button and then it pops out

1404
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,599
this thing that has a block list url

1405
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,960
that's it's a custom block list

1406
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,920
basically right so you grab this url and

1407
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,680
that that url at the end of that is a

1408
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,680
uid right and you you basically punch

1409
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,760
that firewall list

1410
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,200
into that url into your palo alto into

1411
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,680
your cisco asa into your whatever so the

1412
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,680
next time this happens you're gonna be

1413
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,240
able to really quickly go from oh my god

1414
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,680
everything is bad

1415
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,920
everything's on fire and you grab this

1416
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,520
and then this is me just curling it it's

1417
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,119
just an ip list right of everyone who's

1418
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,440
exploiting that vulnerability etc and

1419
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,200
and so this is free this is available

1420
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,319
right now and our hope is that basically

1421
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,880
the next time things get bad um people

1422
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,319
are going to be able to really easily go

1423
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,400
from learning what they need to learn

1424
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,839
and blocking the host that they need to

1425
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,520
block we're not going to make you safe

1426
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,280
forever but

1427
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,040
we are going to make you safe for long

1428
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,240
enough that hopefully you can do

1429
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,760
something about it right you can you can

1430
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,839
actually do the you can apply the patch

1431
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,440
you can put the rules in your seat in

1432
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,680
your cdn or in your waff or however

1433
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,000
you're doing that um and so hopefully

1434
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,599
this is you know something that really

1435
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,200
provides some value back to the security

1436
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,480
community and we're really excited to

1437
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,839
announce that we've put a lot of work

1438
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,760
into kind of getting it together and so

1439
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,839
i'm really happy and excited about it so

1440
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,359
um anyways and in conclusion here um

1441
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,359
internet exploitation internet wide

1442
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,680
exploitation mass scanning the internet

1443
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,920
uh people trying to exploit as many

1444
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,119
different devices on the internet as

1445
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,280
humanly possible it is quantifiably

1446
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,480
getting worse

1447
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,040
i really hate to tell you that it is

1448
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,040
just getting worse um it's gonna

1449
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,960
continue to get worse and that's just

1450
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,680
how it's going to be um a really big

1451
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,680
network of sensors kind of like gray

1452
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,520
noise um

1453
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,040
is

1454
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,119
something that is actually effective at

1455
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,800
buying people a little bit of time to

1456
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,160
solve the problem

1457
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,960
and

1458
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,800
running a really big network of sensors

1459
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,559
is a huge pain in the ass there are so

1460
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,079
many problems but um i i wanted to cover

1461
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,920
as many of those as you can and if you

1462
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,440
do it you'll kind of understand some of

1463
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,040
those problems as well you probably want

1464
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,200
to use ours but that's fine um and

1465
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,800
instead of like

1466
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,040
just hoping that the vulnerability

1467
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,200
doesn't happen it will

1468
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,119
right so let's just get prepared for

1469
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,559
what we can do the next time this

1470
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,880
happens right so that things aren't as

1471
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,559
bad and

1472
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,240
and that's it so i just want to say

1473
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,759
thank you guys so much for having me

1474
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,570
