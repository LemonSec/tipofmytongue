name is villain Guevara inas I was

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,550
introduced I'm the owner and director of

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,359
the small Slovenian hacking company

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,920
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> virus ah and I'm a little bit</font>

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,130
tired why because I'm on a road since

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,329
friday since we have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Vulcan</font>

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">conan novice at then afterwards i flew</font>

11
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,280
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dubrovnik gay presentation there so i</font>

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,890
was back yesterday and today I'm here

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,100
and I'm really happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font>

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,699
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my second time in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virus team I</font>

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,100
remember my first time but only vaguely

16
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:59,460
because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like eight or maybe ten</font>

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,550
years because at that time we are still

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,099
in living in the same country so we made

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,740
an excursion to<font color="#CCCCCC"> water steam and only</font>

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,309
thing I can remember is<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinking windy</font>

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,890
you know Jews I guess it's still here

22
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,240
right it still exists I'm still existing

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,820
so okay as I said I'm medical hacker I

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,860
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like enjoying enjoyed the flying</font>

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,720
the drones lately why because you can

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,150
sniff a lot of Wi-Fi traffic if you're

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">flying the drones and really from far</font>

28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,119
far away and just for a short notice

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the location that i gave I and</font>

30
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,630
my friends we my colleagues we gave

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,060
presentations so you can see we have

32
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,259
been all around the world so i will put

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,600
also working on my on this on this map

34
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:49,020
okay so are we going to be playing a

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,759
little bit with a verified packet so if

36
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,509
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see your Wi-Fi packets don't</font>

37
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,759
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> off your Wi-Fi because in slovenia</font>

38
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have been really bad reputation so if</font>

39
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,740
everybody sees me you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

40
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,259
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> he does you know it's like turn</font>

41
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,419
off Wi-Fi why because it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

42
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,878
of fun and you don't have to touch any

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,940
people you just touch them their Wi-Fi

44
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,829
packets so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see but even</font>

45
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,560
if you do it I already

46
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,540
a scan some Wi-Fi packets that your

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,880
device have been saying out so we still

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,730
will have some fun but we will do it

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,840
otherwise we can do it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> real time so</font>

50
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:32,100
what's the agenda for<font color="#CCCCCC"> today um this is</font>

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,320
it so if somebody knows how to let's say

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,230
we seek oh it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like</font>

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,180
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this so we will be</font>

54
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,989
inserting something selecting something

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,970
and creating abuse so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

56
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:48,330
visualization of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data so important</font>

57
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,450
because our eyes are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good at</font>

58
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,970
spotting the patterns and it's our eyes

59
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:58,049
and our mind it so it's made so that

60
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,750
it's really easy to strange to notice

61
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:06,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">really strange patterns and get some</font>

62
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,560
crazy ideas so where is the solution and

63
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,370
what is the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> today I will be</font>

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,950
showing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big data in</font>

65
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,680
really simple way on two different cases

66
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,350
one is the Wi-Fi packets why because if

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,690
you're scanning blood Wi-Fi you can get

68
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,590
a large amount of data and if you need

69
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:28,800
to see what's actually there the this

70
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:33,769
the big data analyzing is really helping

71
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:38,310
and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way in some other cases</font>

72
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:40,560
which are not let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Morris ethical</font>

73
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,290
hacking but maybe in incidence response

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,800
if you need to analyze really quickly

75
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,290
analyze and dig dig deeper into some

76
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,320
kind of apache logs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to be</font>

77
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,269
showing this into two ways how to be

78
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,769
really quick and really effective and

79
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:01,260
really getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the problems first if</font>

80
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,110
we play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Wi-Fi packet so this is a</font>

81
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,390
kind of Wi-Fi spectrum so let me ask you

82
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">a question Wendy when was the last time</font>

83
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:13,820
you have seen your Wi-Fi packet has

84
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,858
anybody seen his wife I packet lately

85
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:22,000
sorry he

86
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:23,740
two minutes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen okay but who's</font>

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,900
scanning the Wi-Fi networks who's doing

88
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,990
this hacking stuff one hand and nobody

89
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:35,770
else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might see you might hear</font>

90
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measuring gates it's no point of</font>

91
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,479
view so you're saying so if you're

92
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,960
scanning normally you see like this

93
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,750
right if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use from hacking tools your</font>

94
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,409
stucked in the you stuck at the terminal

95
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,509
window and if you're using aircrack of

96
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:55,240
programs from<font color="#E5E5E5"> eric family you normally</font>

97
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:59,169
stuck at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know so but with this</font>

98
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,039
if you have really let's say busy Wi-Fi

99
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:05,710
networks with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> yuri screen even gets</font>

100
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,870
too small to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that so but wouldn't be</font>

101
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:12,090
nice to have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this so you</font>

102
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:15,939
transfer<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this to this is it better</font>

103
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:19,409
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think which one would you</font>

104
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:25,389
prefer this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose for this one Oh</font>

105
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:27,520
real hackers with this one nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

106
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:30,520
finish my talk then have a nice time

107
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,039
have a nice day no really but why the

108
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,719
big data because if you're scanning the

109
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,719
packets and if you're saving them to

110
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:40,150
somewhere you know in real quick time

111
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:43,479
you get a lot of lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no so</font>

112
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why it's big data and its really</font>

113
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,500
matters it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the size you know</font>

114
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,259
because normally says well size matters

115
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,120
well it matters in some cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's</font>

116
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:54,939
even more important with big big big

117
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,960
data house to use it so i will show you

118
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:02,129
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it really can be done so in reality</font>

119
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,680
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this normally there is some</font>

120
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:08,770
some some tool if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,069
google from<font color="#E5E5E5"> vivek my children he had</font>

122
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:15,219
something but he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> using sequel database</font>

123
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:18,129
and some kind of tool but it's not that

124
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:22,659
sexy and if you want to play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

125
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:24,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">big data definitely since</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

126
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:28,449
programmer anymore I've been developing

127
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">for seven years before hacking my</font>

128
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,289
hacking life we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font>

129
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,340
doubt any programming so without writing

130
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:41,628
any and line of code so what do you

131
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:44,090
think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that possible yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i</font>

132
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:47,120
will show<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but first where do we start</font>

133
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:51,258
what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need if we if we want to get</font>

134
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,879
some nice diagrams first of all first of

135
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,129
all of course need hardware and a

136
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,800
software it's a perfect combination but

137
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,979
since that we are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

138
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,259
conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

139
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:05,300
so let's start with the hardware you

140
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:09,229
know definitely who owns alpha card

141
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:12,199
Wi-Fi one two three<font color="#CCCCCC"> four five six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven</font>

142
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:14,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great why it's alpha card well</font>

143
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,780
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has a pretty let's say</font>

144
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,710
powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> think but you can also use some</font>

145
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:23,739
other other cards but you have to take

146
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,969
care that's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right chipset</font>

147
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,180
definitely you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a USB cable if</font>

148
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:32,449
you're let's say sniffing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am you</font>

149
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,639
especially need a long Wi-Fi cable Oh a

150
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,259
USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable and you need a power and you</font>

151
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,870
need a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen why because if you</font>

152
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:41,270
want to visualize all these data if you

153
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,870
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of small screen you won't</font>

154
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,969
see almost everything then on the other

155
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,250
side you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a software so it doesn't</font>

156
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your linux windows mac fan</font>

157
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,370
whatever but if you're going to some

158
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,550
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of exotic let's say platforms like</font>

159
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,029
raspberry pi you might run into some

160
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,029
kind of challenges especially with one

161
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,620
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the software and sometimes you</font>

162
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:08,960
need to compile a little bit by yourself

163
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,099
but you don't have to change any of the

164
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,590
code so so we have a hardware we have a

165
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,949
software and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

166
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,960
environment that actually gets into

167
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,150
nature will all these data scanned into

168
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the environment and you get the data so</font>

169
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,400
another two things so let's start with

170
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,370
the building blocks the first one is

171
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually alex tech who has played with</font>

172
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">the elastic search and cabana and some</font>

173
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,990
other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it are</font>

174
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,208
three parts there are three parts of the

175
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">alex tak i won't go into details</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i won't</font>

176
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,229
go into installing configuring but the

177
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,170
elastic search is

178
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:52,190
it's actually search index<font color="#E5E5E5"> logstash and</font>

179
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:54,079
lately call lately this building block

180
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,060
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called beats before it was log</font>

181
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,430
stash forwarder it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font>

182
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,040
parsing block it can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

183
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,949
different manipulation of the locks and

184
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,050
at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> its let's say most important</font>

185
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,520
thing for the visualization of this data

186
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,349
that's actually lying somewhere there

187
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:16,360
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cabana so for those that haven't</font>

188
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:22,100
been playing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it these are just some</font>

189
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,930
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine so you can have such nice</font>

190
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,730
graph as this so you can visualize

191
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,459
whatever you want you can visualize the

192
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">databases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can visualize the Apache</font>

193
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:34,340
traffic you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can visualize the syslog</font>

194
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:36,350
it's really simple because it has log

195
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:41,060
stash and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> components has they have</font>

196
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:44,360
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> few quite few numbers of plugins</font>

197
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:48,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if you really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to analyze for</font>

198
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,110
example rse somebody is still on RC yeah

199
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,630
one so you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug it in and you know</font>

200
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get everything that's what is</font>

201
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:59,480
going on on RC so as I said first you

202
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,610
have somewhere lockstitch server you

203
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,650
have a indexing engine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have the</font>

204
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,880
web interface and the end and you have

205
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:10,670
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer so if you want to set up</font>

206
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,760
an elk stack it's really easy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

207
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:16,969
several good tutorials<font color="#CCCCCC"> all I'm won't go</font>

208
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,160
into the details but once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage to</font>

209
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,940
get it up and running the next time

210
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,810
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up in like half</font>

211
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:30,250
an hour to one hour you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have the</font>

212
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:33,949
working and running<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole stack of</font>

213
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:37,610
course there is no not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the good</font>

214
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:40,220
stuff with alch are related but also

215
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,650
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issues first there is no</font>

216
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,070
security so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're playing with the</font>

217
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:49,670
elastic search and cabana and you're

218
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:52,430
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> setting it up without any without</font>

219
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:56,180
anything they're quite everybody can

220
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,370
connect to it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might get into you</font>

221
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,589
might run into some kind of

222
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,029
shoes and if you're looking if you want

223
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:04,820
to go to see what's actually out there

224
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:08,420
just go to Sholan search elastic search

225
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:12,800
and you will find several good resources

226
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:15,260
of personal information when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was doing</font>

227
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">the presentation last year in Austria I</font>

228
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:22,010
just went through the went through the

229
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,610
show done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found some let's say</font>

230
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting medical data some</font>

231
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:32,210
well-known people there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are problems</font>

232
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,130
with alerts well Alex<font color="#CCCCCC"> tack is also now</font>

233
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,110
changing a little bit so you have some

234
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:39,380
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of features but for some of them</font>

235
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:41,000
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay so there are still under</font>

236
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,480
constant development now<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,360
preparing the version 5 and some of the

238
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,670
functionalities are lacking so we're

239
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,990
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting for for those to appear</font>

240
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:56,300
may be some some interesting stuff is

241
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,360
that now they also have kind of graphs

242
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,209
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the graphs</font>

243
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:05,779
it's also very good very good

244
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:09,470
possibility to do it with visually<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

245
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:13,610
so we now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> our elk set let's say set</font>

246
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,920
it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see we want to</font>

247
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:21,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">see the packets we need to get data</font>

248
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,719
inside of this elasticsearch stack so

249
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,480
for those who doesn't know aircrack-ng

250
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,790
it's actually software for sniffing the

251
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,000
Wi-Fi packets and playing and education

252
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,520
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

253
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,279
plenty of the tools but when we have

254
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,250
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with our crack we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notice</font>

255
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is there were some problems</font>

256
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,950
first of all um it doesn't speak Jason

257
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,310
if you have elastic search or some kind

258
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:52,010
of other data you know lately<font color="#E5E5E5"> the JSON</font>

259
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,170
is kind of standard for the for the for

260
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:57,529
the data input so it doesn't speak we

261
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,599
try different ways how to do it we tried

262
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:04,520
with parsing the output we try to

263
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:08,360
parsing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Serie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CSV files that</font>

264
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,930
aircrack-ng produces but we fail that

265
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,350
every time so now you're going to say

266
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,319
well

267
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,360
you said no programming he said how we

268
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">should do it without programming cual</font>

269
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,470
with visualization data you don't need

270
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,810
programming but for input we need to

271
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:27,650
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code so we try to change the</font>

272
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:32,109
code for aircrack-ng<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

273
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:34,370
managed to to let's say brush up our

274
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,410
programming skills and we change the

275
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,290
source code so it actually aircrack-ng

276
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,689
also spits now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON out we</font>

277
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,880
contributed to the main branch but I

278
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:47,510
check the latest version and they still

279
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,330
haven't included but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

280
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,620
show you the URL where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find</font>

281
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,660
dispatch if somebody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play it</font>

282
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just paged aircrack-ng and it will</font>

283
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:00,260
spill spill out them without the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON</font>

284
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:04,250
the JSON document where we are when we

285
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:07,880
were coding we also notified that there

286
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:10,490
are some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of colors you don't see it</font>

287
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,760
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation is going to be</font>

288
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,470
posted to afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can check it</font>

289
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,990
we ran into some kind of other issues

290
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,240
because there was some strange barrier

291
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:24,260
in the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> code it said that the only</font>

292
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,170
scans like 30 probes per device so we

293
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,390
changed that so I we can now grab more

294
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:32,630
than hundred probes for one device<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

295
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:35,449
your phones are sending out and actually

296
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,939
the major part was the dump right Jason

297
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:42,470
method<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually dumping the JSON</font>

298
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:44,330
to the file or to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> semester so we</font>

299
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,910
ended up after coding something like

300
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,070
this so we have MAC addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

301
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:53,300
have first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

302
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:56,420
this is the output of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the error dumper</font>

303
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:01,310
program but let's see how this one works

304
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:06,949
in in in a real time so as I said you

305
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:08,359
know first first when you start you're

306
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be ending something like this</font>

307
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,830
you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

308
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:18,530
year in may or june<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you'll get</font>

309
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:22,280
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta set up the elastic search you</font>

310
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:26,170
have all the data everything is working

311
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:30,100
you see that data is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time na</font>

312
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:33,099
you have all parameters and everything

313
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:38,980
and now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you have the data</font>

314
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:41,800
but now what so we didn't have clue that

315
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,019
time what can we do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we started a</font>

316
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit building and visualizing and</font>

317
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:51,880
the end result of this one it was like

318
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:54,790
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this so this is actually</font>

319
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,000
the visualization of Wi-Fi traffic

320
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,730
around dust so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> build different kind</font>

321
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,250
of modules since it is really easy to

322
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:07,720
build it so you can get really quick

323
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:12,130
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this kind of Wi-Fi packets</font>

324
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:15,360
that are running<font color="#E5E5E5"> around us now and then</font>

325
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:18,189
we as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said we made some really quick</font>

326
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,610
and effective demo so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

327
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:23,139
what's actually are around us so these

328
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,079
are divided<font color="#CCCCCC"> files with our strongest</font>

329
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:28,300
strongest signals we have also kind

330
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:36,189
information who is using what<font color="#E5E5E5"> caffeine</font>

331
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:40,660
encryption and my my my alpha cards have

332
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:43,390
seen around 441 different mobile devices

333
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,709
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> thus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so and this means that they</font>

334
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">have been just hoping around the</font>

335
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:51,189
channels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and seeing what's what's in</font>

336
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:55,510
there so if i count<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I cannot count</font>

337
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:58,240
until four hundred people right here no

338
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,180
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i have seen four hundred at least</font>

339
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">400 different devices around me so</font>

340
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:06,040
probably this means<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if somebody is</font>

341
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:10,059
walking nearby here and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a really</font>

342
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,760
strong strong phone that's sending out

343
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:15,939
the beacons and asking who is actually

344
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the / networks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see this so i</font>

345
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:23,500
can see also that f<font color="#E5E5E5"> sec is used in</font>

346
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,599
ubiquiti networks access points and

347
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,660
there are some kind of samsung probably

348
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a access point made from the</font>

349
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:35,679
phone and let's see who is winning so

350
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:37,540
samsung kies winning apple is running

351
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,820
the second then the samsung<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you</font>

352
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,539
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together the samsung</font>

353
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:45,840
still leader with client vendor so your

354
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:48,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">phones you divide your tablets your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PC's</font>

355
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,809
and everything it's still there but this

356
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this oh it's not so let's say not so</font>

357
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:57,750
sexy this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of data but we can go</font>

358
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">through it so you see this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

359
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:05,220
part where it's actually starts why

360
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:07,590
because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I let me try to put this</font>

361
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:14,899
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and see if</font>

362
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:19,039
this one will work let me see why

363
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:28,529
because here you see who knows what

364
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:31,169
Wi-Fi probes are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes Wi-Fi probes</font>

365
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:35,879
are Wi-Fi probes your device are sending

366
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:38,490
out probes from your list of why

367
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:40,379
connected Wi-Fi devices that you have

368
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,200
been connected lately or I don't know

369
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:45,629
maybe some I once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a guy who had</font>

370
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,690
like over 200 probes so actually he

371
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:55,199
never deleted his Wi-Fi connections but

372
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:56,639
here you see that I found it some of the

373
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,769
phones you know they're sending out

374
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:01,229
really good good information you know

375
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:02,940
from this one what can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

376
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,519
if you're a hacker from this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

377
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,879
information can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see there's can you</font>

378
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:12,179
get some interesting data out of it yes

379
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:16,289
what can you do you know something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

380
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:22,080
this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually where</font>

381
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:26,039
they've been right but locations yeah so

382
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,949
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think he's sharing a lot or he's</font>

383
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:34,110
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just staying home or trying a</font>

384
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:36,779
lot traveling a lot so so I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

385
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,570
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> this person you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know he has</font>

386
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:42,360
been also at the one security event in

387
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:45,360
Slovenia so probably because Thurman a

393
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:03,530
we can see a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of it you know</font>

394
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:07,040
probably this one this one is coming

395
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:09,200
probably from Croatia free via<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chaka</font>

bit better so I'm tuna which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kingdom if</font>

405
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:41,690
you if you recognize your phone you're

406
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:44,899
recognized education go back one that's

407

don't know what's your device or Mars is

409
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,190
wise but I know where you have been and

410
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,590
if you put this this Wi-Fi addresses

411
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:57,080
there are some like wiggle if you put

412
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:59,120
the Wi-Fi<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit name you can get actually</font>

413
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,149
the real addresses of the people so real

414
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,309
coordinates were actually this Wi-Fi is

415
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:10,190
Wi-Fi is a success but let's move on so

416
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,750
you see these are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next Fink is when</font>

417
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,490
we started you know to take it a little

418
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,309
bit in too deep these are the most

419
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:20,510
favorites it's so at least 30 devices a

420
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:26,139
scout for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> f sec but the marcin more</font>

421
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:26,140
interesting is like who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> kuzma dama</font>

422
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,600
any anybody because you see with this

423
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,059
one you can say you can group people

424
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,669
together so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that somebody is</font>

425
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:41,600
working for let's see if we try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> doma</font>

426
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:43,910
consider this one also goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so at</font>

427
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,350
least six people in ofc co-organizers

428
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:50,360
but maybe if we find see I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

429
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,010
where this one is but you see who's

430
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,809
hanging together so you can actually be

431
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,760
grouped people together so I don't know

432
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,530
who is belonging but I know if I click

433
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,780
it here i know i will get the all

434
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:03,280
devices so I know he's using the LG he's

435
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,500
using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple actually group people</font>

436
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,440
to see who is hanging together with hit

437
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,320
with whom so it's really nice to have

438
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you have you</font>

439
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,480
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have another just what's going on</font>

440
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,970
you see from this one the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> omkar</font>

441
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other one card rulinea free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

444
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,220
somewhere free I know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

445
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:33,730
are connected to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> f sec but since is</font>

446
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:36,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're probably your most coming from</font>

447
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,750
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Croatia so you're not connecting to</font>

448
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,220
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> F sack because I wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect</font>

the refs<font color="#E5E5E5"> acheter on a security</font>

450
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:46,030
conference so using so using the your

451
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,280
mobile operator so that's why it's only

452
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,920
19 people on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> F sex so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can use it</font>

453
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,110
also as kind of intrusion detection if

454
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,030
you know that you can have maximum of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

455
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,649
people if somebody jumps to the 20

456
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,990
people you know that your Wi-Fi password

457
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:02,020
has been shared summer so you can see

458
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,850
who's and who is the most active and if

459
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,629
it's open network you can get there

460
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:09,340
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the Wi-Fi IP addresses</font>

461
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:12,300
let's move to the to the last one since

462
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,980
my time well I still have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so</font>

463
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,899
this one what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think this one</font>

464
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,750
belongs because we have been speaking

465
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,150
about the visualization of the data do

466
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:33,370
you have any clue what's this what is

467
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:35,140
this port court yeah I've always a pie

468
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:41,169
chart yeah but what do you think this

469
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:43,750
day Tyler are up there yes well let me

470
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:48,160
let me let me explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here so if you</font>

471
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">go here these this is the SSID basis</font>

472
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:55,510
idea of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> f sec so we know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> f</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sac</font>

473
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,690
is the name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ss-led here in this layer</font>

474
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:01,870
we have the mac address of the earth sec

475
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:04,900
so in this layer we have all connected

476
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:09,459
clients to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the f sec Wi-Fi networks and</font>

477
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:11,290
here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end we have we have the mac</font>

478
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,900
address of the phone so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

479
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:16,030
it's a sony mac address of the phone

480
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,930
connected to the f sec there's Wi-Fi

481
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,110
address

482
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,390
and we can do this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> rogos is somewhere</font>

483
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,770
here around it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see also three</font>

484
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,810
clients they are connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also</font>

485
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">court city would it probably somewhere</font>

486
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,980
here around also connected and these are

487
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,470
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clients or I see okay they have</font>

488
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,480
what kind of devices they have samsung

489
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:38,380
they have samsung they have fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> height</font>

490
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,020
probably samsung also apple so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can do</font>

491
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,410
some nifty attacks if I know what kind

492
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,050
of devices they're using so it's really

493
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:48,430
visualizing and especially because

494
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:50,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">elasticsearch can offer like something</font>

495
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:55,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this so if you click just if you</font>

496
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:59,260
just choose the<font color="#E5E5E5"> f sec let's say so we</font>

497
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:02,260
will have only we will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the xik</font>

498
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,330
so at the moment we're only looking the

499
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,250
package directly actually connected to

500
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,470
the f sec what kind of the probes they

501
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,360
have been sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what kind of mac</font>

502
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,220
addresses so you can do filtering

503
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:18,280
without any programming without anything

504
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:20,440
without anything else so how hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

505
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,480
build this kind of the data well it's

506
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hard if we tried just to go</font>

507
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,450
with this one that's actually more let's

508
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:32,050
say more complicated it just this you

509
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:34,840
know just for different data that you

510
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:39,840
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to select and as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said without any</font>

511
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:42,970
without any programming the other thing

512
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,720
since 30 minutes is really really short

513
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,490
time to show it all the other thing gets

514
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,340
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it same with the apache logs</font>

515
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:54,660
you know it's pretty simple

516
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:57,939
configuration if you want to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

517
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,400
it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done offline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heavy logs</font>

518
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">whose grapping who's still grabbing the</font>

519
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,980
logs who's using the grep for<font color="#E5E5E5"> greater</font>

520
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:08,139
locks oh I'm not doing any correctly

521
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,150
more you just I just configured my

522
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,070
system for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> apache logs with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Alex tak</font>

523
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:15,820
it just drop the logs into some kind of

524
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:18,820
directory and it takes the logs analyzes

525
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:22,179
and at the end I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

526
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,280
like this this year I was catching some

527
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,550
bad guy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually hacking some</font>

528
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:30,509
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with help of this and with</font>

529
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:35,539
let's say they provided me

530
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:38,519
like 25<font color="#CCCCCC"> gigaba gigabytes of log files</font>

531
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:40,589
you know it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it was really</font>

532
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,769
easy and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some some</font>

533
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:45,928
dashboards<font color="#CCCCCC"> build like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a day if</font>

534
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:48,299
you know what you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing so it you</font>

535
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:52,070
can just go and dive into the into the

536
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:55,379
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that he has been</font>

537
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:57,448
coming from this this from this agents

538
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:59,809
from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> system and you can filter and</font>

539
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:04,049
dick into and you can get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

540
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:06,449
really good results if you want to do it

541
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:09,299
you can do it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> also on a live system</font>

542
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:12,479
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> beats package so you can just ship</font>

543
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:14,940
your old locks and you can you can

544
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:16,889
analyze it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

545
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,499
old locks just<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamp</font>

546
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:21,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">because otherwise you will get the fresh</font>

547
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:23,969
events you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to change little bit so</font>

548
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:26,639
it actually takes the time stamp from

549
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:30,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">the old locks you can have all the older</font>

550
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:33,089
history well are there any problems

551
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:36,089
because from until now everything was

552
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:39,119
nice and good and you know visual

553
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:42,539
visualized well of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course they are since</font>

554
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:45,599
the Alex tech elasticsearch<font color="#E5E5E5"> its runs</font>

555
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:47,249
java so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> java has been really</font>

556
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:53,099
hungry regarding the memory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

557
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:55,109
resources you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems but it's</font>

558
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:58,708
not always true because we managed to

559
00:27:55,109 --> 00:28:00,599
run it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a raspberry pi so you can run</font>

560
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:05,179
the whole character stack on a raspberry

561
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:07,829
pi so when we are you know let's say

562
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:11,249
working mission you don't want to carry

563
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:13,139
your notebook with you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just carry in</font>

564
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:14,639
one pocket you carry the battery pack in

565
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:17,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other pocket eukaryote Raspberry Pi</font>

566
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:20,039
in front you have two antennas you might

567
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:21,569
look a little bit strange well now in

568
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">the summer well in the winter it's not a</font>

569
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:26,190
problem but you can run the whole Alex

570
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:28,619
tack on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Raspberry Pi without any</font>

571
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:32,159
problems so this was the raspberry pi 2

572
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:34,109
but with three it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even better the only</font>

573
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,729
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the Wi-Fi on board it</font>

574
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:37,408
does it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> support any monitoring</font>

575
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:42,389
mode so you still have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some kind</font>

576
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:43,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of Wi-Fi Wi-Fi devices for those who</font>

577
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:47,399
wants to play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

578
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,040
well on our github there is a patch for

579
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,690
aircrack-ng if you want to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font>

580
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,050
you want to mess with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Wi-Fi</font>

581
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:59,370
packets um if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go with the</font>

582
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:01,740
apache logs<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still haven't managed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

583
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:06,080
put the files and the configuration on

584
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:10,290
it but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stop me and bug me</font>

585
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,960
so just to wrap up because my time my

586
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:15,810
time is almost up so also for hackers

587
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,120
big data is effect you know because

588
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:21,389
sometimes if you have really am a really

589
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,739
big amount of data it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font>

590
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:25,650
visualize and get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

591
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,590
interesting data out of this huge huge

592
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:31,260
huge number number of packets or log

593
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:34,199
files or whatever or documents can be

594
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,450
also done so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

595
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,000
something something similar to you to

596
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,400
analyze and to use it definitely the

597
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,660
elastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> searches</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it's a it's a good</font>

598
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:47,520
way but you need to be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at</font>

599
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,350
preparing the data so if you have a bad

600
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,710
data your outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be also</font>

601
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:55,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad one and first and the last thing</font>

602
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,920
don't give up you know because we had a

603
00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:02,310
data as I mentioned last June and we

604
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,350
didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> no it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like huh what now</font>

605
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:08,070
you know we have all this data what now

606
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,959
so you shouldn't give up after let's say

607
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:13,200
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the data and trying to</font>

608
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:17,460
visualize after 12 weeks you will see

609
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:21,810
the real potential of it so thank you

610
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:25,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">very much ah I will be still here around</font>

611
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:27,540
this day so if you have any questions I

612
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:32,250
will be more likely to answer even<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

613
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:34,530
Croatian language so then<font color="#CCCCCC"> degrees I'm so</font>

614
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,050
just just bug me because it's really

615
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:39,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice Fink and it can really help not</font>

616
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:41,909
only the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hackers but also some</font>

617
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,220
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from incident response or if you</font>

618
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some issues with the lock analyzes</font>

619
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,560
it's really good one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you very</font>

620
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">much</font>

621
00:30:53,270 --> 00:31:21,750
no questions only<font color="#CCCCCC"> one sure sure well I</font>

622
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:24,629
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say if you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the corporate</font>

623
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:28,130
networks then this is not so applicable

624
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:31,560
anymore but if you're going to because

625
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:34,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">some large manufacturing you know if</font>

626
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,360
they have because these all devices and

627
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,670
also some scalar connected devices they

628
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,740
are still using web but normally you

629
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:45,210
cannot just walk into it I know we have

630
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:48,570
been doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all last year 01 penetration</font>

631
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:50,940
test for one company we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> found</font>

632
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:53,639
with the drone so the Wi-Fi connected

633
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,860
there was easy to break and you can

634
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,380
actually get into the SCADA Network from

635
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,020
from there but in a corporate so if you

636
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,830
just parked the car outside on a parking

637
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:09,300
lot and try to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> their Wi-Fi well</font>

638
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:14,370
we didn't succeed let's say in last year

639
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:16,230
but we had we had success with success

640
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:19,949
with getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> their hashed passwords</font>

641
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:22,440
because they had not proper proper

642
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,570
configure their enterprise Wi-Fi

643
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:45,150
networks because they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

644
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:47,580
accepting all kind of serpents but it's

645
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,520
well it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not always true</font>

646
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:54,990
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you from my</font>

647
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:56,940
experience three weeks ago they had real

648
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:00,450
good configuration they had but they had

649
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,790
one guest Wi-Fi network you know open

650
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:05,490
they said it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only open today</font>

651
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:10,530
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guests only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the only goes</font>

652
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:12,960
through the internet but we noticed that

653
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">they having problems with their dns so</font>

654
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,240
with the right question we managed to

655
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:20,460
pursue we managed to get all internals

656
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,340
domains and IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> map their</font>

657
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,830
domain only with the usage of their dns

658
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:29,070
because it was misconfigured so normally

659
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:32,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">you cannot go there but you can get the</font>

660
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:35,909
credentials you can if because also

661
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,470
company employees they<font color="#E5E5E5"> known they are</font>

662
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">not always using just the corporate</font>

663
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,670
Wi-Fi networks but also so will be the

664
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">guest you can get the hashes if you try</font>

665
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:46,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like kind of responders you can</font>

666
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">get their guests their credentials or</font>

667
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,620
hashes so there are still kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> texts</font>

668
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:55,379
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as not as let's say trivial as</font>

669
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,719
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been let's say five years ago</font>

670
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">but still it's on it's an interesting</font>

671
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,370
interesting way so and you sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

672
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,160
would be surprised what you can learn

673
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:11,029
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> these all just scanning the Wi-Fi</font>

674
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:11,030
around or network so thanks
