1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:08,240
good day everyone my name is given

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,960
amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find up working for kaspersky</font>

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,440
lab for nine years already and i'm

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:19,550
heading<font color="#E5E5E5"> crushin part of a great team so</font>

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:23,240
my presentation for today is about like

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,970
our research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mostly about ethics so</font>

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:33,110
it like a first presentations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:35,690
it will be also food for thoughts so my

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,519
overview for today is a bit of

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:43,339
explanation who am i what we're doing

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,360
then we will go and see what happens

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:53,210
during several like<font color="#E5E5E5"> months and why</font>

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:55,460
attackers doing bad things mmm there are

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:01,090
Arsenal very interesting techniques that

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:05,659
we found recently and certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories</font>

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:12,860
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our leader Eugene Kaspersky</font>

17
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:15,560
and he founded our team if 2008 and we

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,979
are focusing not just on detecting my

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,369
way but on digging deeper so we are not

20
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:26,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">just to find it but connect all the dots</font>

21
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:28,310
grab her all explores the connected to

22
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,639
these things and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and so on so if</font>

23
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,500
them aware by<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking some factory it's</font>

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:39,470
our job we need to reverse engineer it

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:44,659
see what's happening and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on and what</font>

26
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:47,689
is like first like most interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

27
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:53,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">pima advanced</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> persistent attacks it he</font>

28
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:57,439
heard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> black energy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carbonic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

29
00:01:53,829 --> 00:02:00,919
first but before before stacks that

30
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,048
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see 2010 started so we were</font>

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,760
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years already working and we were</font>

32
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:09,360
prepared to reverse engineer this

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">these things actually what we use to</font>

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:19,470
protect is something like that and you

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:23,190
still remember your ATMs yeah still

36
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,350
running how many teams so do you think

37
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:34,609
still running in percent are still

38
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:37,350
running this operating system 9098 so

39
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is like and well this</font>

40
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:46,200
Microsoft's stopped issuing patches for

41
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:48,390
this system februari yeah so this actual

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,109
state of information security in the

43
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:56,250
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what was what we need to</font>

44
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:59,730
protect now is looking like that and do

45
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,209
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to update such things me</font>

46
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,619
know because for example to roll up

47
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,390
updates what you do you have a

48
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,820
production server you have a testing

49
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,799
server so you wrap up roll up updating

50
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:16,109
testing environment everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,270
then you move to production server to

52
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,810
overlap updates here you in to build

53
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:27,209
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one the same test everything</font>

54
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:30,600
roll up<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm yeah and these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

55
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:34,260
it built like 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago 10 years ago</font>

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:39,120
15 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it still works as it</font>

57
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,970
was designed and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that</font>

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,250
these things are connected to internet

59
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,630
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not designed to be connected</font>

60
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:51,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they are very often we do like a</font>

61
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:58,380
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail such kind of things and</font>

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:04,019
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one such incident we came to similar</font>

63
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:07,500
thing and understood that a developer is

64
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,590
that there is additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dsl modem in</font>

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,430
the network right they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it is a</font>

66
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">legacy petplan power plant why why do</font>

67
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,739
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to hear additionally dsl modem</font>

68
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,300
and it goes straight to the internet so

69
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:31,068
everybody said who this is some attacker

70
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:35,910
now how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say who it was engineer</font>

71
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:38,669
lazy engineers that don't want to go to

72
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:43,110

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:17,340
motivated main goal is to steal as much

82
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:21,690
money as it possible and on the top like

83
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:24,539
top-notch malware writers nation-state

84
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,630
states like with unlimited budget

85
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,820
unlimited time yeah you do you do

86
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:36,690
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the models mean like</font>

87
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:38,550
what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> next number of such</font>

88
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,539
attacks rose in these two segments

89
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">subsequence and after that we predicted</font>

90
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:48,690
it the line disappeared and eventually

91
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,349
all these techniques that were used by

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:55,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">nation-states all these technologies now</font>

93
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:58,169
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's now normal criminals now</font>

94
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">they using it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will show you a lot</font>

95
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:04,560
of examples of such things and as I

96
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned stacks that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like a first</font>

97
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,750
drop and so they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we started</font>

98
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:17,550
regulating such attacks so one by one

99
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:20,580
and not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> for so my profit of our</font>

100
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,159
company but we made it public so the

101
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,590
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience and to our people runs</font>

102
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:28,320
ago can benefit from it and know how to

103
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,320
do how to detect it and how to protect

104
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">it against such things</font>

105
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:38,159
and every time we detect something new

106
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,340
it's and we publish something new it's

107
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,960
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pink on a top of a mountain</font>

111
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,980
indifferent to other companies it is a

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,020
report on blockbuster malware or

113
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,190
Lazaro's<font color="#CCCCCC"> glute group that were</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">responsible for Sony hack and other</font>

115

hacks but rising sunny with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

116
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:19,289
interesting one and projects how one

117
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:27,090
this year very interesting my way I will

118
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:31,470
talk a bit more later on<font color="#CCCCCC"> reddit so for</font>

119
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,570
those who<font color="#CCCCCC"> already faced apts advanced</font>

120
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,640
persistent threat in their networks they

121
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:39,599
know it is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm right in your</font>

122
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:43,710
network hard to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of really hard</font>

123
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:48,270
hard to detect if you get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it they</font>

124
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:53,780
just came back another day and why they

125
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:57,359
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> here it is strategic position so why</font>

126
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:02,580
in some cases they're after your

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:07,490
business itself so they trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> steal</font>

128
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:10,109
your innovations blueprints trying to

local own network of your like who you

134
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:33,570
speak whoo you sell and so on and they

135
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:37,979
use this trust and they can like write

136
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:39,490
to these people yeah and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

137
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,440
writing them

138
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:48,040
and you can get access to networks if

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,040
you are like let's say IT company what

140
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,339
is the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> valuable asset most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable</font>

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital certificate your credential</font>

145
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:11,860
for different systems you're different

146
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:16,660
recommendation and in some cases we even

147
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:21,339
saw criminals were after physical plans

148
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:26,529
floor plans of offices why God knows why

149
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:30,100
but I'm afraid of it and if you are

150
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:33,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">research institute they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after some</font>

151
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,070
scientific stuff they are after your

152
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,890
secret studies especially if they are

153
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected to some military studies and</font>

154
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:45,250
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand like if you</font>

155
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:49,240
have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> government grants that means</font>

156
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:52,290
the study is very interesting and also

157
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,779
they use these institutes Institute's

158
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:59,980
and to research academy as approximate

159
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:03,040
proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exfiltrate data from different</font>

160
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,459
organizations small example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rating</font>

161
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,599
malware what they did they infected

162
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:14,520
several key organization in the country

163
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:21,430
let's call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it contradicts in involving</font>

164
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:24,970
president office and telecom provider

165
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:28,540
and also they can infect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that research</font>

166
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:32,279
institute so yes like<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

167
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:36,699
protecting governmental network is a

168
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:41,829
really look after who is where there are

169
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:44,829
traffic goes and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use this</font>

170
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:46,779
research institute as a proxy to proxy

171
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:49,060
fine it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our traffic from</font>

172
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,680
governmental network<font color="#CCCCCC"> to research</font>

173
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,680
institute and then out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> country</font>

174
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,250
and that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end also they're</font>

175
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:04,810
trying to understand business procedures

176
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:08,110
of some organizations and then blackmail

177
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:16,050
people and it happened several times

178
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:19,800
already so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like main motivation</font>

179
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:27,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">for apt attackers and what do they use</font>

180
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:31,510
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce you three nice guys so</font>

181
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:37,180
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like very fast explanation zero</font>

182
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:39,250
day one day only all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys so your</font>

183
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,939
network is well protected by they need

184
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:48,490
to get into somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in some cases</font>

185
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:51,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">people do I'll leave the door open get</font>

186
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,220
in but in most cases the door is closed

187
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:58,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">so to get the key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this closed door</font>

188
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:01,570
they need to use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of exploit so</font>

189
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">0d is exploit that there is no</font>

190
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:08,250
prevention against it yeah it means

191
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:12,209
nobody knows about it it costs $100,000

192
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:17,550
sometimes more and it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient</font>

193
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:22,569
all day he is a zero-day retired today

194
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:25,900
so but considering how slow everybody

195
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:28,870
updates it means is still effective if

196
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:32,199
you remember configure warm three months

197
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,120
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was released the patch stuff</font>

198
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,490
out it was released a patch for this

199
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerability that configure bomb used</font>

200
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:45,450
still 8 billion computers for vulnerable

201
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:48,670
08 million and one day one day is

202
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:52,000
interesting concept what barriers is

203
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:56,349
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse engineer patches that</font>

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,620
vendors issue and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh huh they just</font>

205
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,959
paged this chunk of code mm-hmm let's

206
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,589
check can we play you this check of co2

207
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,640
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now we have working exploit yes</font>

208
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:08,590
it's not

209
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,420
such effective is zero day but still

210
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:15,040
considering that everybody updates very

211
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:18,430
slow it will be it can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok after</font>

212
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">they get in they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to bypass internal</font>

213
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:24,670
security of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your castle</font>

214
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:27,660
yep so like in the castle you everybody

215
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:32,400
has the identity text yeah yeah and

216
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:37,870
guards checking them and this text in

217
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:41,230
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is certificate so what</font>

218
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:44,140
they do they issue fake certificates<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

219
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,090
it's easy to spot yeah like any normal

220
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,319
God God's will check<font color="#CCCCCC"> out now it's fake</font>

221
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,040
certificate you are not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

222
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:55,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything what they do also these steel</font>

223
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:59,020
certificates from vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuxnet you</font>

224
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:02,500
stolen a certificate like a lot of apt<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

225
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:06,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">text use stolen and certificates so it</font>

226
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the stall in quicker sonic</font>

227
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:15,069
mechanism like all the needed files and

228
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:17,890
that's it also they what they do is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

229
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:21,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in legal way kind of so they just</font>

230
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:25,990
register a firm<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sells vegetables</font>

231
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:29,589
and some other fruits and also this

232
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:32,500
company has a certificate for digital

233
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:36,880
for digital signing files why I don't

234
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:39,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it works and also what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw</font>

235
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:45,070
is a first for certificates so sometimes

236
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:50,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">people use weak encryption method</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or two</font>

237
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:55,300
small keys and bad guys can just for

238
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:58,420
justice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a certificate after they</font>

239
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,939
get in so they understand that

240
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they can need to move</font>

241
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:08,290
move on and the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases they just</font>

242
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:11,260
upload some first staging plant and this

243
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:15,839
implant searches for needed workstations

244
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:19,120
and then upload all other modules so

245
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,200
when you do incident response

246
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,600
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to get all the modules of</font>

247
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,600
given a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PD and what they can do they can</font>

248
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:33,040
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff like every time they</font>

249
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:37,089
do is file file system getting passwords

250
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:46,900
sound recording screen recording and

251
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:51,570
even smartphone infection and in the

252
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:53,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">most by advanced a text what we saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

253
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">demonstrated variety of other things</font>

254
00:15:53,830 --> 00:16:01,570
like register-based virtual file system

255
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:03,959
so when you do a forensic you found

256
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:08,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing interesting on the file system</font>

257
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:12,970
jailbreaking my bio lawyers they do fear

258
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:16,810
where infection of hard drives the only

259
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:19,630
way to disinfect such hard drive is it

260
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:27,880
take some something<font color="#E5E5E5"> very heavy and do</font>

261
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:31,420
like and<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSM such stations intercept and</font>

262
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:36,420
what we saw like this year is full

263
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:39,250
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromise like the network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

264
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:43,329
thousand computers is compromised but

265
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:48,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is in memory it means that</font>

266
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:53,200
the persistence modules is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> only on</font>

267
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:59,320
several key servers so every time you

268
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:01,750
switch on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC it's clean and several</font>

269
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,540
minutes after it's infected you

270
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:10,750
restarted it's clean several minutes

271
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:14,109
after it's infected and in other thing

272
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:17,920
that we also spotted during class two

273
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:21,059
years is a heavy usage of white listed

274
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:26,170
programs like legitimate problems

275
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:30,360
powershell scripts<font color="#CCCCCC"> vincy from profiles</font>

276
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,360
VNC<font color="#E5E5E5"> program and so on</font>

277
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:39,370
and now you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we think about like</font>

278
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:44,020
how they get in but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the last</font>

279
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:47,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is how to initially penetrate one</font>

280
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:51,700
systems as they need what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do good</font>

281
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:54,850
old spearfishing works very well don't

282
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:59,320
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everybody saw such a email</font>

283
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:01,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">such emails social networks and instant</font>

284
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:06,100
messaging the same way is spearfishing

285
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:09,820
watering holes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> once it is a infect a</font>

286
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:15,580
website that employees of a company

287
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:17,980
would sooner or later use for example

288
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,850
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> run some kind of scattered system</font>

289
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:24,490
and sooner or later you will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

290
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:29,490
schedule vendor website to download some

00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:25,050
safe is a commanded or operated by a

439
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:28,379
small computer on the top of this ATM

440
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:33,570
and have you ever seen how well

441
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:36,900
protected this computer is now you can

442
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:41,580
just in some banks SUV there is a master

443
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:45,210
keys for this door a service door in

444
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:48,270
some banks they change these keys but

445
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:58,080
anyway it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple key you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it</font>

446
00:29:48,270 --> 00:30:01,200
like NZ did and what we saw so on every

447
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,280
ATM there is special eggs if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll SBI</font>

448
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,080
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> its extension that Microsoft</font>

449
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:11,940
extension for working with financial

450
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:14,879
services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw a plastic virus like</font>

451
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,960
from 90s it was like it was like this

452
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:23,430
moment whom Wow something very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very old</font>

453
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:26,880
infection of this SBI service it

454
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:31,700
torrent is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly at the first</font>

455
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:36,360
point they switched off protection of

456
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:40,830
ATM but I will explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> some how they did</font>

457
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:47,959
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it guarantees that malicious dll</font>

458
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:52,620
will be in memory and they have special

459
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:55,650
magic cards with special check one and

460
00:30:52,620 --> 00:31:02,729
track to<font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and set the size</font>

461
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:06,060
card your ATM will show you this message

462
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:10,490
but the most interesting part of it was

463
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:14,250
that attackers didn't steal anything I

464
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:20,400
thinkers did what did not steal hmm

465
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:23,250
strange so it was a strange moment for

466
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:28,170
us and we started to dig deeper as

467
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:30,930
always and found this very worst

468
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:37,310
engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate and understood they have</font>

469
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:42,030
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> commands they can take money</font>

470
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:46,950
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> cassette it can gather all the</font>

471
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:55,740
information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on that card so we</font>

472
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:58,710
take one to two and then it can print it

473
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:02,370
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> because in each ATM there is</font>

474
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:05,160
embedded printer so very convenient

475
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:07,350
where you just criminal just came to ATM

476
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,620
print it out all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information</font>

477
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:14,120
gathered from this ATM it can sell

478
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:20,179
destroy switch the back boat and so on

479
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:24,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh no in our office we have several</font>

480
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:27,810
testing ATMs and here are my colleagues

481
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:31,040
they inserted a card it is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> famous</font>

482
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,040
carpet bank

483
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:37,659
so you see we reversed engineers it this

484
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,300
malware and we understood how it

485
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:45,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">operates so we just reproduced</font>

486
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:48,879
everything it asks for a one-time code

487
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:52,330
but because it is traditional virus this

488
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,520
why we know how this algorithm is inside

489
00:32:52,330 --> 00:33:01,199
of this virus<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to</font>

490
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:01,200
reproduce it simply so here you'll just

491
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:10,409
issue a comment to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> banknotes from</font>

492
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:21,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first cassette yep give banknotes</font>

493
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:27,760
enter and this it so it works perfectly

494
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:29,380
unfortunately this is a merger of like

495
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,980
techniques that were used by

496
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:35,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">nation-states to attack different</font>

497
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,600
companies now the same techniques is

498
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:42,810
used to attack for example finished

499
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:46,870
institutions by normal cyber criminals

500
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:54,760
but still we do a lot of cyber Spanish

501
00:33:46,870 --> 00:34:03,010
stories and for today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I prepared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 first</font>

502
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:25,030
one is the cosmic story what is it what

503
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:33,880
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now not to comment hmm close hmmmm</font>

504
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:39,520
kinda<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok it's satellite on a gear stable</font>

505
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:43,320
orbit so it doesn't move and to talk to

506
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,250
a satellite you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like this</font>

507
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:50,730
in a modern<font color="#CCCCCC"> world plus you need a dish</font>

508
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:53,850
yeah round and round and cool you get

509
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:58,040
your dish connected to this device dvb

510
00:34:53,850 --> 00:35:03,360
card and you can receive signals from

511
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:08,880
satellite and this is used by apt

512
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:11,490
attackers what for for hiding competent

513
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,120
control servers because if law

514
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:17,700
enforcement get content control server

515
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,670
it means operation is over and they can

516
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:24,839
understand how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> praise who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

517
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:28,350
victims who were maybe attackers and so

518
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:31,250
on so like comment control server is the

519
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:38,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">most vulnerable part of any operation</font>

520
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:44,640
what they did they used IP addresses of

521
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:53,040
different satellite users as a contact

522
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:58,170
at all server so how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works click</font>

523
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:04,080
click click malware in some organization

524
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:07,940
calls to IP address in some satellite

525
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:12,240
network in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP address range and</font>

526
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">sends pack it to this IP address it goes</font>

527
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:23,000
to satellite and goes down to this user

528
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:26,879
unfortunately this user doesn't has

529
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,800
don't have any open port for this packet

530
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:35,540
so it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> drops it because satellite</font>

531
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,340
connection is very slow and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

532
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:42,920
giving reply back that there is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> such</font>

533
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:48,600
open port the this packet just drops and

534
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:50,610
a taker receives this packet why he

535
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,569
receives this packet because there is no

536
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:56,430
encryption on the same matter because

537
00:36:53,570 --> 00:37:00,480
satellite link is very slow

538
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:04,350
there is no encryption so they receive

539
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,880
this message do all nursery staff and

540
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:10,770
reply back using traditional ethernet

541
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:14,940
why they can do it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this system</font>

542
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:17,130
like with original IP address don't

543
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:21,920
reply back it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just drops</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pocket and</font>

544
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:26,010
packet and a taker can simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> Forge</font>

545
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:30,630
needed pick it and reply back how to

546
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:34,530
find such let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> controller</font>

547
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:37,140
server quite impossible because like

548
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:42,740
it's several hundred square<font color="#E5E5E5"> kilometers</font>

549
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,740
and anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be this computer</font>

550
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:53,720
black<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy yeah I we it was already</font>

551
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:59,130
mentioned today<font color="#E5E5E5"> well backhander gym and</font>

552
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:03,810
what I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you is actually</font>

553
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:07,320
they got into a system of several oblast

554
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:12,840
and ergo it's like distribution

555
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:18,690
companies in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ukraine and they switched</font>

556
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:23,790
off several sub networks the worst part

557
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:28,740
of it is that 230,000 people were

558
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:35,279
affected and the two months later the

559
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:38,339
system is not fully operational and the

560
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,410
more and more apt c takers they

561
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:48,270
implement something in their platforms

562
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:54,240
and first signs of what they that black

563
00:38:48,270 --> 00:39:00,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">energy was trying to do such attack it</font>

564
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:05,910
is februari 2015 so like

565
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:09,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">11 months they tested solution let's</font>

566
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:14,009
call it solution and then they performed

567
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:17,328
an attack so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is a been treated</font>

568
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:20,310
a lot of systems a lot of companies and

569
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:23,400
they used for example they penetrated

570
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:25,740
small company then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> used VPN</font>

571
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:30,450
connection from this company to main

572
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:36,000
target too in fact to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in size of big</font>

573
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:41,098
<font color="#CCCCCC">network also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the all this story with bec</font>

574
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:45,240
ng it started 2007 and it was just

575
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:49,290
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> d does but and now it is fully</font>

576
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:54,629
operational apt<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sarah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> netting let's call</font>

577
00:39:49,290 --> 00:40:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">it platform with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thousands of plugins it</font>

578
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:07,369
can infect rotors different makers it

579
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:14,400
can work with a scatter of machines make

580
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:20,640
it can exit rate data from different

581
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:25,680
using different channels but still the

582
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:31,319
like people that word means to defend

583
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:34,980
yeah network of critical info session

584
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:38,849
networks they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> very few and that's</font>

585
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:42,540
why they were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like they were</font>

586
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:45,950
they had plenty of time to understand

587
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:50,220
how everything works and switched off

588
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:53,279
actually when people ask me like is it

589
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:56,279
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to switch you off any and</font>

590
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,190
electric electric grid in a world I say

591
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,579
no because in some key in most<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font>

592
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:05,339
they are unique and it's and each

593
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:08,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network electric power network is</font>

594
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:12,480
designed in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that is foolproof and</font>

595
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,400
means that it's like if you switch off

596
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:20,940
several relays

597
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:24,020
still uber national and one more

598
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting story projects are on</font>

599
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:32,190
actually it is not our name it is the

600
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:35,339
name of the developers name and what is

601
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:41,000
interesting we targeted very few

602
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:43,890
countries we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russia wonder Iran and</font>

603
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:49,650
our colleagues from Symantec saw also

604
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:55,109
Belgium Sweden and China so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

605
00:41:49,650 --> 00:42:01,039
not very big set of countries but it is

606
00:41:55,109 --> 00:42:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of victims is very very high and</font>

607
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:06,049
they just not just in fact several

608
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:11,430
computers they in fact the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole network</font>

609
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:16,259
and these guys they<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read our</font>

610
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:18,598
reports because like when you do

611
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:25,579
research you are searching for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

612
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:25,579
patterns and they do and they did unique

613
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:33,329
unique configuration unique files for

614
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:35,339
each victim which means indicators of

615
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:41,609
compromise in this case more or less

616
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:46,890
useless so what the key features they

617
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:53,480
have 50<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plugins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for doing different</font>

618
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:53,480
stuff they were interested in getting

619
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:00,420
keys configurations getting set to

620
00:42:57,569 --> 00:43:03,440
service to a special software was that

621
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:10,200
was used by government to encrypt

622
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:14,789
messages and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> always they use very</font>

623
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:20,368
strong encryption algorithms like 36 rc5

624
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:23,369
for Salazar 20 etc etc and they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

625
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:26,940
to exfiltrate data actually what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

626
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:29,670
did also<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accelerate data from</font>

627
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:34,710
networks and they facilitated gigabytes

628
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:37,619
of data they proxy fight through high

629
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:40,880
load servers like proxy server of an

630
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:43,140
organization webgate you know everybody

631
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,589
watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube in this organization</font>

632
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,328
coke we will use this server to

633
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:57,119
exfiltrate data because you wouldn't see

634
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:59,970
any spikes in this case and everything

635
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,140
is technical details showed us that

636
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:10,770
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys they learnt a lot from other</font>

637
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:13,799
extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced actors because they</font>

638
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:16,140
used features from DQ oh my where they

639
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,839
used features for flame and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the youth</font>

640
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,319
features from region so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

641
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:27,029
have ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to infect air-gapped net</font>

642
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:31,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">air-gapped networks they create special</font>

643
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:34,170
partition on USB drives that is not

644
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:40,890
visible<font color="#E5E5E5"> from windows but it is visible</font>

645
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:45,240
by former where they use registry-based

646
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:48,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">or visual file systems they use lua</font>

647
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:53,868
script like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of JavaScript language</font>

648
00:44:48,599 --> 00:45:07,790
to operate different to create plugins

649
00:44:53,869 --> 00:45:12,540
so yeah yep and for like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that</font>

650
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:15,890
as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see it's like race of weapons</font>

651
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:20,009
is always like getting faster and faster

652
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:22,049
then use new technologies by the way

653
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:27,599
it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> unknown how they got into</font>

654
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:30,000
this network no please right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and the</font>

655
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,869
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the line is disappearing not</font>

656
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,260
only in a way from that traditional

657
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:39,660
criminals learning from this highly

658
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:45,920
professional guys

659
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:51,029
but also once again lazzaro's team and

660
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:53,579
once again bangladesh bank heist when it

661
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:57,119
would do a lot of for your sins

662
00:45:53,579 --> 00:46:01,410
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're you're starting</font>

663
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:07,410
to find patterns you like patterns as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

664
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:11,848
mentioned it and i know there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

665
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:14,220
everybody likes the compiled code but

666
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:19,829
believe me it looks the same more or

667
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:22,589
less and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand side is a part</font>

668
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:25,589
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code that were used in Sony hack on</font>

669
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:32,700
the right hand side is a part of hope

670
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:37,558
that were found in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bangladesh Bank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

671
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:42,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference no difference what could</font>

672
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:46,109
it mean it could mean that these guys

673
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,808
the active from 2009 they attack

674
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:51,270
everything they take south korean

675
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:55,619
companies their tech<font color="#CCCCCC"> south korean</font>

00:46:51,270 --> 00:47:02,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sunny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and now they attack</font>

677
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:04,230
banks and there are used it also the

678
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,900
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem suffered several more banks</font>

679
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:10,220
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> vietnam and a couple different</font>

680
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:16,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries which good may i mean that</font>

681
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:22,189
this group also made like a billion of

682
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:31,200
dollars and it's like a new way of

683
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:34,260
getting funds for nation state actors so

684
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,660
it's a this line is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working only in</font>

685
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:40,069
one way

686
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:42,140
but in two thousand so the odium

687
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:48,710
ultimate the ultimate goal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

688
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:54,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys is power and money and by the way</font>

689
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:59,000
how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it getting as when they get him</font>

690
00:47:54,619 --> 00:48:03,440
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network of a bank to bypass</font>

691
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,260
security and to start issuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> fault</font>

692
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:11,780
length<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swift transactions they needed to</font>

page<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sews it pitched two bites</font>

694
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:19,160
of legitimate implication<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

695
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:24,828
enough to<font color="#CCCCCC"> steal more or less maybe 1</font>

696
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:29,118
billion another lesson there are a lot

697
00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:31,700
of ransomware and they're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wiper</font>

698
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:36,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">text right now it's in the crane it's in</font>

699
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:41,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Curia it's in Sony hack a lot of</font>

700
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:45,140
watering hole attacks and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

701
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:50,029
that apt attackers started to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

702
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:53,118
very aggressively I would say is giving

703
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:57,319
false flags into the implementing some

704
00:48:53,119 --> 00:49:00,859
false flags into their code what for

705
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:04,910
because everybody loves attribution it

706
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:06,980
is the main question for actually like

707
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:09,170
victim especially if it is a

708
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:14,869
governmental entity or something like

709
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:17,450
that and in some in most cases they are

710
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:19,910
what was it started to do as to how

711
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:22,250
attribution is done right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is the</font>

712
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:25,759
best tribution is when law enforcement

713
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:30,049
gets the server understand who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind</font>

714
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:36,200
the server and go to concrete to people

715
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:38,288
and provide them to to jail it's the

716
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,390
best attribution that could be made<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

717
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:44,799
but in digital world in most cases we

718
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:48,460
just rely on some infrastructure

719
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:53,170
overlaps come to control service I mean

720
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:56,680
in some forgotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> debug strings like in</font>

721
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:59,589
different languages also and they

722
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:02,529
started to just add some strings for

723
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:05,290
example in<font color="#CCCCCC"> romanian language some</font>

724
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,820
strings in<font color="#CCCCCC"> spanish show and you start</font>

725
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:09,940
this increment maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> spanish maybe not</font>

726
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:16,270
doin<font color="#E5E5E5"> samsung so attribution becomes</font>

727
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:18,490
harder and harder for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and it's more</font>

728
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:24,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and more cases of finalists malware and</font>

729
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:27,790
it means harder harder to do any

730
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:31,419
incident response because when you come

731
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:33,070
to a company and starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do instant</font>

732
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:37,089
response in<font color="#CCCCCC"> DB understands it there is</font>

733
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:43,150
no files created on file system<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

734
00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:49,779
problem and when you see work that all

735
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:52,390
the plugins also uploaded from attackers

736
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">come to control only in memory it's a</font>

737
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:57,970
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so you just get got like</font>

738
00:50:54,580 --> 00:51:06,339
small piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of puzzle without any</font>

739
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:09,580
additional pieces and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I already</font>

740
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:12,480
mentioned it but so apt techniques

741
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:15,900
actively adopted by cybercriminals

742
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:19,650
business supply chains are very

743
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:23,410
interesting method of getting inside of

744
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:28,480
big companies because a company with a

745
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:35,200
50 employees can't afford would like big

746
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:37,930
IT security department in most cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

747
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,930
see like the IT guys doing everything

748
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:44,859
from installing software hardware and

749
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:48,069
doing information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security and these</font>

750
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:51,759
small companies they have access to big

751
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:54,580
targets VPN or some other credentials

752
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,569
but Posada means but they have access to

753
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:59,469
this

754
00:51:55,569 --> 00:52:02,199
big companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they just get inside a</font>

755
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:04,329
small company which you which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

756
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:09,329
easy task and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then get inside big</font>

757
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:12,190
company so and there are a lot of

758
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:15,759
companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are providing this kind</font>

759
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:19,839
of attacks as a service not only

760
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:23,109
companies also i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only attack</font>

761
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:26,529
itself but also a malware yeah we heard

762
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:31,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the feeling finfisher we heard</font>

763
00:52:26,529 --> 00:52:36,849
about NSO group so yeah it's a commodity

764
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:38,890
right now nation-states trying to gather

765
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:40,839
as much intelligence as it possible and

766
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:45,400
they are starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build larger</font>

767
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:49,029
botnets and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you hospitality</font>

768
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:52,329
networks could be an attack vector

769
00:52:49,029 --> 00:52:56,829
especially when it is good when it is

770
00:52:52,329 --> 00:53:02,890
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail oh ho toh and be careful</font>

771
00:52:56,829 --> 00:53:06,969
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using free Wi-Fi so as a</font>

772
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:12,788
conclusion has a conclusion many years

773
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:19,119
ago we said we are here to save<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

774
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:21,819
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a slogan of our company and</font>

775
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:25,569
now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to choose a digital</font>

776
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:30,910
bodyguard so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope this presentation</font>

777
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:34,869
was interesting for you and if you have

778
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:38,709
any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> please contact me I forgot</font>

779
00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:41,079
to add my email but it's a Razzie easy

780
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:47,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yuri dot enemies think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of at Kaspersky</font>

781
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:52,119
com yeah you can find it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can build</font>

782
00:53:47,229 --> 00:53:55,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">it up using schedule from this</font>

783
00:53:52,119 --> 00:54:01,049
conference so do I have some time for

784
00:53:55,150 --> 00:54:01,049
questions yep cool any questions

785
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:35,840
thank you for questions no actually we

786
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:43,190
as you might know kaspersky was a target

787
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:49,070
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> apt attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and resources like I came</font>

788
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:53,800
to to my office after a trip and

789
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:57,980
understood that nobody use emails and

790
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:03,170
nobody use phones and in in a middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

791
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:06,140
our were like workplace it is a desk

792
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:11,510
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pen and paper with some around</font>

793
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:13,970
things and names of suspicious files and

794
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:18,620
the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem was actually said</font>

795
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:21,140
there were no persistence on infected

796
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:26,750
machines so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we rebooted</font>

797
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:30,350
machine we the machine was clean and but

798
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:34,930
fully<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-persistent like finalists</font>

799
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:38,450
malware it can be a full achieved by

800
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:42,350
attackers that if they know that they

801
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:44,600
can easily penetrate you once again so

802
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">there these attackers for example they</font>

803
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:50,450
were one hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that they</font>

804
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:53,150
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> which they would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to write</font>

805
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:56,629
in fact system once again it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieved</font>

806
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:59,650
by using<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero days or it is achieved as</font>

807
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:03,770
you said for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example by using</font>

808
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:07,730
vulnerabilities in rotors and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sai staff</font>

809
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:12,110
that is not easily easily monitored and

810
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:14,360
not easily patched yes so we are moving

811
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:15,289
to a world where would there would be a

812
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font>

813
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:25,979
persistent modules on in the network any

814
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:27,930
other questions if you're in the second

815
00:56:25,979 --> 00:56:34,069
floor you gotta yell because we can't

816
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:34,069
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you oh yeah or you can jump down you</font>

817
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay actually yes the easy maybe they</font>

818
00:56:51,809 --> 00:57:01,940
can't go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bark but they can use</font>

819
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:04,859
infected systems as a debacle also their

820
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:09,089
documentation is freely available so

821
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:15,089
they can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus they can get</font>

822
00:57:09,089 --> 00:58:04,890
developer versions and use it to debug

823
00:57:15,089 --> 00:58:08,569
malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for question as I</font>

824
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:14,538
said is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no easy solution yeah</font>

825
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:17,579
I'm like a threat intelligence guys but

826
00:58:14,539 --> 00:58:21,779
most effective way is to have several

827
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:24,119
layers of protection certainly and like

828
00:58:21,779 --> 00:58:25,580
you can just switch on 1 way switch off

829
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:30,270
one layer and

830
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:32,520
be secured because attackers will

831
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:34,710
identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have this layer</font>

832
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,170
of security it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can go</font>

833
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:39,740
through this hole to your network when

834
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:47,720
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about monitoring traffic</font>

835
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:52,830
and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases they use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS ssl</font>

836
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:58,109
connection to get the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

837
00:58:52,830 --> 00:59:01,590
network or<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns they worked but what you</font>

838
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:04,110
can do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can change for look for</font>

839
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:06,290
anomalies it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easily</font>

840
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:09,120
implemented but you know it is

841
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented several solutions our</font>

842
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:17,940
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> provides such solution that</font>

843
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:22,550
looks for such anomalies<font color="#E5E5E5"> in network</font>

844
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:25,260
traffic and tries to detect it it called

845
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:28,950
kaspersky anti targeted<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks platform</font>

846
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:34,230
actually so yeah it is possible but you

847
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:38,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to implement some nice logic inside</font>

848
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:44,840
of this system because if your security

849
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:48,930
officer will get like 100 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000</font>

850
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:51,060
notifications like in on second day he

851
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:56,100
will just stop small or watching these

852
00:59:51,060 --> 01:00:02,310
notifications it's very hard to find

853
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:08,880
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very needed and really tied to</font>

854
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:11,270
target to the tech connections and<font color="#E5E5E5"> error</font>

855
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,270
questions

856
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:30,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thanks I adhere like we saw already</font>

857
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">several attacks when for example</font>

858
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:39,098
printers were used as an initial attack

859
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:42,430
vector with us so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> T is growing very</font>

860
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:46,180
fast and it's like a disease<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for</font>

861
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:48,669
security officers like after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

862
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:51,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">University everything looks for you when</font>

863
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:54,190
you first came to office its first shock

864
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:57,390
because you think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your security</font>

865
01:00:54,190 --> 01:01:00,790
perimeter is like server and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

866
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:02,500
work stations but unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

867
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:08,430
not your security perimeter right now

868
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:12,369
with the workstations I like phones

869
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:15,310
different finishes everything and it all

870
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:20,430
generate traffic sand it all connected

871
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:23,589
to internet the worst thing is that

872
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:31,089
consumer electronic life time is very

873
01:01:23,589 --> 01:01:33,549
short<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when when the issues you device</font>

874
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:36,759
on the market the lifetime of these

875
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:39,190
devices like two months after<font color="#CCCCCC"> this the</font>

876
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:42,400
developers of this device they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

877
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:44,290
already doing some new device and if you

878
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,250
will find some vulnerabilities and sent

879
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:51,220
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a vendor vendor would say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok it</font>

880
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:54,970
