<font color="#E5E5E5">conference actually started it when is</font>

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,180
in a really really small room I think

name is Bernhard<font color="#CCCCCC"> rania I work as a</font>

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,578
penetration tester in creation company

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,620
called in fig oh I'm quite involved with

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,320
sense if you go to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the sales</font>

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,419
courses or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> those 25 for 250 for</font>

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,489
you might get to be as a as an

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,260
instructor little hint next year

20
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">Budapest if you want to go there and pay</font>

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,599
money to sense then that's fine with me

22
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:58,109
obviously so the presentation today

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,780
since we are short in time i'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

24
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,879
exactly 30 minutes as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was originally</font>

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,250
supposed to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation today will</font>

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,060
be about security of mobile applications

27
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">i failed a similar presentation a couple</font>

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,549
of months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this one actually has</font>

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,220
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> extended to demonstrate different</font>

30
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,920
categories<font color="#CCCCCC"> of vulnerabilities that we</font>

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,330
have identified in various mobile

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,920
applications in maybe last five years by

33
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,539
nature the majority of mobile

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,030
application that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually tested our</font>

35
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,490
mobile banking applications so i'll be

36
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,250
talking mainly about internet banking

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,929
applications here so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for question</font>

38
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,829
first question for everyone here how

39
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,409
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you do have smartphones the</font>

40
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">majority how many of you to use mobile</font>

41
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,630
banking on your smartphones ok and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,490
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use pin codes on</font>

43
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,439
smartphones these are security company i

44
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,649
hope everyone will raise their hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

45
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,839
or you're too shy this will be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

46
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,579
the main points that we actually verify

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,380
when we are doing a penetration test on

48
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,929
a mobile banking application obviously

49
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,729
besides server-side vulnerabilities

50
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,920
which can be particularly devastating

51
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest issue that we have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

52
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">phones is what happens when you lose it</font>

53
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,610
or what happens when someone steals the

54
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,690
smartphone from you now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

55
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,569
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect</font>

56
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:23,260
against thoroughly and this is something

57
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we pay special attention to as you</font>

58
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see here this was done on</font>

59
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,730
approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 13 mobile banking</font>

60
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,160
applications so we covered preaching

61
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,019
pretty much a lot of the region here as

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,940
well of course the majority of banks are

63
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,100
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Croatia so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

64
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,570
reflect on the status of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile mobile</font>

65
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:42,130
banking applications in in Croatia so

66
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,859
first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduction</font>

67
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,870
what's the problem here obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

68
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,030
devices are with us all the time those

69
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,590
devices are turned on all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time they</font>

70
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,780
keep connecting two different networks

71
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:56,980
anyone connected to the wireless network

72
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,150
here maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dev sec yes no okay thank</font>

73
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much because I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been running</font>

74
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,510
men in the middle whole day and I came

75
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do traffic no I'm just kidding but</font>

76
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,679
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the issues that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

77
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,929
with wireless networks that we connect

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,600
to absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere we connect to</font>

79
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:14,190
3g to 4g whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next generation is</font>

80
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,570
and those devices are constantly online

81
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:20,019
obviously the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that actually</font>

82
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:23,620
separates an attacker who steals the

83
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:26,049
phone from us and our banking account is

84
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,019
actually just a pin code four digits

85
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:32,190
most of the time sometimes six if you're

86
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,690
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky but it'll be generally for</font>

87
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,190
besides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can see that security</font>

88
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,549
tools and mobile devices are very very

89
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,019
limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> I even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though we are on a</font>

90
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,030
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference I bet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can</font>

91
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:45,400
count<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one hand people who actually</font>

92
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,220
have antivirus installed on their mobile

93
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,200
devices if you can if you have iphones

94
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,090
no luck you can't have it at all if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

95
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,940
have n droid maybe you do have some kind

96
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,829
of anti virus but unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

97
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,260
applications are still in very very

98
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">early phases and they cannot even be</font>

99
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,260
compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the antivirus application</font>

100
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:07,600
that you have on our or our desktops so

101
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,720
let's take a look at several issues that

102
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,100
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> with mobile devices and</font>

103
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,470
typically we will divide them into data

104
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,690
at rest and data transit to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

105
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,750
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to parent</font>

106
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">too so today those devices when we</font>

107
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,100
access any application beat mobile

108
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,640
banking<font color="#CCCCCC"> beat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook Twitter whatever</font>

109
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,040
you want those devices are use as

110
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,719
authentication devices obviously on

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,850
facebook we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use our user and</font>

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,580
password and that's maybe not something

113
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:39,300
that we care a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> no they care a lot</font>

114
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,669
about butter<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mobile on mobile banking we</font>

115
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,830
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to use a simple user</font>

116
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,960
name and password why because if someone

117
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">sees that they can log in from another</font>

118
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine right from another mobile phone</font>

119
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,390
we want something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which will be very</font>

120
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific which will be ties to the</font>

121
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,610
device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have as much as possible</font>

122
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,150
so the attacker cannot really replicate

123
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,890
it easily now we can see here<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ded</font>

124
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,380
device will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used as some kind of two</font>

125
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,330
factor authentication obviously the

126
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,200
possession<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the device is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

127
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,580
factor the pin code is the second factor

128
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,950
similarly as we have some kind of a

129
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,990
token like historically<font color="#E5E5E5"> here aggression</font>

130
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,630
most exits opens this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very very</font>

131
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">similar and the programming background</font>

132
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,100
the application that we will have on our

133
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile phones should actually work very</font>

134
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,980
very similarly to those tokens physical

135
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,169
tokens that we hear so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens here</font>

136
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,060
in the background actually like

137
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,070
virtually all mobile banking

138
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,250
applications that we tested so far and

139
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:42,419
this is good thing use some kind of okra

140
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:44,460
or OS open authentication algorithms to

141
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,490
generate the codes which are used to

142
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">untie tickets you to the bank here we</font>

143
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,419
have two<font color="#CCCCCC"> subcategories one are</font>

144
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,230
time-based one-time password the other

145
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,840
one are counter based one-time passwords

146
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,430
so typically banks today use time-based

147
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,500
one-time passwords what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

148
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,780
this means that once you activate your

149
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,950
application you go to some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,380
exchange material exchange session with

151
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bank and once both sides know what</font>

152
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,570
they're talking about the pin is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

153
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,790
only thing that protects the input into

154
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,710
this algorithm so when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> open your</font>

155
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,290
favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> banks mobile banking</font>

156
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,109
application you enter the pin and the

157
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,480
pin is typically used to decrypt some

158
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,690
kind of a secret

159
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,900
which is again used as input to this

160
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:36,110
algorithm for the time based algorithm

161
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,700
we use the secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus time obviously so</font>

162
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,860
it changes every minute or depending on

163
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,080
what the interval is for counter based

164
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,300
algorithms we use the secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font>

165
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,859
actually the sequential number of times

166
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,770
that you authenticated to test to that

167

<font color="#E5E5E5">service previously now these are</font>

168
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,740
typically generated as I said during the

169
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:59,270
mobile banking application activation

170
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,850
process we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will come back later to this</font>

171
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,490
this is just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basic thing that we</font>

172
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to store on the device so obviously</font>

173
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,660
we just don't want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a pin</font>

174
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,640
why remember what I said we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

175
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,530
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font>

application from another mobile device

177
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,210
if it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pin and absolutely</font>

178
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,880
nothing else we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

179
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,580
thing as user name and password

180
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,640
authentication with this if I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

181
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,159
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide with this we actually</font>

182

187
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,910
this way or another and we have two

190
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,100
other thing we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about here</font>

191
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,630
is protection of data in transit so

192
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully all the applications today</font>

193
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,280
will use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of SSL or TLS than</font>

194
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,820
taking for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> words always takes a</font>

195
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,799
ssl although we mean TLS here luckily

196
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,870
most of the vendors are actually pushing

197
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,510
people towards that so April<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

198
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,030
actually start Monday ting TLS version

199
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,340
1.2 if I'm not present wrong from first

200
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,130
of January 2017 they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually push</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ls12</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as mandatory for absolutely</font>

202
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:19,610
everything and you will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

203
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,860
deliberately turn off encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it</font>

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,360
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible just to make some kind</font>

of connection with<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest Android nougat</font>

206
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,410
the nice thing here is that it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

207
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,539
trust user certificate authorities which

208
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,370
are ready to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile phone anymore so</font>

209
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,500
we someone takes your mobile phone for

210
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,000
five minutes adds a malicious

213
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,899
the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application will not trust it</font>

214
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:46,310
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> default you can circumvent this we do</font>

215
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,750
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> penetration testing there's</font>

216
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,189
actually a documented way on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

217
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:53,660
it it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too complex you just add</font>

218
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:55,310
your user edit certificate authority

219
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,930
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> our resource section of the</font>

220
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,310
application but you have to recompile it

221
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,258
and you have to deploy it again on the

222
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,369
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> device so we can see that vendors</font>

223
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,709
are doing something here they're trying

224
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,649
to push more security onto the network

225
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:08,239
layer as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now we have some</font>

226
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,519
kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> background of what we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

227
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,230
worry about data at rest how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we store</font>

228
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,779
the secret how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect the users</font>

229
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,610
pin and data in transit watch what

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:19,370
happens with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data means flow over</font>

231
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Internet or all kind of insecure</font>

232
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,329
networks so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

233
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">most common vulnerabilities that we</font>

234
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:30,138
found in last four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years in</font>

235
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:32,769
those 30 plus applications and let's try

236
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:34,490
to map them to almost top 10 mobile

237
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:36,199
vulnerabilities because I know that

238
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,180
there are a lot of false christs here so

239
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:42,410
they like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm putting over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone or</font>

240
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,939
two slides as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the table that we</font>

241
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,290
have is not completely the same as

242
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:49,579
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> top 10 for us sexually</font>

243
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,920
server-side issues are something that we

244
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:53,870
found most commonly and unfortunately

245
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,389
those can be the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> devastating months</font>

246
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,639
after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have some insecure data</font>

247
00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:01,069
storage and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to say that most</font>

248
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,050
or maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> all applications we tested</font>

249
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:05,420
have proper protection of data in

250
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,670
transit so they do good use<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

251
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,380
encryption to protect the data while

252
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:13,519
it's being sent over the internet so

253
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,259
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> examples worst</font>

254
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,689
case scenario we have a mobile

255
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">application which uses very very strong</font>

256
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:23,000
encryption you takes your pin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> crips</font>

257
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,790
it and stores it locally or great we

258
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,160
have fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption algorithm but</font>

259
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem is that it's the key for</font>

260
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that must be stored somewhere right if</font>

261
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:36,319
you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> tore the users pin encrypted on</font>

262
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,000
the device how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt it the key</font>

263
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:41,089
must be hard coding in the application

264
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,430
very bad somewhat say some might say

265
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:48,290
let's hash it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that way we cannot</font>

266
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:51,199
reverse it good or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not now how long is</font>

267
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,490
the pin four digit six digits how long

268
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:53,209
does it take me to brute-force the debt

269
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,309
on

270
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,529
the most horrible hashing function

271
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:58,939
doesn't matter it won't be too long so

272
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:01,249
we cannot use the simple mechanism to

273
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:03,790
start the data another<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for not</font>

274
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:06,529
using that is that most of the people

275
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,139
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> still do not use pin codes</font>

276
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,550
check your friends check your families

277
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,899
hopefully you do some security

278
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,790
influencing on them so you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

279
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">put them to use pin codes on their</font>

283
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:27,969
was an interesting research by this guy

284
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:32,149
here who was looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these android</font>

285
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:35,899
lock patterns LPS and he actually found

00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,879
out by you know analyzing thousands of a

287
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,459
LPS he found it<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty-four percent of</font>

00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:41,749
them start in the upper left corner it's

289
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:43,809
just something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that people</font>

290
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:46,490
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this here our top six</font>

291
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:50,240
let's top six<font color="#E5E5E5"> LP that people use to</font>

292
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,709
unlock undrained android phones if you

293
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,569
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> android i hope that yours yours is</font>

294
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:55,550
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here or if it is you can say that</font>

295
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:59,569
you have a very secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> LP because it's</font>

296
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:03,349
in top six not so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing here is that</font>

297
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:05,179
we cannot really rely on the fact that

298
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,299
users will<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect their phones we have</font>

299
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:10,009
to do something else here remember the

300
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:13,999
story from the beginning we need to

301
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:17,899
store some kind of a random secret which

302
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:19,730
will be used as input for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> okra</font>

303
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,399
algorithm so let's say it will be time

304
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,619
based as our banks here typically use so

305
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,829
in that activation process we have some

306
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:31,309
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret which should be generated</font>

307
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:34,099
by the device sends to the bank and now

308
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:37,429
the bank and the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the random</font>

309
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,259
secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay random secret plus time is</font>

310
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:41,959
all we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to authenticate to the bank</font>

311
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,509
the question is how do we store the

312
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,388
random secret how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we protect it right</font>

313
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:50,389
it will be like a 20 bytes random<font color="#CCCCCC"> string</font>

314
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:53,629
how do we protect that of course the

315
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:55,879
answer is let's encrypt it right because

316
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:58,279
you know the decryption is impenetrable

317
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,589
and best thing in the world good good

318
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:04,009
way good thinking but the question again

319
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:06,080
is how do we protect the key so the key

320
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,170
to the Crypt that random

321
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:13,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 bytes how do you protect that anyone</font>

322
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:14,959
with any ideas not you Luca you know I'm

323
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,949
gonna throw any ideas you know how to

324
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,780
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay good haha let's see</font>

325
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,760
let's see actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> help how we can do</font>

326
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,670
that so basically what we want to do

327
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,860
here is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use some kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

328
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:34,339
encryption algorithm which will always

329
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:37,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">return some decrypted bites no matter</font>

330
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:41,930
what pin we enter so if you enter good

331
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:44,990
pin we get back good many<font color="#CCCCCC"> bites if you</font>

332
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:48,109
enter a bad pin we get back another 20

333
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,840
bytes which looked completely random but

334
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:54,950
the attacker cannot know that he entered

335
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bed pin the only way to verify it is</font>

336
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,030
to actually calculate the one-time

337
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,340
password and send it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bank so</font>

338
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:04,459
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only way he cannot do offline</font>

339
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,860
good forcing why because every pin will

340
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,480
produce 20 bytes of something and there

341
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,910
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely no way for him to know if</font>

342
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">those 20 bytes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are here not now this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

343
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:16,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the main thing when we try to protect</font>

344
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:19,280
such applications so the only thing that

345
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,709
the attacker actually can do is send the

346
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,630
OTP to the bank and typically at least

347
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,330
with our brain banks in Croatia he has

348
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,950
three tries so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the third time it's</font>

349
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,470
incorrect the bank will lock the account

350
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,200
so they're only three tries for that

351
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:36,860
user to actually test it and that's

352
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,510
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good why because it's same as the</font>

353
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,850
physical talk and we had the physical

354
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,040
talk and we had basically depending on

355
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,540
the pin you know gives us three tries

356
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,730
which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if is still that</font>

357
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,620
physical token we have three tries after

358
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,960
three incorrect attempts the physical

359
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk and locks itself here the bank</font>

360
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,950
locks the user's account the mobile

361
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,740
phone from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point is useless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

362
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,910
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you unlock it and typically for</font>

363
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,800
the unlocking process you have to

364
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,069
reactivate or regenerate that secret

365
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,290
again siren<font color="#CCCCCC"> God is right we stored 20</font>

366
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,900
bytes doesn't matter how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

367
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,689
want to have any pin which will decrypt

368
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,720
something back right so we prevent

369
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,860
offline attacks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> user so what bad</font>

370
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,860
cases did we see here

371
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:22,619
here a couple of examples so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

372
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,529
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I already mentioned you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

373
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:27,959
use 256 bytes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s oh it's the best</font>

374
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:30,509
security encryption algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

375
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,069
world that's really bad you hard coded

376
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:34,739
the kingdom up in the application you

377
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:36,899
don't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other guy said oh you</font>

378
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:40,410
know what I store pin very very secure

379
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,699
securely I use pbk df2 so that's

380
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">password-based key derivation function</font>

381
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:47,699
very slow hashing like function<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

382
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:50,759
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use counter of 1 million</font>

383
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:52,469
times which makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really slow and he</font>

384
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,189
says oh you know what on the latest

385
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,079
iPhone it takes like three seconds to

386
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,579
calculate this so it's very slow you

387
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,128
know I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slow down the</font>

388
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:04,199
attackers not good again how many

389
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:08,639
combinations do I have is a four digit

390
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:10,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">pin 10,000 even if even if it's even if</font>

391
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,720
it's three seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be 30,000</font>

392
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:15,299
seconds who cares I can maybe run

393
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,059
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that so we must not store</font>

394
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:21,179
anything which might show the attacker

395
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:22,919
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he gets something right again I'm</font>

396
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,399
coming back to the original idea we take

397
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,139
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 bytes and we allow any pin to</font>

398
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,619
decrypt them now the problem here is

399
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:34,609
that besides those 20 bytes if we add

400
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:37,589
anything else into the same encrypted

401
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:40,259
structure this means that the attacker

402
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:42,720
might decrypt something he gets 20 bytes

403
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,789
which are which are random<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay he</font>

404
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,039
cannot know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's ok or not but what</font>

405
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:50,279
if our developer decided to concatenate

406
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,049
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> username for example he said I'm going</font>

407
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,059
to protect the user name<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well I will</font>

408
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:57,119
encrypt it as well that's very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

409
00:16:54,059 --> 00:17:00,059
why because now when we use a bad pin we

410
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:01,980
get 20 bytes of random garbage and we

411
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:04,470
get some other garbage behind it if you

412
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,449
know there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a structure here then that</font>

413
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">allows us to brute force the stored</font>

414
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,480
secret and that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad way to</font>

415
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:14,279
store it so what's the status in Croatia

416
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,769
now that you know the vulnerability here

417
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:20,309
I'm happy to say that overall we have

418
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:23,449
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good implementations so while</font>

419
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:25,559
there has been some minor minor

420
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:28,379
vulnerabilities that we identified

421
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:30,110
previously more or less the status here

422
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:32,240
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so all</font>

423
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,760
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> banks actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> store this exactly</font>

424
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,280
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I described they take some random</font>

425

pin to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Crypt only and solid at</font>

427
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,299
random content and that does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not allow</font>

428
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,650
an attacker to run offline attack this

429
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,020
sexually very very good that's something

430
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to be happening in the</font>

431
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,450
future as well we also saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> some bad</font>

432
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:56,270
cases when they accidentally introduced

433
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,510
some structural points and that allows

434
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:03,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">us to actually deduce if the decrypted</font>

435
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:04,730
content is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay or not it doesn't even</font>

436
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to be that we understand all of the</font>

437
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,580
content as long as there is some

438
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:09,639
structure and we can know if it's good

439
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,889
or bad it's good enough for us because

440
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,250
44 pins<font color="#E5E5E5"> six pins we built for that in a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">matter of seconds today the other thing</font>

442
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,970
that we see a lot obviously and which is

443
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:21,980
good although security through obscurity

444
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,290
is generally not good but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

445
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">bad here is that applications get</font>

446
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,700
obfuscating now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this something that we</font>

447
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,679
normally recommend obviously you won't

448
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,540
do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure your application</font>

449
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,730
with this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just make the</font>

450
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,330
analysis process much more complex and

451
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:40,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">time-consuming which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but keep in</font>

452
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,409
mind sometimes people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me oh but we</font>

453
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,389
get our application in for your

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:48,110
penetration test we gave you an up and

455
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,179
unmotivated version so are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we secure no</font>

456
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,399
then they tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me how long how long will</font>

457
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:54,440
it take to will take you to break this

459
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,230
be yours but once you deploy the

460
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,840
application it will be there forever

461
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,100
right until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> release so you</font>

462
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,590
can't rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the fact that this will</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hide something you can see here proguard</font>

467
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:15,049
they look really ugly right difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

468
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,679
read on the right you can see right

469
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:20,480
click in this program here jdx which is

470
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,610
something we typically used to decompile

471
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,220
android applications so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did here</font>

472
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,290
was right click and click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> magic</font>

474
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,428

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">really uh not escape it but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is much</font>

476
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:36,559
easier to read so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can much easier you</font>

484
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,750
there are some commercial packages such

485
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,730
as decks guard which can take this

486
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:59,179
association to the next level and it

487
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,190
makes it makes really really complex job

00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:02,990
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person who is attacking that or</font>

489
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,790
analyzing that application keep in mind

490
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,040
if you're doing a penetration test maybe

491
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:10,490
some of you are for other companies as

492
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,100
well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always tend to ask to give to get</font>

493
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,690
an obfuscated adverse why because we

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trainee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Association can be</font>

496
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,899

497
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,669
this to waste<font color="#CCCCCC"> for weeks on you know</font>

498
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,429
cracking obfuscation and after that

499
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:27,260
actually finding using one week to find

500
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:31,309
vulnerabilities in your application so

501
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:35,330
get something you want to evade now

502
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:37,639
boxing code happen quite often I would

503
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">normally say unless you've seen this</font>

504

presentation before in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular</font>

slide who can tell me what the problem

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:52,129
here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you'll be what you saw the</font>

507
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,960
before you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at all so someone who</font>

508
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,030
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this opportunity haven't seen</font>

509
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,669
this he may be identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue here</font>

510
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:01,220
and this was a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue why because it</font>

511
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:04,880
happened we found this after the

512
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:07,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">application was deployed when it's</font>

513
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,830
already deployed everyone has it on

514
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,900
their mobile phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay since I don't</font>

515
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,049
have a lot of time I'll tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

516
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,309
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and it's not very 64</font>

517
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:18,799
people see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically four and say</font>

518
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:23,149
obey 64 is bed it's not by 64 what

519
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:25,660
happens here is that the developer first

520
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,830
creates a key which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

521
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,809
automatically this is good you know

522
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,600
totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> random key everything by the</font>

523
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:35,418
book all fine then in the next line he

524
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:39,260
wants to create an initialization vector

525
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:41,750
IV but check out the problem is he used

526
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:47,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wrong variable so instead of</font>

527
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:49,520
assigning this too I be here which is

528
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,100
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he wanted to to pass to</font>

529
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> function here i'll be 64 he actually</font>

530
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,830
overrides the key

531
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,680
and every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> application in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

532
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,740
world has the same static key which is

533
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,140
this base64 encoded very very bad thing

534
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,090
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricky to spot and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

535
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,170
typical developer mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

536
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:13,870
happen again our applications are

537
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,250
relatively good obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks to all</font>

538
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available vulnerabilities we</font>

539
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:21,040
found that they fixed but you know

540
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,690
boxing code will happen inevitably we

541
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,020
will miss them developers will miss them

542
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,940
so it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> always actually you know it</font>

543
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,570
cannot be unfortunately avoided the good

544
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:34,480
advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I think that any parts of the</font>

545
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,700
code which actually do some sensitive

546
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,400
crypto related things should be double

547
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,570
triple quadruple checked because you

548
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,950
know you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> double check the</font>

549
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,840
whole application but something which

which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is working with encryption should</font>

551
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,939
we actually double checked here's

maybe you seem hundred manifest files

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,360
and romantic as fast basically define

555
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,950
permissions that the application wants

556
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,899
so once you install<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know that</font>

557
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,430
pop-up comes and says this application

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,100
wants to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to the internet</font>

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is defining an Android manifest file</font>

which comes with application in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

562
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can define so-called intense you can</font>

563
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,080
see one here and then you can say who

564
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,440
can call this intent that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an</font>

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have an intent which is called</font>

pin change I think we can under

568
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:27,190
understand what it does right

569
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,520
unfortunately they open it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font>

world world being your mobile phone what

571
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,560
does this mean this means that another

application on your mobile phone can

573
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,500
actually call this function and change

<font color="#CCCCCC">your pin because the developer</font>

575

incorrectly wrote permissions in the

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:52,090
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just rain come and we start this</font>

578
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and basically on the screen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

579
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,610
window<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pops up and says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font>

580
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:59,200
change the pin so we completely

581
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:01,300
circumvented the part which says enter

582
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,740
the old pin first right we came to the

583
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,540
screen which allows us to change the pin

584
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,830
there are other bad things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

585
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,539
application but this is one of

586
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:12,549
examples that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage the fund and</font>

587
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:14,529
again this was by a huge software

588
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:17,970
security vendor it wasn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> croatian</font>

589
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:20,260
company it was a world-known company and

590
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,090
then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got this to a penetration</font>

591
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,519
test I said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like a golden</font>

592
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,500
company what what will we do here is you

593
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:29,380
know I'm sure that thousands of

594
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,799
penetration testers check this and it

595
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,720
turns out that they actually didn't in

596
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,179
Croatia yay all one hundred percent

597
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,269
tested applications had good permissions

598
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:42,370
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android manifest files we did find</font>

599
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:44,169
some security vulnerabilities in

600
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,600
libraries by other security vendors

601
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:48,789
which means even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though someone Big Mike</font>

602
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,949
um you know to your banker organizations

603
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:53,320
don't blindly trust them doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

604
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,899
they're doing all things correctly and

605
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,700
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's amazing how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many times we</font>

606
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:59,590
have to explain some of the security

607
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,360
things to the big vendors they simply

608
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:05,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get it you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> companies too</font>

609
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,418
big it gets to water down so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

610
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,690
slides and five minutes left and I'll be

611
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:12,519
just on time I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is cool all</font>

612
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">right some clients I detects these are</font>

613
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,850
actually very rare they don't happen all

614
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:21,820
that often but sometimes they do see

615
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:24,428
interesting vulnerabilities which you

616
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,260
actually wouldn't expect so if someone

617
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:27,340
told you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have a cross-site</font>

618
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,440
scripting on your mobile phone

619
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,559
application typically would say like

620
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,669
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it's it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile application how</font>

621
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,350
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have cross-site scripting on</font>

622
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:38,799
mobile application well unfortunately

623
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:40,529
you can why because not all mobile

624
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,929
applications are what they pretend to be

625
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:46,840
sometimes they're actually browsers

626
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:49,809
which are in like you no no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no window</font>

627
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,850
frames that you as a user cannot

628
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:53,980
actually easily see that this is not a

629
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,590
native application that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

630
00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:00,070
browser shell and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application uses</font>

631
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:01,629
HTML Javascript CSS whatever connects to

632
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,730
the server and then displays the data

633
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and on your phone it looks like any</font>

634
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">other like any other application it</font>

635
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:10,689
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know up browser</font>

636
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,899
those applications obviously are

637
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,910
vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any other security</font>

638
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:18,520
vulnerabilities that

639
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,900
are meant for browsers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty sure</font>

640
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have good</font>

641
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,990
presentation tomorrow about cross-site

642
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,020
scripting so you'll see what what we can

643
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,190
have in mobile applications as well so

644
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,870
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one example of such an</font>

645
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,490
application we were testing internet

646
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,189
banking application and we had two

647
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:36,820
channels mobile and standard web based

648
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:38,830
internet browsing internet banking

649
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,110
application and the funny thing was that

650
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,270
the browser-based interface was

651
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,310
completely secure we were not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

652
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything so we put some cross-site</font>

653
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:50,379
scripting it was correctly encoded when

654
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,410
being displayed back to us but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

655
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,700
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the same web page web page which</font>

656
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,680
you don't see really with your mobile

657
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,500
application to just click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on one window</font>

658
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,600
and you go there that embedded code

659
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,060
comes back and gets executed on the

660
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile phone and released you can do bad</font>

661
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,950
things which bad things well<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

662
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,740
permissions the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application has</font>

663
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,900
asked for we can actually run through

664
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:17,500
this if the mobile applications has

665
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,810
asked for a camera we can in theory

666
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:24,190
enable camera why would mobile banking

667
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:26,110
application ask for camera barcode

668
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,240
scanning QR code scanning so all of them

669
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,820
say I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need camera access sure there we</font>

670
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,040
go I'll give it I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the</font>

671
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,230
best feature I'll have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature so</font>

672
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,360
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can use the camera right so</font>

673
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything you can use we can use from</font>

674
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">this interface</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so just for last</font>

675
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,730
couple of slides data in transit again

676
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,669
as I said almost all tested applications

677
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,740
use SSL which is really good one of the

678
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,680
recommendations here is normally to do

679
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:56,980
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of certificate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pinning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

680
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,260
started seeing that developers started

681
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,350
using certificate pinning there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

682
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,670
let's say weird implementations maybe

683
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't kill me by some of the vendors</font>

684
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,980
which are present here as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I must</font>

685
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:12,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">not name them so they use some kind of</font>

686
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:15,760
like ssl simulation let's call it that

687
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:17,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">way which works okay maybe the problem</font>

688
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,750
with that particular approach is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

689
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,970
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to the more some new</font>

690
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">burner ability gets published for that</font>

691
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:26,800
algorithm or encryption algorithm then

692
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,600
that particular vendor has to fix it if

693
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,350
it's if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to always provided</font>

694
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,510
libraries

695
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:34,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">I pictured it like April will fix it</font>

696
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:37,360
before but this is generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

697
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,809
the worst thing ever server-side attacks

698
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,129
now it looks unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we got</font>

699
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:47,129
back to year two thousand so some of the

700
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:49,720
vulnerabilities that I never saw before

701
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,580
like we always in the company we always

702
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,590
have a joke you know have you tried

703
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,840
doing negative transactions like

704
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:58,539
transferring minus 100 years to another

705
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,059
account and the joke is typically that

706
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:02,919
never works and actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

707
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:05,350
remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ever worked until</font>

708
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,059
mobile applications came back and for

709
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,149
some reason you know developers again

710
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:11,590
consider them to be completely closed

711
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:14,110
environments no one can<font color="#CCCCCC"> change anything</font>

712
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,370
no one can change my parameters I can

713
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,469
trust everything that comes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

714
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:21,219
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and then just leave their</font>

715
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:23,559
system wide open we saw all sorts all

716
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,809
sorts of scary bugs here and I mean

717
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:28,059
really really scary so they range from

718
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:30,460
like silly information leaking

719
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:32,770
vulnerabilities nothing very bad to

720
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,780
high-risk direct object reference owner

721
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:37,360
abilities sure I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a window where i</font>

722
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,820
can download my statements list from my

723
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,559
bank<font color="#CCCCCC"> I changed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the number i get someone</font>

724
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,080
else's statement please from the bank

725
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:46,059
let's pretty pretty bad but for

726
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,668
developer he doesn't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> how he doesn't</font>

727
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:50,110
know how you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> change it it's not that</font>

728
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:51,640
straightforward to intercept the traffic

729
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,500
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile device but it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not too</font>

730
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,530
complex either we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it relatively</font>

731
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,299
easily and this is the best the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

732
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,799
divorce depending from each point of

733
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:01,510
view for us doing the test it's always

734
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,820
the best for the developers not so much

735
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,830
now some critical privilege escalation

736
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,750
what kind of privilege escalation well

737
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,449
maybe the application at one point after

738
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,070
i authenticate properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get some data</font>

739
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,169
back from the server the application

740
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:17,799
sends it back and the data is my ID

741
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:20,080
number user ID number what happens if i

742
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:24,190
change it oh look<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get someone else's</font>

743
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,110
account full total control why did maybe

744
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,150
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did this happen in the first</font>

745
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,309
time maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy's just</font>

746
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:33,100
telling us<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs clear that can never</font>

747
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:35,289
exist it can because in complex

748
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,959
environments that we have now so we have

749
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:39,879
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those different digital channels</font>

750
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,679
you add mobile applications and you want

751
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,470
to make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> work as quick as possible</font>

752
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,190
quite often there are weird interfaces

753
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:50,679
between different components in the

754
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,600
system and maybe the different

755
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:56,159
developers build those components and

756
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,719
their expectation is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the other guy</font>

757
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,010
implemented security controls and this

758
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,710
one says all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other guy will check</font>

759
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,240
this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you know how it ends up no</font>

760
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,600
one checks what's going in and

761
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:13,090
unfortunately this category is most

762
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:15,428
common and can be most most critical so

763
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:19,360
I guess there will probably be more to

764
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:22,870
come we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the future will</font>

765
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,879
develop here there is obviously some you

766
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,668
know movement forward and I said

767
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,419
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all those ssl/tls</font>

768
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:31,330
vulnerabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the last couple of</font>

769
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:33,850
years a lot of organizations are paying

770
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,860
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to network traffic and I can</font>

771
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:39,279
see that it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting much</font>

772
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:42,189
better but i'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we'll</font>

773
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,409
have our hands busy for quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time</font>

774
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:48,580
in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disagrees with</font>

775
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:51,779
me okay so um thanks everyone thanks to

776
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:54,879
the guy who made<font color="#E5E5E5"> me speak in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> english and</font>

777
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:57,820
yeah if you have any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here</font>

778
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">now later whenever yeah due to the time</font>

779
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:05,678
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will accept one question so if there's</font>

780
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:06,820
anyone with one<font color="#CCCCCC"> question go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

781
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:19,450
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the mic because of the</font>

782
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:21,820
recordings okay my question regards the

783
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:26,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">client-side basically so on the mobile</font>

784
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:29,500
phone the bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was previously in the</font>

785
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,990
application once you exit from it and

786
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,730
leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone and someone takes it</font>

787
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,830
they can log back into the application

788
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,210
without typing the pin simple because

789
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,449
it's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the memory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's always</font>

790
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:42,340
active<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see you didn't mention that but</font>

791
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,500
yeah that's that's actually one of the

792
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,449
good points so typically you know on the

793
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,710
phone when you click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the button you</font>

794
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">just put the application in the</font>

795
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:53,030
background it you don't really log out

796
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,760
so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we give to you</font>

797
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,160
know businesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

798
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to log out your users every time</font>

799
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,510
they click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this button and most of</font>

800
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,330
the banks actually say you know no leave

801
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:07,550
them leave them logged in but maybe put

802
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,169
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a timeout on the session so</font>

803
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,270
if there is no traffic from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

804
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:13,250
user for like three minutes right then

805
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:15,200
kill his session and typically it will

806
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,330
be very short<font color="#E5E5E5"> time interval maybe 60</font>

807
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,360
seconds three minutes not more than five

808
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:22,460
minutes and the new applications I saw

809
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,570
that some banks here in Croatia use it

810
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,810
and I actually really like the feature

811
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,100
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like on an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone when you</font>

812
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,750
click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the button and you know when</font>

813
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,520
you're gonna scroll to the applications

814
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,950
you know how it works it actually makes

815
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,230
screenshots of applications right of

816
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,910
every win w have here when you put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

817
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,130
the background iphone creates a

818
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:42,470
screenshot of that application and it

819
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,060
stores it on the phone so when you

820
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,130
double click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the button and you want</font>

821
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,570
to scroll to the applications you see

822
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">all those nice open windows they're</font>

823
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,899
actually screenshots right and what can

824
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">be on the screen shot you can have</font>

825
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,620
critical information on the screen shot

826
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you won't have a pin but maybe some</font>

827
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,879
big transaction that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you made the summer</font>

828
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want anyone to see so I</font>

829
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,410
saw that some banks here in Croatia

830
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,540
actually use the feature that the iOS

831
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:08,510
provides which you blew<font color="#E5E5E5"> that screenshot</font>

832
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,889
so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't see what it is but</font>

833
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,230
most of the cases here it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

834
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">60 23 minutes time out for for for that</font>

835
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,070
feature and that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that's a</font>

836
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,960
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point something people should be</font>

837
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,610
aware of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just click this</font>

838
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,860
button you didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> log out you</font>

839
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:25,250
know it still is still alive so thanks

840
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,840
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question thank you I just</font>

841
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know why we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> banks</font>

842
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,879
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time as an example you can you</font>

843
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,090
can look at my bank account but my

844
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,699
tinder account I don't know about that

845
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:41,659
well fair enough I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to put a joke</font>

846
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:43,009
on me for once today's if Akane because

847
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,690
most of the penetration<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests we</font>

848
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,310
actually did are for financial industry

849
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:50,110
so there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> like ninety-five</font>

850
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:54,370
percent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're more sensitive so</font>

851
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:54,370
thank you get it thanks

852
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,060
you
