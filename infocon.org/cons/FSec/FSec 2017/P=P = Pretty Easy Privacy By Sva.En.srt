1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,080
so yeah I'm and I want to tell you about

2
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:15,370
pretty easy privacy here you can find

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,000
the contacts email web Twitter IRC these

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,180
things

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,560
thanks to F SEC for inviting me I was

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,990
actually in contact with about con

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,710
people I will also mention this later

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,799
that's a conference next week and it's

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,240
very interesting to be here thank you so

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,699
pretty easy privacy is a project that

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,850
stands at the very beginning of rolling

12
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:38,320
out privacy by default for everyone you

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,070
might have guessed that the name comes

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,390
from PGP pretty good privacy so who

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:50,800
knows about PGP yeah that's nearly

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:56,500
everyone was using it okay who's using a

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:59,399
daily here you see we really need to

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,340
need to get the pretty easy mode going

19
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:07,450
as this is also a bit of a corporate

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:12,640
thing event who was trying to rule out

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:16,000
PGP in a company no one okay who's

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,950
planning to do so but who's from a

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,610
company though okay alright so then I

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:27,729
can skip this one and I read he go into

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:30,789
the talk so I'll be making an intro then

26
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:33,250
I introduced you the technology of path

27
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,979
then the concept which is I guess the

28
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,110
longest chapter and then briefly the

29
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:40,570
organization and then depending on how

30
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,789
much time is gonna be left the current

31
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:46,210
implementation and some demos of apps

32
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:49,930
and yeah please interrupt me any time

33
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:54,548
with questions and also if I'm talking

34
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:56,560
too fast or something Edward Snowden

35
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,110
said I don't want to live in a world

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,170
where everything that I say everything I

37
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:04,570
do everyone I talk to every expression

38
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:09,369
of creativity or love or friendship is

39
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:11,799
recorded I agree and the problem is we

40
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:16,349
do live in such a world now it's not

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,349
only this it's also that

42
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:23,299
so there is a problem that most

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,910
communication online is visible like a

44
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,100
postcard and this world has mass

45
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,680
surveillance so what we need is mass

46
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,510
encryption that's what we're trying to

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,420
do that's just a starting point because

48
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:41,480
we also try to do have mass analyzation

49
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:44,540
getting rid of all the metadata so again

50
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,269
just the starting point we just started

51
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,090
and we see ourselves as cypher punks

52
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,850
and we want to optimize the costs of

53
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,980
mass surveillance not only privacy for

54
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:59,120
citizens but also security for

55
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:02,119
businesses cypherpunks do write copes at

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,180
code it's a group making the networks

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,240
safer they defined once

58
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,020
privacy is necessary for an open society

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,940
in the electronic age privacy is not

60
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,730
secrecy a private matter is something

61
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,340
one doesn't want the whole world to know

62
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:23,899
but a secret matter is something one

63
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:26,090
doesn't want anybody to know in true

64
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,700
also includes my person he already read

65
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:32,000
out loud most of it so I'm originally

66
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,170
coming from the humanities and I'm also

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
a stroller

68
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,790
it's just Ola carpenter there is no

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,100
English word so I'm trying to use the

70
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:44,840
Croatian word my name is VY is a unique

71
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,260
addressing in the internet and in the

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,140
web my legal name is also a unique ID

73
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,609
that's why I'm trying not to use it you

74
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,399
can find it out if you check on the

75
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,440
board members of the associations on the

76
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,890
right hand side if you're really curious

77
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,130
and I'm also yeah organizer and a blur

78
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:07,369
various hack events check events or

79
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,140
immediacy ççde and Hill hacks

80
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,200
that's in the Himalayas you're very

81
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,149
invited to come and you've really

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,350
invited to come over to welcome next

83
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,810
week

84
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,810
that's a new visit in Serbia not far

85
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,560
away next weekend

86
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:26,440
yeah I already met people here who

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,360
didn't know about this event so you

88
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,400
should definitely get to know about it

89
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,889
and maybe even come it's at the weekend

90
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,510
so you can just come on Saturday Sunday

91
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:39,430
as well but now let's get started

92
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,260
technology I briefly explained the

93
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,870
architecture which consists of

94
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,320
applications adapters and and the engine

95
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,940
then I show you a list of ripples

96
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,230
repositories and a list of developing

97
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:56,080
platforms and yeah so that's the basic

98
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,960
architecture so we always have an

99
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,930
application that does things so in this

100
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,710
case right see like is an email client

101
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,840
at the moment it's mainly email clients

102
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:11,739
and then it's connected with an adapter

103
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,260
to the engine the engine is like an API

104
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,150
that serves the crypto and the key

105
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,940
management functions and knows about the

106
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,219
transport protocols but I'm going into

107
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,750
this more detail in the next slides so

108
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,580
on the right hand side you see the

109
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,790
example of Outlook on top you have the

110
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,820
outlook plug-in or add-on or whatever

111
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,590
it's called an outlook and then you have

112
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,650
the comm server adapter which you need

113
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:40,060
for this and which connects then the

114
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:42,250
pipe engine into outlook so applications

115
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,140
we have at the moment this outlook

116
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:49,350
add-in an Android canine fork and

117
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,330
thunderbird which is an early alpha and

118
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,870
when alpha and apep for iOS which is

119
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:58,780
even earlier alpha there's more to come

120
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,160
we just started our main tech leads is

121
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,539
still hoping that someone would be

122
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,510
implementing it into mutt

123
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:08,080
it's Python so it's all there Cammi

124
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:10,180
listen pipe then we need browser plugins

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,530
if we really want to reach out to the

126
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,280
people out there because they're not

127
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,619
using email clients unfortunately maybe

128
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,869
you want to suggest your mail client if

129
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,630
you're a developer even more come and

130
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,360
talk to me and then it should also go

131
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,080
into other communication like

132
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,790
interpersonal communication application

133
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,669
applications like SMS like jabber XMPP

134
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:39,390
Facebook Twitter whatever private

135
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:44,430
messenger people use out there because

136
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:46,740
it's about mass encryption at the moment

137
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,200
the current implementation handles open

138
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,270
PGP and s/mime without any hassle for

139
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,120
the users so it automatically encrypts

140
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,190
it encrypts the subject inline there's

141
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,950
no key management needed there is no key

142
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,270
server any other centralized

143
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,490
infrastructure fingerprints are

144
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,620
translated into trust words there's an

145
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,820
opt-in passphrase for keys so by default

146
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,830
there is no password and header is going

147
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,320
to be encrypted and obfuscated that's

148
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,930
for the next version and also the PAP

149
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:21,060
sync but I'll be going into some of it

150
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:23,340
more detail so the adapter is a language

151
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,750
environment specific interface between

152
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,929
the engine API in an application

153
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,390
development environment so this may be a

154
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,810
language or it could be an IDE or

155
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:36,419
whatever there's a list there comes over

156
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,540
adapter already mentioned there is this

157
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:42,420
Java thing for Android they as a JSON

158
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:45,240
adapter there's an object see there's a

159
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:50,780
Python adapter there's a QT adapter so

160
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:53,820
we try to have all the common stuff

161
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:56,549
solved for the moment if you see

162
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,940
something missing please let me know but

163
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:03,870
there's also more in progress so this

164
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,300
adapter makes calls no the app makes

165
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,270
calls to the adapter for the function at

166
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,000
once which can be please encrypt the

167
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,669
message please decrypt the message or

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,460
make mime encoding please get the trust

169
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:20,070
words or verify the identity or decide

170
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,070
on the trustless level for the identity

171
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:26,370
or this particular message I have here

172
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:28,320
now as an application then the adapter

173
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,170
converts that into normalized

174
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,120
standardized and into a form like

175
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,599
standardized form for the engine and

176
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,120
makes then the C library call then

177
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,219
engine magic is happening and the

178
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,560
adapter gives the result back to the

179
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:46,070
application

180
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,650
here's another diagram on the right you

181
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,380
see the outlook again like outlook you

182
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,449
have the plug-in and then you have this

183
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:58,160
comm server adapter which then goes down

184
00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:02,270
to the engine then on the very left you

185
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:05,360
see the KDE to KDE mail clients which

186
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:08,030
use this like KT specific stuff and then

187
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,740
the Qt adapter and then in the middle

188
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,100
there is Thunderbird and annek mail

189
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,200
which are for all platforms and then go

190
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,740
they use this jason-- jason-- adapter

191
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,960
and go into all those platforms and then

192
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,760
again use the engine now the engine that

193
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,190
one takes care of the messaging

194
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,400
functions the cryptic text services is

195
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,440
like a trip to API and makes the fully

196
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,660
automated key management services and

197
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,610
the trust rating it knows about the

198
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,400
transport protocols the message

199
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,680
transports in the future it shall also

200
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,829
do the metadata protection by agnew net

201
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,810
as a developer you can just plug and

202
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,720
play and you don't have to care for

203
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:53,479
crypto so the pretty easy is not only

204
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,780
for the user who at the end by the way

205
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,600
if we look at this outlook plug-in the

206
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,720
person who uses outlook installs PAP and

207
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,300
afterwards the person still just writes

208
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,460
email there's nothing that changes but

209
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,939
the email will be encrypted so there is

210
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,350
no hassle it was mentioned that I'm

211
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,570
coming from the crypto party movement

212
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,570
lots of us are coming from the crypto

213
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:20,570
Party movement and usually explaining

214
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,980
vpg and installing it on devices we

215
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,970
usually did this with Thunderbird and

216
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,640
any mail took at least one hour usually

217
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:32,480
you were counting to when you made the

218
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,220
plan two hours to get whatever usually

219
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,950
it's like 20 people in a normal crypto

220
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,650
party to get them all GPG going it takes

221
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:42,320
two hours with PAP it's gonna be like

222
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:44,870
tor browser like install and use it and

223
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,280
there's also you don't even have to

224
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:50,180
understand what you're doing anymore

225
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,449
which also is a problem but I come to

226
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:56,900
this later but to come back as a

227
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,790
developer it's also pretty easy so there

228
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,689
would be developers who would be sitting

229
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,449
there after

230
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,060
or should and should do something and

231
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,970
then they're checking on a search engine

232
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,530
okay how to do crypto and after half an

233
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,720
hour they're like oh my god I'm not

234
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,760
doing this so hopefully they'll be

235
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,670
finding out about pep in the future and

236
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,460
say okay great this is my adapter and

237
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,729
all I have to do is to care for the

238
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:25,070
interface between my application and the

239
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:29,240
adapter and everything has been taken

240
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:31,100
care of Pat and then all you need to do

241
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,200
is to trust us

242
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,970
that's there but we're doing code audits

243
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,290
it's all open source you can also check

244
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:41,060
it out yourself the engine does the

245
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,270
decryption the encryption the mime

246
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:47,180
encoding decoding the message processing

247
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:49,220
for the adapter which we already had the

248
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,729
key management which means generation

249
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,190
verification also blacklisting if needed

250
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:58,580
like we all know these people who have

251
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,950
their keys lost and then the like moi

252
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,740
your mail client always takes the one

253
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,710
which is actually lost so you should

254
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,390
also have the option to blacklist keys

255
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,840
then also key synchronization between

256
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,780
devices on the same account which is a

257
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:17,330
rather big thing so far I think only

258
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,949
Apple is able to do that but only if you

259
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:23,870
use their clout and whatever and the

260
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,790
engine drives several crypto standards

261
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,890
on different digital channels like

262
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,010
different message transport protocols

263
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:33,050
it's written in c99 it's roughly nine

264
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,210
thousand eight hundred lines of code it

265
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,219
has regular code out it's one has

266
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,350
already been published and feel very

267
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,300
happy to have more people having a look

268
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:47,600
so it's not too much this is the list of

269
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:53,420
repos in the middle you see most of the

270
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:56,270
adapters there is the PAP engine there's

271
00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:00,740
the engine there is this net PGP which

272
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:02,449
is a fork of the iOS net PGP then there

273
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,360
is the Internet drafts we also started

274
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:09,680
an RFC that comes later and yeah

275
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,620
different things which are used and if

276
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,540
you look at the UL so you already see

277
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,070
where we're coming from everything is

278
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:20,420
reachable on CA cert and let's encrypt

279
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,190
but if you don't want to remember those

280
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,020
who are else you can just go to pat dot

281
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,590
foundation and then click on PAP

282
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:31,360
software and then you can get a list

283
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:33,860
where you get let into the rebels and

284
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,650
here are the platforms we're developing

285
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,290
on iOS Android Linux BSD Mac OS and

286
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:42,199
Windows so it's everything because we

287
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,120
want to reach mass encryption the point

288
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,570
of mass encryption at one point so we

289
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,760
need to do everything so it's quite a

290
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,080
task especially in the developer team if

291
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,689
you have Windows people sitting together

292
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:58,640
with BSD people and Linux people it's

293
00:13:53,690 --> 00:14:05,960
always fun okay next chapter the

294
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:09,020
concepts that's six points privacy by

295
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,450
default we're also show you the RFC we

296
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,449
started as a draft I briefly mentioned

297
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,210
then pretty easy privacy well to explain

298
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,180
the key sync protocol briefly and the

299
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,610
concept of trust words then the chapter

300
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:26,089
peer-to-peer an end-to-end free software

301
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:33,440
compatibility and anonymity where it's

302
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:37,430
about canoe net okay pep does what the

303
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,410
user would want to do by teaching at all

304
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,459
those crypto parties and writing all

305
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:46,640
those how tools we were just like why

306
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,650
like why don't we just stop explaining

307
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,170
it all the people and instead we write

308
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:54,110
all the stuff into protocols and have

309
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,699
software actually doing it so instead of

310
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,710
writing how-to guides we write user

311
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,560
expectations into software and protocols

312
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:03,350
to autumn eyes ultimate eyes all steps a

313
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,359
user would need to carry out so we

314
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,700
started an internet draft together with

315
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,620
the eye sock Switzerland on the general

316
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,320
path principles its online and ready for

317
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:16,670
discussion I guess I can upload the

318
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,380
slides somewhere later for the UL so the

319
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,839
operations that are going to be

320
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,680
automatized is the key management key

321
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,410
discovery

322
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,250
and key sink that's the the main the

323
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:30,290
main features this is how such a draft

324
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,110
looked like I guess everyone has seen it

325
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:36,649
before this is a zoom in into the

326
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,360
abstract and this is the table of

327
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,339
contents I also have it here in a

328
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,920
printout if someone wants to have a

329
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:48,260
closer look next part of the concept is

330
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,630
pretty easy privacy we want to make

331
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,939
privacy easy easy to install easy to

332
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,310
understand easy to use no hassle no

333
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:59,570
training needed and also easy for app

334
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:01,699
devs I think nothing else that I need to

335
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,620
say it's a big goal but we already I

336
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,500
think we already reached it with the

337
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,630
outlook plug-in and the the rest is all

338
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,660
better and Alpha's so I cannot really

339
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,910
say that this is really true

340
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:17,449
one part to make it easy is to translate

341
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:20,060
the hexadecimal based fingerprints into

342
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:23,360
trust words so it's battery horse staple

343
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,810
instead of EC five five three nine c8 f

344
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:31,339
ec F which you have to read out loud on

345
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:33,279
the phone so that we hope they make

346
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:36,850
things more convenient for people

347
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:40,700
because this is the only step we cannot

348
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:43,160
put into software trust you can only

349
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,920
establish by looking into someone's eyes

350
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,089
or listening to a fingerprint on a phone

351
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,569
and so this is what people really need

352
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:56,300
to do if they want to really verify the

353
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:59,209
contact they can still write each other

354
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,479
encrypted emails without verifying like

355
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:05,510
I would say most of us do with Oh Tara

356
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,880
are in dropper or ISC when we started

357
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,470
our session there's also like this yeah

358
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,000
you know you have to verify the

359
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,329
fingerprints and we all like yes yes

360
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,920
verified it's okay let me go on so there

361
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,470
we also don't do it so we haven't

362
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,809
verified the partner but if we're taking

363
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,510
it serious between times do we call each

364
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,970
other and read out loud the fingerprints

365
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:30,320
so instead of finger prints now we say

366
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:33,559
battery horse staple yeah

367
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,090
the next part to make it easy is the pep

368
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,370
sync protocol

369
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:41,120
to use the same keys on multiple devices

370
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:43,070
we all know this hassle like I'm just on

371
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,229
the phone at the moment and I don't know

372
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,779
like I don't want to put my keys on my

373
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:51,770
Android and I don't know how to do that

374
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:54,830
so please write me again were write me

375
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:58,490
on OTR and Jabbar because that reaches

376
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:03,770
me on the phone so we are trying to have

377
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:06,080
an pep sync to get rid of this problem

378
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,429
so that people can really use it and

379
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,049
that it's not something like you can

380
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:11,539
only use it on your desktop machine

381
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:13,100
which people anyway don't use too much

382
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:14,840
anymore

383
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,480
this is realized with the help of device

384
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,480
groups and I've rather rather explained

385
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,720
it with that picture so a new device

386
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,909
generates a device key and then the new

387
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,690
device pings with this one in the device

388
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:33,130
group and then existing devices and the

389
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:36,649
user verify the new device with these

390
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:40,880
trust words as well they make the

391
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:45,500
handshake and then they agree on a

392
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:48,320
secret main group key and then all these

393
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,450
- all devices exchanged their secret

394
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,330
keys and then they you have this link

395
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,490
main group key which is the one which

396
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,949
external partners can communicate to

397
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:02,450
where it can be distributed on all the

398
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:05,809
devices that means you can also use your

399
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:08,890
own computer to sync your keys your

400
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:12,860
contacts and your calendar as well and

401
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:16,159
instead of using the cloud which is just

402
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:19,490
others people's computers right so you

403
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,559
can use your own and ideally you only

404
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,960
lose your phone and not all your devices

405
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:27,678
if you lose all your devices than your

406
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:31,309
anyway screwed this is a real-life

407
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:34,580
screenshot from testing of the sync

408
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:37,879
protocol not released yet will be coming

409
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,370
with a version two next part of the

410
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,570
concept and trends peer-to-peer like

411
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,399
end-to-end encryption peer-to-peer

412
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,260
transport and no centralized

413
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:47,840
infrastructure or any kind of closed

414
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,620
services we don't want

415
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,570
creates any like yet another crypto app

416
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,340
that you can only use with your friends

417
00:19:53,570 --> 00:20:00,590
which you have to first persuade to

418
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,149
install this thing again and then half a

419
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,459
year later it breaks and then you need

420
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:10,160
to convince them to install something

421
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:13,970
else and we try to stay out of this it's

422
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:18,350
for sure compatible with every other GPG

423
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:21,950
and PGP implementations out there which

424
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:24,110
is there since the early 90s so we hope

425
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,690
that we're not like we don't want to

426
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:30,770
reinvent the wheel as written in the

427
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,300
abstract and yeah also here we want to

428
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,690
do things right it's not only end-to-end

429
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:40,129
and peer-to-peer it's also free software

430
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:42,260
its GPL and we just recently got the

431
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,610
acknowledgement from mr. Richard

432
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:49,960
Stallman to actually have this as well

433
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:52,070
in other licenses so because

434
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,800
applications like on the application

435
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,540
layer we want to talk to every

436
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:02,659
application and then with the GPL

437
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:05,889
sometimes you cut yourself out peppers

438
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:09,800
regular independent external code audits

439
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:12,350
also mentioned already then the

440
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,850
compatibility so there is multiple group

441
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,070
to technologies multiple message

442
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:20,530
transports multiple platforms multiple

443
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:23,780
languages going to be as supported and

444
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,850
this is an example of the crypto the

445
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,129
bolted part is already implemented but

446
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,230
then what our memo signal protocol

447
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:34,010
axolotl and whatever is going to be hip

448
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,840
will be implemented again not yet

449
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:39,980
another crypto app but being compatible

450
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,810
with everything that already exists same

451
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,330
for transport protocols at the moment

452
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:48,350
all the email stuff is implemented

453
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:50,389
exchange IMAP SMTP pop 3 then XMPP is

454
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,030
most probably gonna be the next one and

455
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:57,020
then Dean on open standards which I

456
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:59,950
guess very fun to look at but it'll be

457
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,560
important to really create the

458
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,770
the goal of mass encryption because

459
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:11,290
that's what the people use and then unit

460
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:13,240
and even down to SMS anonymity content

461
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,310
encryption is not everything we all know

462
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,650
that for email metadata stays visible

463
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:20,620
from the to the eyepiece where you're

464
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:25,480
sending from the subject the size of the

465
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:29,110
email so we're trying already to at this

466
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,180
point of time to encrypt to obfuscate

467
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,750
and encrypt the rest of the header as

468
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:37,900
much as possible and encrypt the subject

469
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:40,300
in line which is pretty easy so it's

470
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,000
just the first line in the body is the

471
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,010
subject then and every pepp client and

472
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,720
hopefully other email clients as well in

473
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,610
the future will be able to interpret

474
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,210
that if in the first line of the body

475
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:55,149
there is written subject column word

476
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,720
that word means subject and that in the

477
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,310
client

478
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,460
you better be having it in the subject

479
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:02,230
again which I find very convenient yeah

480
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,700
teaching all of those crypto parties you

481
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,960
always have to tell the people not to

482
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,360
use any subjects anymore

483
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,550
or at least subjects which don't have

484
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,770
anything to do with the email which is

485
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,870
then very inconvenient when you're

486
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,910
scrolling through your emails and you

487
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,219
have this like encrypted encrypted fubar

488
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:23,830
fubar emails and you don't know where's

489
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:27,850
the one you're looking for but that's

490
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,770
only a small thing to encrypt or yeah

491
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,699
encrypt the subject and obfuscate the

492
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:36,520
header we're also trying to solve this

493
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,560
problem from the root so to get rid of

494
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,440
the metadata we want to pipe everything

495
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,750
through guru net at one point unit is

496
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,610
this project from academia started in

497
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:51,820
2002 with the first white paper and to

498
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:55,330
explain it I use this analogy of the

499
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:58,179
Internet 1.0 in the 70s and the 80s

500
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,189
where everyone was like wow I can access

501
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,290
your computer and you can check out mine

502
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,450
how awesome is that

503
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,550
right this is how it was in the 70s and

504
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,920
the 80s they connected to computers to

505
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,860
each other and it was amazing that you

506
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,600
could from this point at access a

507
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:19,990
computer which is on the other side

508
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:22,120
in the world nowadays in the year 2017

509
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:25,840
we are like sure I can access other

510
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,668
computers like what's this and I can use

511
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,020
their services and all this but wait

512
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:34,690
what they can also access mine and what

513
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:38,429
we're trying to have is the Internet 2.0

514
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:41,350
which is gonna take quite some more time

515
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:44,230
and trend encryption and Animas ation of

516
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,389
the way data flows so this is this

517
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,299
project it's has the attack line you

518
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:53,140
broke the internet let's make a new one

519
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:55,480
unit org which is a mesh routing layer

520
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,600
for end-to-end encrypted networking and

521
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,240
a framework for distributed applications

522
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,480
designed to replace the old insecure

523
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:08,590
internet protocol stack so what they're

524
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,559
doing is to replace tcp/ip and

525
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,240
everything above unit wants to become a

526
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:15,010
widely used reliable open

527
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,990
non-discriminating egalitarian

528
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,500
unfettered and censorship resistant

529
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:22,240
system of free information exchange and

530
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,100
serve as a platform as a development

531
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,620
platform for the next generation of

532
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:32,280
decentralized internet protocols yeah

533
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:34,989
that's a big rather big task to rewrite

534
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,928
tcp/ip and everything which comes after

535
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:40,419
it but they already on it since 15 years

536
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,490
is this like university thing where

537
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:44,620
there's a lot of PhDs written and master

538
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:49,870
thesis is and working groups in la-la

539
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:54,280
la-la-la and now they're kinda done as

540
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:57,969
in like it'll take some more years till

541
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,500
our parents can use it but for now I

542
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,870
hope there will be another release this

543
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:05,320
year and the net last release is from

544
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:07,809
2014 so please do not use that one but

545
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,530
clone the gill net org slash kit if you

546
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:13,720
want to try it out all the release

547
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,280
stopping candidates already fixed so

548
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,490
let's cross fingers that they actually

549
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,450
release and then it's really important

550
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:25,840
that we as hackers as technologists as

551
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,010
geeks and nerds are starting to test it

552
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,620
to use it to

553
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:33,400
be a node in the GU net to find out

554
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,989
what's broken because it'll be like you

555
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,050
know how it is when they stuff like code

556
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,930
coming from universities so we need to

557
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:43,270
check that out and then maybe rewrite

558
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,340
some re-implement some stuff but all the

559
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:49,750
crypto all the mathematics everything is

560
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:51,129
done and I deeply believe that we won't

561
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,350
solve the problem out there

562
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,600
they broke the internet we need to make

563
00:26:53,350 --> 00:27:00,520
a new one that's the only solution to

564
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:02,649
get out okay

565
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,860
a summary for the concept wrote a

566
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:08,050
journalist ones who said it's the food

567
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,659
at the bottom it is this little hacker

568
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:12,730
inside that decides on the cryptography

569
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,580
chosen to communicate with a message

570
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,410
recipient so users don't have to think

571
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,750
about the crypto anymore they can just

572
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:23,470
use it by default and that's where we

573
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:26,340
would like to be in some years because

574
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:29,020
at the moment we are all I mean I guess

575
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,090
when you are here we are all using

576
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:33,310
crypto and we are deciding every day

577
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:36,310
with every communication partner with

578
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:39,580
every kind of communication again what

579
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:41,350
kind of crypto were using like you're on

580
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,060
the road someone's writing you a jpg

581
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:46,510
message which you cannot read you reply

582
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:51,700
oh sorry I cannot read can you paste it

583
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:53,320
into jabber with OTR no but okay you

584
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,170
don't have to wear I'm mobile

585
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,320
let's rather use a memo or you also have

586
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,940
signal great can you paste it there and

587
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,790
so we're making this decision every day

588
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,170
and with every partner we're doing but

589
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,230
we cannot expect this from the people

590
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:11,020
out there and we don't want to be like I

591
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,720
I mean I've done this I've like everyone

592
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:16,389
who asks me I explain it but being

593
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,160
always the missionary of explaining and

594
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,200
showing and then people are like oh my

595
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:24,070
god this is so complicated how I could

596
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,740
ever go into this so why not just leave

597
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,909
them where they are and put it under

598
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:32,650
like sneak it into their usual

599
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,169
communication behavior that's what we're

600
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,880
trying to do

601
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:39,360
all right so to do this we founded a

602
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,039
company or actually - and a foundation

603
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,770
so the company sells applications and

604
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:47,080
services around it business - business

605
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,179
as well as business to consumer which

606
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,939
hasn't started yet because there isn't

607
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:54,850
barely anything which we can sell but

608
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:57,429
the outlook stuff is already started

609
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,678
like it's already been sold and there is

610
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:03,010
the foundation which is founded to

611
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,399
support free software and to support pep

612
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:08,470
and the code of the application not of

613
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,649
the applications of the adaptors and the

614
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:14,110
engine belongs to the foundation because

615
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:17,229
the company as usual gets money's money

616
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,750
from investors and like government

617
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:23,890
funding from the state of Luxembourg and

618
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:26,350
whatnot but we all know that this might

619
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,029
not work out and that investors might

620
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:30,459
have a different opinion on how things

621
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:33,460
work and then at one point you lost

622
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:36,460
everything so the solution of having the

623
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:41,620
codes being an asset of the foundation

624
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:44,440
only I find pretty nice like the idea

625
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,689
was pretty good to have so whatever

626
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,460
happens to the company the code of the

627
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:53,559
actual engine and the adaptors always

628
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:56,020
stays free yeah and it Swiss and

629
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,549
Luxembourg so the foundation is in Swiss

630
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,279
the company is one in Swiss one in

631
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:02,110
Luxembourg which looks a bit fishy if

632
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:04,390
you only see it on a website but it's

633
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,879
because it's people from Switzerland and

634
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,850
people from Luxembourg that's how it is

635
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:15,309
so we think we're coming from fishy

636
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:17,709
countries sorry about that yeah so we

637
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:20,590
have 14 minutes left that's great so

638
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,960
then we can briefly have a look into the

639
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,260
applications or is there any questions

640
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,260
right now

641
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:50,240
good point so the question was if

642
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,260
everything is automated how do you know

643
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,430
if something's working or not working I

644
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,040
haven't mentioned this I should actually

645
00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:05,240
the following the opportunistic approach

646
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:08,320
of what is it defined some trip to most

647
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,390
of the times yeah yeah

648
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,990
so the opportunistic approach is also

649
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:20,840
defined and in a recent RFC and 7400

650
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:25,280
something I can look it up and which is

651
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:27,800
an approach which lots of the recent

652
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:31,610
crypto stuff is following same that the

653
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,430
signal and I think it is even some

654
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:39,110
people from the signal crowd who started

655
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:43,460
this RFC so it says yeah try to have as

656
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:46,280
much as crypto as possible but in case

657
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:50,660
of it doesn't work out send out an

658
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:53,180
encrypted so that's a good point because

659
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,910
that's a pretty important the only

660
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,520
indicator you have then is that it shows

661
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,800
you oh this is now unencrypted but it

662
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,110
will not prevent and that's the idea of

663
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,600
opportunistic trip tour of the whole

664
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,300
approach to get it out to the masses

665
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,149
we cannot hassle them with questions oh

666
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:13,430
this now failed that one didn't work and

667
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,380
what to do next and all it will only

668
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:20,720
give a message oh this will be now sent

669
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:25,460
out and encrypted done so there is no no

670
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,650
really no real yeah error

671
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:31,790
communication with the user which is

672
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:34,880
part of the concept if you are into into

673
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:41,870
this if you're into the whole security

674
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:46,480
stuff then you don't use PAP thanks for

675
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,479
the question any more question

676
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:14,280
yeah the Christian is Gmail what about

677
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:17,429
Gmail everyone uses Gmail it's yeah a

678
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:21,240
problem but web plugins I was mentioning

679
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:23,820
somewhere in some line that one of the

680
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:28,470
things we're taking on next is to have

681
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:32,059
those browser plugins that can then work

682
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:34,950
with the Gmail and all the other web

683
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:38,670
applications there's already this may

684
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:42,210
develop it's called I had this in India

685
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:44,160
actually that people were asking for

686
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:47,130
this and I was like no no no don't touch

687
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,290
like web technology oh my god and crypto

688
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:53,150
we don't even start but then they were

689
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:55,170
like but I don't have a computer right

690
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,750
how should I know

691
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:00,570
do my emails encrypted so I had to have

692
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:02,190
a look in it and it works you can have

693
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:05,040
it on a stick you have your keys on a

694
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,900
stick you have it like a two-goal thing

695
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,540
on a stick so when you go into an

696
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,580
internet cafe you plug it in and then

697
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,090
you can use your keys and you can

698
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,429
decrypt your emails in the web interface

699
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,840
I don't know how it actually works I

700
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:21,000
guess there will be somewhat of an

701
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,760
application on top so it will not be

702
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,580
your Gmail window anymore

703
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,050
but yeah like we're all like okay let's

704
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,719
take on the gloves and look into this

705
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:34,050
web let's see if that happens maybe

706
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:38,040
we get like the problem of that also is

707
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:39,690
gonna be sold solved but yeah thanks for

708
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,719
the question web plugins is very

709
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:44,909
important to get the people but when

710
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,040
they are using now their mobile devices

711
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:51,780
they actually start using image lions

712
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,668
again without even recognizing it any

713
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:58,100
more question at this point or shall I

714
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:58,100
show a bit of the apps

715
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:06,310
all right so this slightly already had

716
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:11,810
that's the current implementation and

717
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:13,759
what we have is this Android canine fork

718
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,609
it's ready to use you can get it from

719
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:20,060
Play Store and from EFT right in Play

720
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:21,950
Store it might be costing something in

721
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:27,950
the future and after itit will always be

722
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:30,140
free and then there is the Windows thing

723
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:32,540
for Outlook which is ready to use that's

724
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,210
in the pet shop you can click that on

725
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,250
pretty easy privacy calm but for sure

726
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,200
you can contact us for testing license

727
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,720
just mention that you heard this on this

728
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,348
conference and we're very happy to give

729
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,390
you a testing license then there is this

730
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:49,599
Thunderbird enik mail which comes down

731
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:53,270
with the next release of anak mail and

732
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,270
the old mode still stays available yeah

733
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:57,859
yeah yeah don't worry

734
00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:00,650
which we are actually really excited

735
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:03,680
because as I mentioned at crypto parties

736
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:05,630
usually you had to do two hours for GPG

737
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,509
and now it's gonna be like install the

738
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:12,710
tor browser done and now the demos oh

739
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:17,450
they are had another christian slides

740
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:20,000
but we go into this that's the actual

741
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:22,250
use case which i show in the demo so we

742
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,830
have to pep users whereas the other one

743
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,330
could also be a non pep user all the

744
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:29,420
other user needs to do is to actually

745
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:31,880
attach the email attached the key on the

746
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:35,990
email but let's stay with two PAP users

747
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,570
they're installing PAP and then LS no

748
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,700
that's Bob Bob writes an email to Alice

749
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:44,839
which is unencrypted now so it's gray

750
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:48,529
then Alice replies and this one is

751
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:50,869
already encrypted how does that work pep

752
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:54,020
generates the key in this moment already

753
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:57,589
for both of them and in this moment pep

754
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:01,480
attaches the public key automatically it

755
00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:04,869
will not even be visible and then Ellis

756
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:12,030
just hits the reply button and also

757
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:14,220
attaches here her private key public you

758
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:17,100
so that means this communication is

759
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,439
already encrypted at this point they

760
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:23,339
couldn't continue forever if they like

761
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,780
as I said before the like we do in ultra

762
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,480
so often we don't verify the

763
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:30,330
fingerprints we just continue talking so

764
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:34,860
in this mode you already communicate

765
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:37,560
encrypted but you should really make

766
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:40,110
this verification with the trust words

767
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,290
so you call each other you say correct

768
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:45,780
horse battery stable you say yes

769
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:50,190
handshake and then you're in the green

770
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:53,580
mode which is encrypted secure and

771
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:56,310
verified there's another slide which

772
00:37:53,580 --> 00:38:00,360
explains this you can also see the ample

773
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:02,880
semantics so if your pep shows read then

774
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,950
it's like the alarm then some

775
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,400
fingerprints didn't work out or

776
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,669
something

777
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,370
so the first email is unencrypted the

778
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:17,040
first reply is encrypted but not

779
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:19,980
verified and then the trust words can be

780
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,500
exchanged on a phone line or whatever

781
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,060
other communication channel is there and

782
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:29,850
then you're secure and trusted in the

783
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:35,810
communication forever as long as you

784
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:39,900
have this installation so in Android you

785
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:42,000
install that's installed you have this

786
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,850
welcome screen after the fresh install

787
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,340
you set up the new account and now the

788
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,830
keys will be generated automatically for

789
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:53,760
importing existing key at the moment

790
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:56,490
there is a pretty stupid work around but

791
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,010
the peps sync the surf does function

792
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:03,450
that's why we didn't implement it at all

793
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:06,360
in the first version you set up the

794
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:08,669
account will choose IMAP I guess that's

795
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,890
what most of the people use so you put

796
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:14,550
in your IMAP server settings SMTP server

797
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:17,370
settings you give the account a name and

798
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,740
now you write an email so that's the

799
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:22,440
first email the compose few of the gray

800
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,330
mount unencrypted plaintext but the key

801
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,960
will be at

802
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:29,450
attached so the next reply with the

803
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,140
attach key is then the yellow mode you

804
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:37,009
now click because you want to verify you

805
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:41,509
click pep in the upper corner and you

806
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:43,310
get the question like you get asked to

807
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:46,460
make the handshake so you say yes

808
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:50,900
handshake and now the trust words are

809
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:55,090
shown so you can start reading them out

810
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:57,290
on the on the phone but you might your

811
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,850
communication partner might be speaking

812
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,230
a different language or having a

813
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,880
different language installed on your

814
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,740
phone so you can change the language I

815
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:09,950
think meanwhile it's even more I

816
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,779
actually have haven't checked if there

817
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:16,850
is a Croatian like so co-creation

818
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:19,250
already there but we having a look so

819
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:21,410
you choose a language so now we've

820
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,820
chosen Spanish so now you have Spanish

821
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:29,240
words and maybe your so now we're back

822
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:32,180
at the menu maybe your partner isn't

823
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:34,040
using Pat but using any other GPG

824
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,140
implementation that means you want to

825
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,450
switch back to the GPG fingerprints and

826
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:41,629
read those out loud so you can also have

827
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:44,960
kept those and then you say confirm and

828
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:47,780
now you're in a secure and trusted mode

829
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,060
in the green mode now you can write

830
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:53,600
emails in the green mode as much as you

831
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:55,970
want but you can also now disabled so

832
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,250
again oh my god I lost my device and

833
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,970
whatever happened I'm in China and it's

834
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:03,440
not going through

835
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:09,770
so please disable protection then you're

836
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:12,410
again in the grey mode and the yeah kind

837
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:16,610
of reply back so that's also working at

838
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:20,899
any time you want to yeah that's all I

839
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:26,540
have here for Android and the next is

840
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:30,340
the outlook that's Windows 7 to 10 all

841
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:34,430
service packs and you need the outlook

842
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:36,290
yeah like a recent outlook you start the

843
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,890
installation you accept the license

844
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,840
agreement

845
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:42,740
as you do on Windows all the time you

846
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:46,330
give we had promised permissions because

847
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:51,350
it's an unknown source then it installs

848
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:53,450
installation completes it maybe if you

849
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,819
have an older version of GPG for vin

850
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:59,029
already installed then there is this

851
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:02,210
thing coming up and asking you if you

852
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:05,630
want to overwrite the current

853
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:07,160
installation or not or whatever so but

854
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:10,280
if you already have a GPG for win

855
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,710
instantly installed then you know what

856
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,710
this means and if not this doesn't even

857
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:18,800
show up and that's all from the

858
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,390
installation if you want to do it like

859
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,280
in a corporate environment you can also

860
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:25,900
do a silent and attendant installation

861
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,220
with that command and then you're done

862
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,200
one of our colleagues by the way tried

863
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,669
it out once with some email clients so

864
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,609
we are much much faster in the

865
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:37,100
installation as any other GPG solution

866
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:40,250
out there I have two and a half minutes

867
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:42,080
left but that should just be fine so

868
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,500
here again you have the unsecure grey

869
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:48,970
mode now you're going into the secure

870
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:52,340
mode with the next reply then you

871
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:54,560
confirm the trust words where you can

872
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,170
again choose the language and choose to

873
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,840
have PGP and then you're in the green

874
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:03,110
mode and you can write you can also

875
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:08,180
reconfirm the trust words and you can

876
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:11,360
also disable the protection as we had

877
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:15,140
before now it's disabled you see it

878
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:17,690
always on the bottom and on top and you

879
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,970
can still attach your key and this is

880
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:22,580
again this real life pick I had this is

881
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,830
actually when the colleague who was

882
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,270
implementing it was in the testing it

883
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,730
was working for the first time with the

884
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,080
key sink this was quite a big thing it's

885
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,900
a bad picture I know but there's

886
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,910
something behind that and one happens

887
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,460
more minutes for questions or you just

888
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:40,850
go and grab stickers which are here and

889
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:43,300
I I think I can place them at the

890
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,650
entrance where you get your this thing

891
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,990
so they'll be there for today in

892
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,470
tomorrow yeah that's it

893
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,470
thank you
