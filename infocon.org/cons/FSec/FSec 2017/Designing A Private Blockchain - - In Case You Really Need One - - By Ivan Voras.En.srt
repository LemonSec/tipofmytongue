1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:13,379
so this is the second year I've been

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,240
presenting on blockchains and such stuff

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,310
I mean the last time was actually not

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,150
last year but the year before and

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,948
believe it or not I presented about

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:30,710
dogecoin so does anybody here know what

7
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:35,280
George or dog or doggie coin is yeah

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:38,460
yeah okay so I'll touch a bit on this

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,719
topic later okay

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:46,410
block chains have been a hype for some

11
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,620
time now I mean at least in the last six

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,319
months but you know even before that and

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,718
a common problem my encounter with

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,109
speaking with people is nobody's really

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,859
sure

16
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:02,699
outside of really small technical teams

17
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:05,670
what block chains are okay so just to

18
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:09,179
get an idea did you raise your hand if

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,240
you think you know or if you know what

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,520
block chains actually are so how is this

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,800
audience on this topic so raise your

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,020
hand if you know what Bach Jean

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,780
technically really is okay so at most

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,100
10% of people and this is a pretty

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,050
technical audience and a 10% of really

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,089
technical audience speaking about the

27
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,670
technology which has been hyped for you

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,220
know everywhere and you know every

29
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,400
single technical magazine or or a blog

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,200
or 401 or whatever is a pretty small

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,759
number okay

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:55,189
so blockchain is the database where

33
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:59,149
Bitcoin stores yet its coins I usually

34
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:02,148
use this metaphor so a blockchain is a

35
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:05,509
type of database okay so the name

36
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:07,959
blockchain is on the similar level as

37
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:12,800
the name for example an SQL database

38
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:16,130
right our Bitcoin is an implementation

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,989
of a blockchain and a similar

40
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:24,530
implementation may be MySQL or Oracle or

41
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:27,170
PostgreSQL or whatever so blockchain is

42
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,420
a type of database Bitcoin implements

43
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:36,470
because it is an implementation of a

44
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:38,929
blockchain right makes sense okay the

45
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,940
major property of block chains is that

46
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:47,930
data is grouped into blocks in case of

47
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:50,359
bitcoins the blocks are transactions and

48
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,940
the blocks are structured in this way in

49
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:56,989
this way that every new block basically

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,600
signs geographically the block before it

51
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:02,570
and the block before it signs the one

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,150
before it and the lockbox before it and

53
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,730
Santa and you know back to the beginning

54
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,579
of time literally the Genesis so the

55
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:14,619
idea is that if you have such a

56
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:17,090
structure its main property is that

57
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,920
demographically speaking is that if

58
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:24,260
somebody changes a block in history I

59
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,780
don't know five years ago or ten years

60
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,358
ago over terror this change is

61
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,269
automatically detected and rejected by

62
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,819
the network so here this really really

63
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:40,120
neat property the data is practically

64
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:40,119
immutable throughout the history okay

65
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,569
the process of creating new blocks and

66
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,869
this will be important later is called

67
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:53,958
mining okay so every all those talks

68
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:58,700
about mining blocks about Bitcoin miners

69
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:01,040
about aetherium mining blocks and

70
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,839
everything else is about the creation of

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,310
new blocks now what this book contains

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:13,099
is a completely different matter and

73
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:15,319
this is another important topic if you

74
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:20,019
talk about block changing tip the

75
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:23,300
currency the blockchain is the database

76
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,669
where the transactions are stored but it

77
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,590
can store something else you'll see

78
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,389
later

79
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,219
cryptocurrency is about the projections

80
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:35,000
which are stored into the in this

81
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,910
database so on one level we have some

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,720
rules some algorithms how blocks are

83
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:43,910
created and how blocks are changed on

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,930
another level we have rules which

85
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:50,120
transactions are well it okay so

86
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:54,220
transactions or cryptocurrencies are an

87
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:59,449
overlay over the blockchain structure

88
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:01,909
okay so we establish some rules we

89
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,860
establish how data is stored into blocks

90
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:06,919
we established that these blocks are

91
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,830
chained okay and then on top of these

92
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:13,760
rules we establish the rules which

93
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:18,349
transactions are well it and these forms

94
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:21,409
are cryptocurrency on another level the

95
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:23,539
next level we can establish that these

96
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:26,570
transactions carry some pieces of code

97
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:29,949
like computer code like program

98
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,300
languages like such stuff and these are

99
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:35,870
overlaid on top of the transactional

100
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:40,150
transaction rules transactional rules so

101
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:43,000
this is a layer above the next layer and

102
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:46,489
then we can say that we have for example

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,919
token coins which are not give the

104
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,529
currencies in themselves but which rely

105
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,750
on for example aterial and these are

106
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:56,719
again

107
00:05:52,750 --> 00:06:00,320
above it so a layabout so tokens are

108
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,340
layered on top of a map contracts smart

109
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,229
contracts are layered on top of

110
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,630
transactions and transactions are

111
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,370
layered on top of block chains and each

112
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,650
of these layers you can think of it like

113
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,919
Network layers if somebody here is a

114
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:16,130
network person and also out I had no cos

115
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:20,240
I layers and stuff each of these layers

116
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:22,490
here with its own rules which constitute

117
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,940
what goes into it and how the data is

118
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:32,510
processed on this layer today's topic is

119
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:34,520
the blockchain okay so I mentioned

120
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:39,080
Bitcoin I mentioned a theorem I

121
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:43,159
mentioned dogcoin and there's probably

122
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,240
right now thousands of alt coins or you

123
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:51,320
know pletely correctly called coins

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,330
because you know once Bitcoin is open

125
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,280
sourced then everybody wants to fork

126
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,510
Bitcoin because between E is successful

127
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,500
so you know everybody wants to get

128
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:03,289
richer whatever and folks its own I

129
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:07,280
think that you know at least 95 percent

130
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:09,169
of old coins alternative coins are made

131
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,030
by forking Bitcoin code and just

132
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:17,799
changing a few constants of your

133
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:20,419
algorithms and such stuff and you know

134
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,729
this points to something else this point

135
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:27,799
that the hype is working and it's

136
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:29,780
obvious the hype is working there's so

137
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,310
much hype about cryptocurrencies there's

138
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,580
so much hype about Bitcoin blockchain

139
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,900
that you know people really are

140
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,680
constantly trying to find a new ways to

141
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:42,469
use them and you know in most cases this

142
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,210
use thing thing means you know to get

143
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:50,240
rich from it but you know there's

144
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:53,299
nothing and we cannot really talk about

145
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,270
Bitcoin especially Bitcoin without

146
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,990
addressing the problems in how blocks

147
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:03,349
are mined by using the proof-of-work

148
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:06,129
algorithm or proof of work semantics did

149
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:08,930
you know that every single transaction

150
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:12,530
you create and put out into the bid for

151
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:18,379
Bitcoin network basically uses as much

152
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:22,099
energy electrical energy as 1.6 American

153
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:23,990
homes in a single day so each time you

154
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:26,240
create a new transaction in Bitcoin

155
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,240
you are basically spending you know

156
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,430
enough energy to power 126 American

157
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:36,789
homes and American homes all bigger than

158
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:39,680
creation right so there's this problem I

159
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:43,218
participated in a facebook argument

160
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,560
argument a few weeks ago where a person

161
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,560
said okay so yeah we are spending

162
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,719
enormous amounts of energy to secure the

163
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,268
network we are spending enormous amount

164
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,850
of energy for this proof-of-work

165
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:59,540
algorithms and because we are spending

166
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,970
and it means that no the algorithms do

167
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,829
some useful work for us and this route

168
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,490
is visible in you know having a

169
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:10,310
realistic pure blockchain but

170
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,459
unfortunately all the major

171
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:16,099
cryptographic cryptocurrencies together

172
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:19,069
have as much transactional bandwidth in

173
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,310
the terms of transactions per second as

174
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:26,029
Croatia so we are spending an enormous

175
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,800
amount of energy and more enormous

176
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:31,820
amount of money which is related to this

177
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:35,839
energy simply to create a digital

178
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,880
economy which is nothing which is less

179
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:44,290
which has less transactions per second

180
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:44,290
than in Croatia right it's a bit insane

181
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:53,029
okay so we'll leave the solution of that

182
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,240
particular problem to future generations

183
00:09:53,029 --> 00:10:02,209
and hope that they will be merciful for

184
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:05,690
us and such stuff so back to basics what

185
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:07,430
are blockchain is good for and depending

186
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:12,450
on who you ask you get various answers

187
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:17,339
like everything like curing the world

188
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:20,610
hunger bringing peace to Middle East you

189
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:23,670
know promoting love among people's and

190
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,740
such stuff and you know if you if you

191
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,490
look at a typical article about

192
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,520
blockchains

193
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,980
in a typical you know mainstream

194
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:35,670
magazine you will see that the

195
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:40,110
blockchain is you know like heavenly

196
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,640
gift to people or something but the

197
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,610
blockchain is basically a database it's

198
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,490
a very very specific database it's you

199
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,380
know it's append only the structure of

200
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,780
common blockchains it doesn't have to be

201
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,640
this way but most common ones are done

202
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,760
this way the structure of blockchain is

203
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,270
such that it is an append-only database

204
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,920
new data is appended at the end in new

205
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:07,350
blocks right the new blocks also sign

206
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,089
all the other blocks and such in such

207
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,850
way we have the chain that the concept

208
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:15,240
of a chain but it really is an

209
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:18,780
append-only database it is database

210
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,180
which is intended to be distributed you

211
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:25,230
know across the internet so across the

212
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:28,890
globe across the planet you can have by

213
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:31,080
using this type of database this block

214
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,870
chain you can have a data distribution

215
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,370
mechanism which basically spends the

216
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:40,080
entire globe if you insert the data into

217
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:44,730
a blockchain educate a new transaction

218
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:48,510
this transaction will all things being

219
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,790
ideal travel the world for Bitcoin in

220
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,890
approximately 10 minutes so your

221
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:57,390
transaction will be visible across the

222
00:11:52,890 --> 00:12:01,500
world in ten minutes it's useful

223
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:05,970
property it also limits the useful speed

224
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:09,240
of such transactions block chains as

225
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:13,680
currently implemented are mostly created

226
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,930
to be read mostly write very very

227
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,420
occasionally this is a great data

228
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,089
distribution mechanism but the need to

229
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,500
have a single ledger in case of Bitcoin

230
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,080
in case of all mainstream

231
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,840
cryptocurrencies means that all those

232
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,700
data from

233
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,100
into a single block chain it is

234
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,630
serialized there is no parallel

235
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,990
computation on this level on the level

236
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:41,640
of blockchain everything goes

237
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:45,230
sequentially in it but on the other

238
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,970
thing on the other point of view

239
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,740
blockchain is what it is or at least

240
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,630
Bitcoin blockchain and similar

241
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,440
cryptocurrency block chains is what it

242
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,840
is because it is intended to be a medium

243
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,450
of communication in this case about

244
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:04,260
financial data between parties which do

245
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:07,710
not trust each other it is created with

246
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,110
HIPAA very key algorithms precisely in

247
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:14,460
this way and precisely because it

248
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:16,220
enables parties which basically have no

249
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,440
reason to trust each other

250
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,870
that suspect each other of you know

251
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,700
cheating lying trying to manipulate data

252
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:29,730
right and in it enables those parties to

253
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,190
hear an agreement to have an agreement

254
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,320
about you know how data will be

255
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,290
structured to have an agreement or how

256
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,050
they will communicate among themselves

257
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:43,500
on more or less standard or more or less

258
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:45,589
settled settled accounts and this is the

259
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,470
importance of blockchain as it is and

260
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:58,290
this is this is how blockchain could be

261
00:13:49,470 --> 00:14:01,650
used outside cryptocurrencies so all

262
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:04,620
cryptocurrencies today are public block

263
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:07,500
chains everyone can download an

264
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,200
application a Bitcoin wallet and a

265
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,510
Tyrian wallet whatever anyone can run

266
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,580
those wallets everyone can download the

267
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:18,600
entire blockchain everyone can create

268
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:21,990
new transactions and even everyone can

269
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,300
mine and when I say everyone this is

270
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,220
almost statistically true because

271
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,109
statistically speaking everyone on the

272
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:34,300
earth lives in China

273
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:38,589
no takers okay major block Bitcoin

274
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:40,870
mining operations are in China okay

275
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,000
and each time China does something

276
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,790
strange like issue some kind of

277
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,290
proclamation about cryptocurrencies

278
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:51,040
issues some kind of new law issues a

279
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:53,829
kinda new anything really which deals

280
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,910
with keep the currencies and especially

281
00:14:53,829 --> 00:15:00,310
bit canary Tyrael the value of Bitcoin a

282
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:05,199
materials theorem either goes ups or

283
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:10,199
gota goes down right so if we could say

284
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:13,480
that I know certain people have

285
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,209
envisioned Bitcoin to be a tool for

286
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,829
anarchism right they have envisioned

287
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:23,560
Bitcoin to be the solution to the

288
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:24,969
problem of evil banks and the idea was

289
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,760
to use a Bitcoin to use crypto

290
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:32,350
currencies in a way which will basically

291
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,910
fight the system I mean I know that in

292
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,180
this audience there are quite a few

293
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:40,290
people who would really like such such a

294
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:45,130
world or or you know such an agenda but

295
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:49,089
in reality we have replaced in Bitcoin

296
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:56,790
we have replaced banks with unknown

297
00:15:49,089 --> 00:16:02,399
Chinese wealthy millionaires or you know

298
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:07,779
unknown persons of huge economic impact

299
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,550
there are stories about certain mining

300
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:13,390
operations certain data centers been

301
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:16,660
being built in China and near those data

302
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:19,829
centers entire new power plants entirely

303
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:25,600
new power generators which power only

304
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:27,459
blockchain mining operations right so if

305
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,380
you have an enormous amount of money and

306
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,569
you have an enormous amount of political

307
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,699
influence in China you build a data

308
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:37,949
center for mining Bitcoin and you build

309
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:37,949
a power plant next to it to power it

310
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,080
almost all

311
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:52,850
power electrical power in China comes

312
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:56,030
from coal from burning coal and that's

313
00:16:52,850 --> 00:17:03,110
another thing okay

314
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:04,609
so if you hear Bitcoin it's a public

315
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,270
blockchain so everyone can download it

316
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,109
everyone who uses

317
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:11,089
everyone can mine it if you are Chinaman

318
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:12,109
if you hear a private blockchain that

319
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,869
means do you have some kind of

320
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:17,119
extinctions on these operations so

321
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:19,250
either only certain people can download

322
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,500
it only certain people can access the

323
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,319
blockchain or only certain people can

324
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,660
mine it or create a new block create new

325
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,300
blocks on it or some other kind of

326
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,360
restrictions but compared to a public

327
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:37,030
blockchain you know it's not as free

328
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,030
it's not as public as a paper blockchain

329
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:46,850
so to demonstrate this I will go through

330
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:50,659
a blockchain I made from scratch and I'm

331
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:54,439
Nate I named it Daisy because I was sort

332
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:57,470
of drunk today and sort of get got the

333
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:01,250
idea of daisy chain which may or may not

334
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:05,750
be applicable to this one and this is

335
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:07,880
mostly a learning project and I hope you

336
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,380
know obviously I hope that I will

337
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,600
actually use it somewhere you know I

338
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,450
hope that you know some great Chinamen

339
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,919
you know comes in contacts me but you

340
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:22,520
see and it's open source it's on this

341
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,780
URL here and I will go through it to

342
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:30,500
show you how it structures are

343
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:33,860
structured and what it does so this

344
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,370
block chain has blocks which are SQLite

345
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,530
databases SQLite is a small embedded

346
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,580
database engine which uses ordinary

347
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:45,710
files a single file for each database so

348
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,100
you can basically create a random

349
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:53,090
application and you can use

350
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,070
through SQLite a single file as your

351
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,299
database so you don't have to connect to

352
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,689
Oracle you don't have to connect to

353
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:00,019
MySQL you don't have to correct - I

354
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,659
don't know

355
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:04,639
MongoDB especially or something else you

356
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:07,490
have a single file which represents all

357
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:10,658
your data which calls all your data this

358
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:13,070
includes SQL indexes table structures

359
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:17,889
really everything which is needed by

360
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:20,178
database so books on SQLite databases

361
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:23,449
it's a private blockchain in the sense

362
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:25,279
that only certain people can add data to

363
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,730
this blockchain only certain people can

364
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,590
create in mind new blocks right so what

365
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,299
does it mean doesn't mean it's not

366
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,860
really like a Bitcoin stuff it's not

367
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:36,049
really intended to be used as a

368
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,570
cryptocurrency although it can be but

369
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:44,090
it's intended to be used for data

370
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:46,490
distribution and the next criteria is

371
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:48,289
the set of special nodes that those

372
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,600
nodes which get which can create new

373
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:54,470
blocks is dependant to be dynamic to

374
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:57,709
grow and what is the what are the

375
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:01,039
constant basis of this is okay so now

376
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:04,539
you can hear a blockchain and use SQL to

377
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,190
insert and query data in this book chain

378
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:11,179
you can have new new blocks which

379
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,740
contain arbitrary data there are some of

380
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,450
course there's some system tables

381
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,539
involved which would you do not touch

382
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,120
but otherwise you can get ordinary SQL

383
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:22,279
tables you can insert data to it you

384
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,750
think issue queries along the whole

385
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:29,539
blockchain and get results from it and

386
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:31,370
this is a pretty useful feature you can

387
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:37,009
basically store whatever you can store

388
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:39,739
in SQLite and this is vital to data ok

389
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:44,590
the private part is implemented like

390
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:47,559
this so there's a set of public keys

391
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:50,360
there's a set of key pairs let's say

392
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:54,470
which each is allowed to create new

393
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:57,260
blocks so new blocks in dayz are created

394
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:01,050
in this way somebody creates an SQLite

395
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:04,750
database it fills it up with data

396
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:07,360
okay it's passes it to a special utility

397
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,730
which creates some special tables in

398
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,760
this database and then signs

399
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:15,490
cryptographically signs these database

400
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,740
with the private key of its creator and

401
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,730
then it sends it into the peer-to-peer

402
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:24,130
network to be attached to the blockchain

403
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:27,700
okay this means that only certain people

404
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:31,780
can create new blocks only certain

405
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:35,110
people can can grow the blockchain but

406
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,720
to be interesting really I made it that

407
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:40,389
this set of keys

408
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,890
this set of signatories which can create

409
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:48,010
new blocks can grow in a way that

410
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:50,920
existing nodes existing signatories can

411
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:54,610
vote on accepting new ones into their

412
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:57,700
lists so if I don't know if there are

413
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,620
five institutions or nodes or whatever

414
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:04,510
which creates new data five companies

415
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:06,550
which create new data they can vote by

416
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,550
using to graphically assigned

417
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:12,490
transactions they can vote to accept a

418
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:19,240
new one into their list so it's sort of

419
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:22,630
a web of trust faith softer like PGP use

420
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,690
cases for something like this well the

421
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,060
most the most important use case the

422
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:31,300
most the most interesting use case for

423
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:34,810
me is in basically in distributing

424
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:37,840
sensor data so imagine a large network

425
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:40,659
of sensors which is organized as around

426
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,870
certain hubs and this is a common

427
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:47,640
organization you have a hub which you

428
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:50,229
know which serves for I know hundreds of

429
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,760
individual sensors and all those sensors

430
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:57,990
report data to this main hub ok this hub

431
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:01,060
can collect the data into blocks and

432
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,430
then sign those blocks and add it to the

433
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,340
block chain in this way you can for

434
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:09,280
example get historical data or sensors

435
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,260
through time which are signed you know

436
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,370
which are distributed in the blockchain

437
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,160
way

438
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,080
but this this analogy this this metaphor

439
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,320
obviously applies to other things for

440
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,830
example imagine if if legislature if

441
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,840
laws are distributed in this way you

442
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,629
have a blockchain and every time a new

443
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,590
law is signed until into effect it is

444
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:36,250
signed and added to the blockchain of

445
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:39,459
laws for example so I think it's it's an

446
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,870
interesting thing to do a couple of

447
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,780
months ago I was in a meeting and

448
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,489
another idea popped into my mind you

449
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,520
know of those barcodes you see

450
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:51,340
everywhere in in shops in products you

451
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,220
buy for example are a bottle of beer or

452
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,750
something and you have this barcode

453
00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:00,540
attached to it and this part will get

454
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:02,800
scanned when you pay for it right so

455
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,809
there's a global organization which

456
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,059
handles out which hands out these

457
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:10,990
barcodes there are numbers which

458
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:13,330
uniquely identify a product and there's

459
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:17,110
another piece of legislature which says

460
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:19,510
that every food product must carry a

461
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,219
list of ingredients their nutritional

462
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:24,370
effects you know so this is the table of

463
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:29,700
nutritional effects on every chocolate

464
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:32,919
or beer or or whatever else you have so

465
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,500
would it be great if you had a single

466
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,230
application on your phone and you can

467
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,970
scan this barcode of whatever and you

468
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,929
can get the list of nutritional facts on

469
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:46,900
your phone directly from the network

470
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:50,020
right and this is a use case which could

471
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:55,720
be applied with multiple otherwise

472
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:58,720
hostile or competitive companies you can

473
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,670
have I don't know coca-cola a pending

474
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,160
data to the blockchain about their

475
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,900
products you can have Pepsi appending

476
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,080
data to the blockchain for their

477
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,170
products and this blockchain is publicly

478
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,139
distributed you know but if you get a

479
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,240
block which is created or signed by the

480
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,340
coca-cola company or or Pepsi company

481
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,190
you know it's well it you know the data

482
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,280
in it is valid so this is kind of a

483
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,760
useful thing

484
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:29,370
a tedium sort of experiments it's an

485
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,830
experimental branch of aetherium which

486
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:35,310
does sort of something like this they

487
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:37,169
have the proof of authority thing and it

488
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,419
also goes into in the direction that

489
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,340
only certain nodes can create new blocks

490
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,760
so this is something we should probably

491
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:49,110
very useful and talked about in the

492
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:54,240
future okay so this has been a lot of

493
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:57,379
information I think I hope - I hope to

494
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,600
present a few key points on all this so

495
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:04,170
the first one is block chains do not

496
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:07,350
need to be about cryptocurrencies the

497
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:10,910
term block chain is more like a database

498
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:15,389
you can store in it practically whatever

499
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:17,340
the second tile type thing is that you

500
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,360
know the experimental block chain I've

501
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,620
created

502
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,110
uses SQLite databases so you can insert

503
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:30,780
SQL SQL data you can query the data in

504
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:34,439
SQLite way and you know that it's time

505
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:38,040
to abandon or not abandon to expand the

506
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,080
idea of block chains for us not only for

507
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,270
currencies not only for financial data

508
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,750
but maybe it you know cooperation

509
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,820
between companies or you know business

510
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,480
to government or government to business

511
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:55,980
actually or something like this in the

512
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:59,850
end all of those things I mentioned can

513
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:02,190
be googled I mean please you know search

514
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,620
on it if somebody tells you that block

515
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,300
chains can or cannot do something all of

516
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,580
this is public information all of this

517
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:12,300
is everywhere on the internet you just

518
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:15,480
need to Google SEO and if you want some

519
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:18,930
other information on block chains or you

520
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:24,510
know Daisy or something like this feel

521
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:26,070
free to contact me obviously I think we

522
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,250
have three minutes left through

523
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:34,509
questions and thank you very much

524
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,509
[Applause]

525
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:30,389
yeah okay so sacred so secretary

526
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,650
technology which has been recently very

527
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:35,260
publicly exposed or very publicly

528
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,150
debated in the Bitcoin community I mean

529
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,730
practically nobody else knows about it

530
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:42,600
except Bitcoin enthusiasts the idea is

531
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:46,840
to increase the transaction rate of

532
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:51,040
Bitcoin so a few slides ago I hear this

533
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:53,020
data bit between three transactions per

534
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,290
second and seven three sections per

535
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:59,620
seconds at all possible in Bitcoin so

536
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:01,840
this is nothing this is you know this

537
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,969
low transaction rate makes it unusable

538
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,860
through any kind of protections not only

539
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,440
micro transactions but any kind of

540
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,459
nationalizations in real world

541
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,090
okay so sacred is one of the

542
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:18,900
technologies which was created mainly to

543
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:26,459
to expand this transaction rate okay so

544
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:29,230
save it in this in this frame in this

545
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,960
context he has increased the number of

546
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:35,520
transactions from

547
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:41,300
and no three to seven to about times war

548
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:44,700
not so 12 to 7 times for 28 right so

549
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,700
even with sacred you have increased the

550
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,280
capacity of between two maximum of 28

551
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,400
transactions per second this is nothing

552
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,300
this is still hugely inadequate to beat

553
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:59,220
forbidden to become a global financial

554
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,590
network or carrier so you could also

555
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,540
hear some other additions it changes the

556
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,270
way transactions are recorded in the

557
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:09,690
blockchain I think the other editions

558
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:12,629
are mostly okay so I don't see any

559
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,700
security problems with it but sacred

560
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:18,420
itself is not radical enough

561
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,120
I support sacred because it's better

562
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:24,360
than what we had before but sacred is

563
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,860
not radical enough it needs to eat it

564
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,149
need to be much more radical so

565
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:31,350
lightning idea I think should go on it

566
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:35,070
should be implemented as soon as

567
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,240
possible okay or something like it but

568
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,429
something which will increase the

569
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,560
capacity of the Bitcoin network to

570
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:45,600
actually be useful as a financial

571
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:49,590
transaction mechanism globally okay

572
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,179
the other idea is what will some states

573
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,770
or what are some countries do with the

574
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:58,080
idea of cryptocurrencies and block

575
00:30:52,770 --> 00:31:00,120
chains as I mentioned every time China

576
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,679
mentions Bitcoin or aetherium or

577
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,449
something the value of Bitcoin goes up

578
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,580
or down you know this is completely

579
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,470
different thing but the idea of using

580
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,480
block chains for this distributed

581
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:12,770
governmental for distribution of

582
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,230
governmental data so for distribution of

583
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,760
certificates driver's licenses such type

584
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:21,210
of information which need to be accessed

585
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,400
by you know everyone I think is actually

586
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:26,310
a good idea I think this is something

587
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,200
which needs to be done I've not heard of

588
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,929
anyone actually implementing such things

589
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,660
so there are talks there are articles

590
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:36,060
which you know announce that this is

591
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:39,570
happening but I don't think anyone has

592
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,790
actually started doing it I mean we

593
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,280
don't know what China is doing and we

594
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:47,010
didn't know what maybe Russia is doing

595
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,899
nothing which is really publicized is

596
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,250
available on this topic and it's a good

597
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:57,050
thing it's a good I think it's a good

598
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:57,050
idea to implement okay

599
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:12,630
excuse me speak louder okay the question

600
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,909
is how to secure the blockchain if you

601
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:19,320
don't have the hairs power of you know

602
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:21,390
the whole of China like this why do you

603
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,030
need proof of work to have a secure

604
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:28,050
blockchain you can have the blocks

605
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:31,080
signed you know the the algorithm which

606
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:33,210
secures blocks does not need to be proof

607
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:39,830
of work it can be ordinary cryptographic

608
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:42,780
signatures so if you have key which is

609
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:45,210
held by your government or materials

610
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:47,310
organization you can verify that this

611
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,940
that the new block in the blockchain is

612
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:53,909
indeed added or created by your

613
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,620
government so proof work is not

614
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,720
necessary this is this is that this is

615
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,780
one of the main ideas here proof of work

616
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,740
is not necessary for crypto currencies

617
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:07,770
and block chains cryptocurrencies are

618
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,050
not required not necessary to have block

619
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:13,430
chains block chains can be used from

620
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:24,600
much much wider purposes than today are

621
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:27,330
used today okay some other questions so

622
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,060
why does proof work exist proof of work

623
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:33,570
exists because parties do not trust each

624
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:36,990
other so the basic the basic thing which

625
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:40,460
is solved by hearing proof of work is to

626
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:43,800
have parties which do not want to use

627
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:48,750
key signing or or signing the data by

628
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,680
you know keys and to use an algorithm

629
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,080
which is so

630
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,630
computationally hard that it is

631
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:59,199
impractical impractical to Forge

632
00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:02,920
so if you if you waste so much energy in

633
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,890
creating a single block in Bitcoin you

634
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,530
will be crazy to waste as much energy to

635
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:12,520
forge it and if you want to forge a

636
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:14,380
block which is I don't know then ten

637
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,540
blocks removed from the current fund so

638
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,450
ten blocks in the past you will need to

639
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,360
forge these blocks this block and nine

640
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:26,980
other blocks you need to you need to

641
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,770
spend ten times as much energy to forge

642
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,530
this part of the blockchain you know if

643
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:36,190
you would if you wanted to so in this

644
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:38,500
way as much you know as much energy is

645
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:42,130
wasted to create for creation of new

646
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:44,770
blocks in Bitcoin the upside of it the

647
00:34:42,130 --> 00:35:18,040
reason for this is that so much harder

648
00:34:44,770 --> 00:35:22,030
is it to forge those blocks okay yes

649
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,590
okay for backing up that's probably the

650
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:27,040
least concern because everybody here

651
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:29,860
would have a copy the problem of the

652
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,900
size of the block chain is general so

653
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,850
it's not something which is unique to

654
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,500
any particular use case either

655
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,960
cryptocurrencies or you know

656
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,890
governmental records or anything else

657
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,440
currently I think the bitcoins

658
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:44,830
blockchain is about hundred gigabytes

659
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,630
something on the order of this right and

660
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:49,029
this means if you want to have you know

661
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,430
the entire block chain on your computer

662
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:53,380
you need the hundred gigabytes of space

663
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:57,009
in ten years you'll probably have I

664
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:59,410
don't know a terabyte whatever

665
00:35:57,009 --> 00:36:02,469
there are a couple of proposed solutions

666
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:04,779
to this one such solution is creating

667
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:07,569
checkpoints so every I don't know every

668
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:09,880
five years we say okay we start we're

669
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:11,349
starting a new blockchain and we're you

670
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,559
know we are collecting all the end

671
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:17,469
results so all the end results for

672
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:19,420
example all the address balances all all

673
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:21,729
the coins belonging to certain addresses

674
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:24,249
we collect them we create a new special

675
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:27,459
block and we create a new block chain

676
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:30,129
from this data on okay so in a way we

677
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:31,839
can reset the blockchain every five

678
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,539
years or something like this this is one

679
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:37,239
solution but in general this is not

680
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:40,209
something which is worked on I mean

681
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:43,630
those are only ideas nobody is actually

682
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:46,689
working on on on such a such a problem I

683
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:49,059
mean it gets worse because if we

684
00:36:46,689 --> 00:36:50,890
increase the rate of transactions being

685
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:53,529
going on in the blockchain

686
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:58,259
we will also increase the size of the

687
00:36:53,529 --> 00:37:00,609
blockchain if you have for example I

688
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:03,130
don't know I have calculated something

689
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:07,808
like a thousand transactions per second

690
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:12,189
you would need I think it was it was on

691
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:13,929
the order of four terabytes a day if you

692
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:15,788
if you put them all in the single

693
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:17,019
blockchain if you put thousand

694
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:19,539
transactions per second in a blockchain

695
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:21,549
I need to verify the data I've

696
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:27,239
calculated a long time ago you would

697
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:29,949
need you know four terabytes daily I

698
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,719
cannot give you an answer because nobody

699
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:33,699
has actually implemented any answer

700
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:36,219
answer to this I think that

701
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:37,719
checkpointing or you know starting new

702
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:40,299
block chains every every couple of years

703
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:42,369
would be the best solution so we don't

704
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:44,559
have any time so if they're you know

705
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:47,859
important and very interesting questions

706
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:53,189
then one otherwise you know let's peek

707
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:53,189
outside okay

708
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:22,359
in the context of Daisy I'm not sure I

709
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:37,299
understand the question so right okay

710
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:38,980
okay yes so the question is how do we

711
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,530
know who created the block in a

712
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,420
blockchain so the general answer in

713
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:48,579
currently implemented blockchain is we

714
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:50,640
don't so the block chains of Bitcoin

715
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:54,490
aetherium and such popular

716
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,150
cryptocurrencies do not do not directly

717
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:59,919
contain any authorship information so

718
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,890
this is not present in the structure so

719
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,069
no in the case of for example Daisy or

720
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:08,500
something like this in particular Daisy

721
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:11,380
it implements a list of keys which are

722
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:15,569
allowed to create new blocks so this

723
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:18,940
list of keys is also not directly

724
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:22,480
related to ownership it doesn't contain

725
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:25,300
ownership data but if this is modified

726
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,250
to use for example certificate authority

727
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,050
certificates which for example guarantee

728
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,900
that a key belongs to a certain

729
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,700
organization then we would solve your

730
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,130
problem of you know pretty much

731
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,879
guaranteeing that a certain block C is

732
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:43,450
signed or created by the certain party

733
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,670
okay so I call this this is an

734
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:47,470
interesting topic I I mean obviously it

735
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:51,700
is an interesting topic and I hope that

736
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:53,529
you learned from me and if you have any

737
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,379
more questions if you can any more ideas

738
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,210
you wish to share let's talk aside thank

739
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,270
you

740
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,270
you

741
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,489
[Applause]
