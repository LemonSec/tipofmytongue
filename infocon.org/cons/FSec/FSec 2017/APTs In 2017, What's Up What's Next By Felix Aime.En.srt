1
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:12,989
hello thank you for being here Abed

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,119
before my talk I would like to do two

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,250
tanks or the stuff for this conference

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:24,540
and to me to have organized that that

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:28,500
event which is a very great event sorry

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,830
so I'm French my English is not best as

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,890
your but it will be okay like I would

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,220
speak as a like five years old child or

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,160
donor train if you want it's okay

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,720
so my talk today will deals yeah with

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,339
targeted attacks so apt stuff like that

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,640
what we have seen during the last year

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:56,760
during the last conference and what we

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:01:00,420
can expect for the the next year's so I

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,819
don't know if all of you know what's

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,590
great and a great team so it's a team

17
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:10,949
dedicated to to do a lot of

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:16,219
investigation related mainly to target

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:20,009
it straight we also have good research

20
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:23,369
regarding reverse engineering industry

21
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,899
our control systems the flag lat and we

22
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:31,408
also investigate on banking threats and

23
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:34,219
some cybercrime stuff and so we have

24
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:39,389
different profile we have like River so

25
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:42,298
we have man is like me that then threat

26
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:47,219
Intel etc so this store will not deal

27
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,439
about like reverse engineering or stuff

28
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:54,089
like that but you will have some source

29
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:57,089
code of malware so I have a one question

30
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:03,060
for you is that since the last seven do

31
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:06,539
you remember everything of of all of the

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,539
event that occurred in the Subspace like

33
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:11,310
wanna cry stuff like that because to do

34
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:15,909
a talk like that it's quite ambitious

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:18,610
and nearly impossible if you see

36
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:21,849
the headline in the news so you want

37
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:27,370
many and many different events from like

38
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:29,230
shemune mirai the microphone leaks stuff

39
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,069
like that you are not busy are you have

40
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,040
wanna cry

41
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:35,470
you have the shadow brokers leaks you

42
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,980
have also boards even stuff like that so

43
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:43,920
it's quite difficult to to to our talk

44
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:51,599
on HD evan and it's quite boring i think

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:54,670
so i will present you stuff that still

46
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,518
still allows an attacker to enter in

47
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,409
network and i will try to insert a few

48
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,079
question like where are the chinese

49
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:04,929
today because you have a lot of prison

50
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:11,200
you had lots of reports on them and

51
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:14,470
today you don't have anything and other

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,349
stuff like that so here is a nice view

53
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,980
on an iceberg like why

54
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:24,760
speaking about security events when you

55
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,349
don't see anything for example you have

56
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,500
the publication at the top of the

57
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:34,358
iceberg is publication in open source so

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,849
i also has marketing stuff you have also

59
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:40,329
great researcher that do a lot of things

60
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:44,578
is that you have previous reports and

61
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:48,099
research groups that share between them

62
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:51,819
IOC and stuff like that and you have at

63
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:54,518
the bottom of the iceberg all you see

64
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,440
that are not shared by victims why they

65
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,949
don't Archer

66
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,699
maybe it's by shame because of the

67
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:06,430
consumers maybe they don't know that the

68
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:10,180
the simple malware on the workstation is

69
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,519
a part of a bigger thing and maybe they

70
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,609
don't know how to share with like their

71
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:21,970
governments or other actor in the same

72
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:27,930
sector so let's back to a business do

73
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:30,419
you remember this name it's all its

74
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,180
or Chinese attackers group not all

75
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:38,370
because you have many names by many

76
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:42,660
vendor but since like 2010 you had many

77
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:47,070
publication and them apt one black vine

78
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,830
stuff like that and today since like the

79
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:54,360
beginning of the year I count like 5

80
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:58,229
blog post on them and one report public

81
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,199
report and a good report from the vio

82
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:05,610
system guide so where are they

83
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:10,320
why we don't see them so there is a lot

84
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:13,169
of speculation regarding that we see a

85
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,120
module decrease of Chinese attacks so

86
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:19,500
and there is a marginal decrease of

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,930
reports so maybe it's the certain 5

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,889
years plan I don't know if you are very

89
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:30,990
familiar with China but each five years

90
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:34,199
they they do like a plan in order to to

91
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:40,190
do strategic orientation so you have you

92
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:42,539
had this plan in 2016 and it just draw

93
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,260
strategic orientation regarding like

94
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:50,039
transport in new wave energy military

95
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:54,630
stuff etc you have also the PLA military

96
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:58,080
reform so it's the military the Chinese

97
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,900
military reform that focused this reform

98
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,070
focused and check many units in the PLA

99
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:08,310
so maybe the unit's in like the IPT one

100
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:13,139
report doesn't exist anymore you are

101
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:15,380
also with some hypothesis the some

102
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,419
agreements of non-aggression with

103
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:23,250
different countries like Russia or USA

104
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:25,979
after the OPM arc and maybe now analysts

105
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,880
can like me I've switched to more like

106
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:33,900
sexy things maybe Russia u.s. stuff like

107
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:37,440
that or maybe they are still attacking

108
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:41,760
or network and we don't see them why we

109
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:45,000
don't see them because we had a lot of

110
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:50,700
public and private reports and our mind

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,910
today is focused on like apt targeted

112
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:57,840
attacks is definitely linked with

113
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:00,750
spearfishing the problem is that most of

114
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,109
the case that I have been able to to

115
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:07,350
work on realize during the last years

116
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:12,000
with like frontal compromised yeah

117
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:16,230
like web shell is a like it's 32 bytes I

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,190
think and this type of web shell is very

119
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:25,200
good because it's stealthy is passive so

120
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:27,240
you have a lot of of of security editors

121
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,060
that say all we have seen a passive

122
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,630
malware very sophisticated but that type

123
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,710
of web shell you can you can put it on

124
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:41,280
any web server inside the entity and it

125
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:44,900
can they in like some Chinese group just

126
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,159
put them and ensure the OPSEC the

127
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,830
operational security with your own

128
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,710
security because what they do is they

129
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:57,419
put it on some web server that they have

130
00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:02,219
SSL so you don't see anything and the

131
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:05,550
implant is still here for many years you

132
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,180
have also some trends like compromised

133
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:12,960
of suppliers the report of beer

134
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,660
regarding crudo / was like that

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,960
so crudo / is one of the campaign's

136
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:24,930
related to the many past guy it's a very

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:27,719
like all Chinese uppity apt and so you

138
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:31,980
have different way to to compromise the

139
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,250
company but passing truth a surprise is

140
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:38,370
very good because you can have directly

141
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:41,549
VPN access you can go with LDP you can

142
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,530
just access to like share points or

143
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:49,500
stuff like that so it's it's quite easy

144
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:52,350
and many of them are not so secure you

145
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,230
have also and it's a

146
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:58,380
it's a very odd trick but when made

147
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,300
fishing with with fishing regarding

148
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:04,320
windmill and not only like Chinese I

149
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,990
don't do all those things like surf I

150
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,120
see group do that a lot

151
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:15,630
it'll all use like to to pass truth a

152
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,839
true VP and stuff like that and try to

153
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,480
grab some information you have trapping

154
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,899
legitimate instil out that we have seen

155
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,839
like quite recently with a shadow pod

156
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:35,430
marwah and many attackers group do that

157
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:38,190
like in 2014 if I remember well you have

158
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:42,029
the Avex guy dragonfly guy that I've

159
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:44,759
done that and so was this spearfishing

160
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:48,899
with like zip attachment stuff like that

161
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:51,240
we don't see anymore like related to

162
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,680
Chinese actor but it still exists

163
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,139
it still exists by many attackers to

164
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,029
that and they do also a lot of other

165
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:05,610
thing and of course inside the network

166
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:09,630
attacker for the dome for people that

167
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,910
don't know how the whole a man or a team

168
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:16,380
penetrate the net world it's really on

169
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:19,050
open-source tools and like Microsoft as

170
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:24,420
a good tools for that like PowerShell

171
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:27,630
RDP etc after that you have many and

172
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,800
many today you have many and many cyber

173
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:35,730
mercenary that are targeting also

174
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,620
private entities and what we have seen

175
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,470
is that there are more and more

176
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,649
difficult to track because like when you

177
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:48,209
have like up is ATT one in front of you

178
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:50,639
or any States backed actor they they

179
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:54,469
really on very easy procedure in the

180
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:57,810
infrastructure in the MAL world they use

181
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:02,040
every time the same code with and it's

182
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:05,420
quite easy to get to end them in network

183
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,980
for cyber mercenaries like a red

184
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,930
it's like red teaming there are three

185
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,160
four and they do the infrastructure

186
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:16,790
malware and your operational compromised

187
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,939
then they don't have any AV procedure so

188
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:22,849
it's very difficult to track them after

189
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:28,730
that they use today a lot of open source

190
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:32,630
tools like you can go on on on google

191
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:36,050
and type like python backdoor and github

192
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:40,700
and you will see all of the projects on

193
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:44,719
like path python by a backdoor and they

194
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:49,250
also really on like partition at

195
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:53,330
infrastructure so you can't take like 1

196
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:59,570
1 c 2 and try to find rest of the

197
00:11:53,330 --> 00:12:02,810
infrastructure it's very difficult but

198
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:05,720
so you have cyber mercenary that can be

199
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:10,069
related to some governments in order to

200
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:14,020
defeat attribution but some other cyber

201
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:21,590
masonry are just looking for you money

202
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:24,590
today we have some trends like some some

203
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:29,090
actors just use botnet to deploy bile

204
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:31,580
and tolerate malware on I value targets

205
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:34,190
it have seen like during the last year

206
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:39,710
with Android X which is a banking Trojan

207
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:42,560
that I've dropped like carbonic on some

208
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,260
high-value targets you have also

209
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,609
targeted run somewhere so today run

210
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:52,880
somewhere like okay we we go and spread

211
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:59,480
the world with we friend somewhere but I

212
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:03,410
think that in in few in few months over

213
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,080
here I think it will be month we will

214
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,900
see once run somewhere that when they

215
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,350
are on a workstation they will decide ok

216
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:16,100
are we linked to one activity directory

217
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:22,140
there is possibilities just to

218
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:24,900
to pivot on the network and try to to to

219
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:29,760
ask for a reason according to what

220
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:32,819
company we have compromised also you

221
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,939
have no school reactor that I've

222
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:39,570
compromised like I don't remember it was

223
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:42,750
with a watering hole against one of the

224
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:47,490
Polish financial institution and they

225
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:52,170
try to compromise like banks counters so

226
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:54,920
cyber criminals and many actors who

227
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,920
deals with money

228
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,420
the fact is today there is no more

229
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:06,030
sophistication gap between likes IBM

230
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:11,550
machinery and most of the

231
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:15,060
state-sponsored attack and what's up so

232
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:17,189
regarding the stone nation-states so you

233
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:21,949
have thousands and thousands of country

234
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:25,290
that have developed cyber capabilities

235
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:27,900
you are you just to to know that you

236
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,630
just have to like look at the ARCIC

237
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,020
teams leaks and see the list of their

238
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,900
consumers is quite impressive and

239
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:40,560
there's cyber as you know optional is no

240
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:47,310
longer dedicated to only cyber espionage

241
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:52,949
but they are do they do some research

242
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:56,339
regarding how to destroy a country we we

243
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:59,910
had some examples just few months before

244
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:02,600
with not pizza and wanna cry but if you

245
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:07,020
look during the time you are also

246
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:12,420
obviously Stuxnet and some attacks like

247
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:16,020
against the Turk a DNS name servers

248
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,979
we've had a DOS attack when Turkey just

249
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:27,140
shut down

250
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:31,070
hatch shut down ocean planner so we will

251
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:35,210
not I think in the next years

252
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:39,110
we will not a race of false flag

253
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:45,440
operation as we have seen like with td5

254
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:50,510
words and different link in order to to

255
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:54,500
direct and disturb like election stuff

256
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:58,220
like that and of course and you will see

257
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:03,590
just after more and more state attacker

258
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:07,250
don't look to develop their own tool but

259
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:10,910
they will rely on open source tools and

260
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:14,540
partial stuff stuff like that so why

261
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:17,719
requiring sophistica codes and expert

262
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:21,680
well the door are still open let's see

263
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,840
this code it's like it's a code so I

264
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,300
think that every season main pentester

265
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,870
in this room we recognize that it's in

266
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,170
PowerShell

267
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:35,210
it's a very little backdoor 28 line of

268
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:39,140
partial with just one aim is to get a

269
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:42,830
payload on a remote server decrypt it

270
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:45,949
and executives like I don't know how

271
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:49,460
many times and restart this backdoor so

272
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:52,310
with that you can do everything they

273
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,480
have some object failure in that because

274
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:59,569
if I don't know if you know that but

275
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:03,589
this HTTP request will not have any user

276
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:12,530
agents so one advice is to drop any HTTP

277
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:15,650
requests that that that come out of your

278
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:19,129
network in order to stop like poor

279
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:22,550
shelled another orbit or like that so

280
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:26,000
and at the hand of this little script

281
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:28,928
the restart just the backdoor and why

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,240
they do that is just in order to prevent

283
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:36,580
some information

284
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:41,020
leaking in memory and this backdoor was

285
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:43,809
used and dropped by some documents so

286
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:47,230
you have I don't think that you see very

287
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:50,820
well the document but regarding Neto you

288
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:55,210
Korean Conflict and stuff like that and

289
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:58,270
today we are still like investigating on

290
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:00,820
it but there is some ties like in the

291
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:04,629
infrastructure with the surface you guys

292
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:09,070
so maybe there's tasting new stuff

293
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:12,970
maybe it's it's not a test but it's

294
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:21,100
interesting to see some actors that try

295
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:25,890
to innovate with new thing so I will

296
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:28,600
take water because the beer it sir but

297
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,390
the next question is do we have reached

298
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:38,260
the tangent the tangent in cyber

299
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:42,220
espionage operation and Turkish I will

300
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:45,820
explain why is that when you see a Yahoo

301
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:50,380
like that I don't think that everybody

302
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:52,750
is familiar with the house but it's it's

303
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,380
a rule for like pattern matching against

304
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:58,120
malware and we use that in a lot of

305
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,040
things you can do a lot of things with

306
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,510
that Marv well Chris during you can

307
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,678
catch malware on networks on memory

308
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:10,480
learn stuff like that

309
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:15,010
and so you have a rule that was one part

310
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,559
of the route time of the equation Marv

311
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:21,960
are in order to defeat the payload the

312
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:26,470
fact is the equation group use this

313
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:32,170
method and quite the same keys in every

314
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:37,929
equation Marvel so it it was quite easy

315
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:40,809
for any any security researcher to grab

316
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:42,090
like in the noise of various total rows

317
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:44,668
or any

318
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:48,418
any malware repository equation malware

319
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:51,570
and so a simple Yahoo like that can

320
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:55,109
catch many many equation malware and we

321
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:57,450
can discover many many victims so many

322
00:19:55,109 --> 00:20:00,779
years of intelligence operation because

323
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,989
like most of the security researcher are

324
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:09,809
thinking about how well for Stuxnet it

325
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:12,119
was like 10 guys during 6 months but no

326
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:14,609
the equation malware's and stuff like

327
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:16,379
that they were employed during years and

328
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:20,999
years and years in intelligence

329
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:24,359
operation and it was quite bad for the

330
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:27,839
actor bein hits because we can just

331
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:32,158
discover all of the victim of this

332
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:34,918
operation so here is a I think it's a

333
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,440
famous map of the victim of equation R

334
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:45,029
where so you have years of intelligence

335
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:50,599
operation that just broke by simple

336
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:55,349
errors and we have seen during the

337
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:57,689
previous during the previous year many

338
00:20:55,349 --> 00:21:02,759
and many leaks regarding like some

339
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:03,779
toolkits Sancta shadow brokers what yeah

340
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,039
it's ok

341
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:12,749
thanks shattered broker vol 7 etc and we

342
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:17,249
think that the attacker with thing

343
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:21,179
different regarding that using light see

344
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:23,820
cyber criminal just they will use like

345
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:27,839
open-source tool stuff like that even

346
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:31,918
like for long long time cyber espionage

347
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:33,418
operation and so they will relay or

348
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,529
fourth party collections

349
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:40,769
I think that everyone or not is aware of

350
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:43,919
that for party collection as mentioned

351
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:46,440
by the Snowden documents it's just when

352
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,750
you have malware on the workstation you

353
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,480
you

354
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:58,650
you try with seconds to interact with it

355
00:21:51,480 --> 00:22:00,990
or simply to to to get data that is

356
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:04,800
exchanged between the malware and it's

357
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:09,020
situ and if you remembered right X and

358
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:12,659
carbonic you have exactly the same

359
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:16,440
exactly the same stuff in like Snowden

360
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:21,059
ducts if I remember the name it it was

361
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:28,080
the different while you and it was not

362
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:32,550
like today it was in 2010 so we are we

363
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:36,780
are late regarding that and I think that

364
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:40,649
most of the focus of actual that have

365
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:43,889
very good against stuff and operation

366
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:47,160
they will focus on the three topics how

367
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:49,200
to use like hope and so smart we're

368
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,559
beginning in in order to get inside

369
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:58,110
network without being seen and how to

370
00:22:52,559 --> 00:23:04,790
get exfiltrated data just by fourth

371
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:08,000
party collection I think that it's all

372
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:11,700
so thanks for attrition and to conclude

373
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,580
high of just one world is that ok I work

374
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,570
for for antivirus companies stuff like

375
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:25,260
that but remember one thing is sharing

376
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:30,409
is caring and if you work like for

377
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:33,780
private entity private entities

378
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:36,270
governmental - etc don't be shy to

379
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:41,070
exchange many of IOC so you have

380
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:48,420
different stuff like for us name many

381
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:50,280
people exchange like is a md5 ash shall

382
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,220
want stuff like that but they don't

383
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,290
share like the attackers lost name and

384
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,810
for anything inside the network it's

385
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,560
very cool because you just have to look

386
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,940
on your event log

387
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:06,970
and see if there is not a strange choice

388
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,130
name and you can also diff the Earth's

389
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:14,620
name in the heavens log a deep evil

390
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:17,200
clock for example and and the existence

391
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,760
of name on your network and you will see

392
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,830
I think pretty bad thing and after that

393
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,920
infrastructure but with dates etc

394
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:30,090
Porsche Olivier me icons created on the

395
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:34,720
active directories it's a good sort of

396
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:37,720
thing just to hunt bad guys very quickly

397
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,110
inside the network so thanks you very

398
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,110
much

399
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,060
[Applause]
