1
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,420
good morning everybody welcome to my

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,980
talk

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,580
it's about Brandenburg data encryption

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,480
made easy first of all to revert so it

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,300
is considered out of the word ransom for

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,970
for ransom in English and the common

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,120
word of where it is like used for

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,210
blackmailing people the whole software

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:30,810
so first to the history of ransomware it

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:35,100
started 1989 there was the H conference

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,550
and some guy distributed infected floppy

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,610
drives with ransomware on it and yeah

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,980
they caught the developer and put him

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,810
into jail and still it was quite

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,519
distributed over the world of diskettes

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,500
with the floppy disks so it's quite

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,579
interesting to see that it really

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,809
disputed to the world with the diskette

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:59,700
still it was offline the first internet

20
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:04,890
internet attack was we are that Troy PGP

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:06,600
coder it was around 2005 and malware

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,420
developer wanted couple of hundred

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:16,158
dollars of ransom of the people today

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,899
there are a lot of infections especially

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,649
in a meantime a lot of big companies are

26
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:24,779
affected and it's quite a problem for it

27
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,700
for all the companies because they have

28
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:30,240
a lot of money loss because of not

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,969
working systems there is estimation at

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,699
around 1/4 of the people are paying the

31
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:38,579
ransom to the ransomware developers but

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,240
the estimated number of cases are for

33
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,008
sure higher that more people pay it

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,048
there are a lot of different versions of

35
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,209
friendsand where there is like low key

36
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,659
telecrib crypto wall it's just a

37
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:54,240
selection but there are a couple more

38
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:56,579
although the colors say if there is in

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,408
this case decryptor available that you

40
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,770
can decrypt the ransomware for free if

41
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:08,080
the implementation is made bad

42
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:13,049
so random variability that was like two

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:16,810
years ago one a half year ago it was a

44
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,569
hospital in u.s. they got random Varitek

45
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:23,200
and in the end they paid 40 bitcoins

46
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:25,929
that was around 15,000 euro this 15,000

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,030
euro at this time so I think they would

48
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,160
better invest in a backup strategy and

49
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,530
backup solution instead of paying the

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,910
ransom but they paid the 15,000 euro in

51
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:41,319
bitcoins the next thing is quite fun

52
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:43,120
it's called popcorn time it's it's a

53
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,310
random where when you get infected you

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,950
have two two options you pay the ransom

55
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,290
or you are you in fact two other friends

56
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,280
of you and if they pay the ransom you

57
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,120
get your key back

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,890
it's like quite a snowball effect so

59
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,079
yeah you can choose to pay the ransom or

60
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,129
you just infect to other people and they

61
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,200
will pay for you and you will get the

62
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:07,959
ransom that your keys to decrypt your

63
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:10,268
files the next one is quite interesting

64
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,290
it's called codon high it's a version of

65
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:16,900
petia it there was before there were a

66
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,750
text that they sent sent to the a chair

67
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,670
descent application for a job but they

68
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,540
were not personalised so it didn't work

69
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:28,149
all the time but at Goldeneye are random

70
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:31,328
where they really targeted the companies

71
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,220
and they send personalized applications

72
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:36,970
to jobs so they really wrote for which

73
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,709
special jobs they apply for and so that

74
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,720
the chance was much higher that the

75
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,359
people will open the file if they see

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,340
it's like a legit application for a job

77
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:47,440
and with this like kind of social

78
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,569
engineering they managed it that a lot

79
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:55,720
of more companies get infected by

80
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:59,950
ransomware so as you all know there was

81
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:03,940
wanna cry it was used there was used the

82
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:08,108
zero day in in Windows which was patched

83
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:10,450
like two to two months before but not

84
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:12,219
everyone patched it it was a really big

85
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,469
financial loss for some companies

86
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,560
because they didn't have their system

87
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,480
updated and got all

88
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,389
the whole infrastructure infected by

89
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,660
random there and yeah

90
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:28,340
what would Tony will do

91
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:30,139
I think his his see second second thing

92
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,760
he would say I would probably if you

93
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:35,600
could update with Windows right now that

94
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:39,969
would be great I would also like to

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:45,530
present you a guide to getting infected

96
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:48,410
so there is here an example email with

97
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,750
links to ransomware it was like before a

98
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,260
goldeneye that was the email for a job

99
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,300
application which was not personalized

100
00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,409
so it was just a general application for

101
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,740
for a job and in the email it's standing

102
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,470
yeah my my my files are too big so i

103
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,820
upload it to Dropbox so the application

104
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,430
files where in some Dropbox II from

105
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,460
infected files so that the people

106
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,479
downloaded the files from Dropbox open

107
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:20,109
the file and got infected so one way to

108
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:23,630
getting infected this office macros so

109
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:28,610
Word or Excel there are quite a

110
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,950
interesting ways to that people would

111
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:35,840
like to activate macros so they have

112
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:39,080
quite a quite a good plans to like this

113
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,119
file so there is a lot of rubbish in

114
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,070
this file and there is text standing

115
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,590
there like enable macro if the at

116
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,630
encoding is incorrect so people will

117
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,340
like think oh my my word document is

118
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,139
broken I will activate the macros and

119
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,289
then it will work and in the in the end

120
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:57,470
I will get impacted by ransomware the

121
00:05:54,289 --> 00:06:01,400
next thing is way better in my opinion

122
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:05,180
it's you see a blurred text at the

123
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,549
bottom and there is like standing to

124
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,110
security reasons this text is blurred to

125
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,020
unblurred the text please activate

126
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,240
macros so it seems even more legit and

127
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,740
people will just activate the macro if

128
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,400
they have no clue and then they will

129
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,789
still also get infected by ransomware

130
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,799
another way to get in fact is like PDFs

131
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:26,479
there are security holes in a PDF format

132
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
or in the reader like Adobe Acrobat

133
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,280
Reader and often they're like

134
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,520
zero days use they're not known to the

135
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,650
public that you get infected for sure

136
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,930
also some of the attacks are like also

137
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,729
targeted hacks to companies with this

138
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:46,580
zero days included another thing is

139
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:50,180
adult flash player so it's like just a

140
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,340
tool with a bunch of exploits and holes

141
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,740
and all the stuff so I should recommend

142
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,169
that you don't use this stuff anymore if

143
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,270
possible

144
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,980
another attack vector is a Java drive-by

145
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,390
attack so if you have Java nailed in

146
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,700
your browser and going to malicious

147
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,860
sites web sites it could be that to just

148
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,080
start Java and download in the in the

149
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,750
background some software and execute it

150
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,349
and you will never even know and not

151
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,910
even see that that it happens he will

152
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,370
just happen a background and execute it

153
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,920
and then you're infected but normally

154
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:27,920
nor nowadays Java is deactivated for a

155
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:31,300
standard yeah what happens exactly there

156
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,830
are different methods for for encryption

157
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,230
they are different that the extension

158
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,570
encrypted it depends on a random very

159
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,910
often the developer can choose what

160
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,370
extensions they want to encrypt like

161
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,840
they want all the mp3s and all the audio

162
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,060
files and all the pictures encrypted or

163
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,159
random baricza crypts everything except

164
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,980
the windows folder so it really depends

165
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,570
on the ransomware there's like the

166
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:58,370
blackmailing message that they want to

167
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:02,240
money of you optional also count on that

168
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:05,270
people would have some stress and would

169
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,850
rather pay for the ransom because like

170
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,549
in 24 hours your files got getting being

171
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,170
deleted

172
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:15,140
yeah the deletion of that is also one

173
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,290
way that you can improve your success

174
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,909
rate as ransomware developer because

175
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,660
then people would like say okay I don't

176
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,550
have backups

177
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,190
I need my file so will pay my ransom and

178
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,020
then it will not get deleted and it is

179
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,850
also a possible scenario that people

180
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,169
blackmail you with your debt and publish

181
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,840
it to the internet or something like

182
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:37,970
this if it's like sensitive data or just

183
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,890
as just another blackmail method so for

184
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,920
the

185
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,900
for the simple way is how it is

186
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,969
encrypted how is the encryption work

187
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,959
working so normally the files are

188
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:53,620
encrypted symmetric with a s and the AES

189
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,990
key getting encrypted with RSA public

190
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,180
key and normally on the server of the

191
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,990
malware developers they are the errors

192
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,550
our private key and so the people if

193
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,650
they pay the ransom they will get there

194
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,750
is our private key and then they have

195
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,490
their own tools there on the computer

196
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,770
which they give you that you equip the

197
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,170
files again but there are also other

198
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:18,579
ways of encryption possible so petty our

199
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:20,920
Goldeneye uses the way of encrypting the

200
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,130
filesystem table and changing the Master

201
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,050
Boot Record so in the end do you have to

202
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,790
filesystem table which is like an index

203
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,240
of all your files on the file system in

204
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,040
Windows and if we encrypt this table you

205
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,130
don't have any clue very files on the

206
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,469
hard disk so at this at this part of

207
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,870
encryption you can use like some photo

208
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,940
recovery software or some software that

209
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,190
you can find the files on the hardest

210
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,950
with two magic numbers but you have no

211
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,050
clue very hard disk so in this case you

212
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,120
still can recover some files with some

213
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:56,680
recovery tools to find them on a hard

214
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,500
disk so the thing is how how do I

215
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,199
protect me so the first thing is like

216
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,650
make your backups so packets are very

217
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,480
important and if you say you don't use

218
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,240
backups tell me more about this genius

219
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,680
plan of data loss it's like if you

220
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,820
really don't do backups it could really

221
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,550
go really wrong there are various ways

222
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,500
of backups there's like you can back up

223
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,449
your signal files you can make a whole

224
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,280
image of the hard disk you can make

225
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,220
incremental backups remote I kept on the

226
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,810
file server differential you have a lot

227
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,670
of possibilities how you do your backups

228
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,189
so it's up to you what you want to

229
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,660
choose for some scenarios like other

230
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:39,670
makeups don't you is better than other

231
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:43,660
one and also think about software

232
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:46,209
licenses so use of profiles of programs

233
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,860
also like firefox thunderbird so i

234
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,900
recommend for the software licenses that

235
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,970
you have some some central place where

236
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,030
you can place them like some folder

237
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,000
or offline in some the codes in some map

238
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,740
or something like this and for the user

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,870
little profile program of programs

240
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,480
they're often in some hidden folders on

241
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,950
windows so you you need to locate it

242
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,500
sometimes it's in the in the local

243
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:13,030
roaming folder and it's normally hidden

244
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,190
by windows and and for passwords I

245
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,100
recommend like password managers which

246
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,560
you can easily migrate to a new system

247
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,780
so use I recommend use of pest manager

248
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,930
get put a password on and then you have

249
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:29,530
a whole program you have all your

250
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:32,829
passwords in a database also very

251
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:35,890
important is copies of all the files and

252
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,410
the local computer are not safe so if

253
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,270
you have on the same hard disk five more

254
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,430
copies of the of Europe of your data

255
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,920
it's not safe

256
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,949
also I'm not not also not on another

257
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,829
petition of the same hard disk so if

258
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:55,690
your heart is crushed then your data is

259
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:57,910
lost so you have to make backups on an

260
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,210
external drive or an extra hard drive on

261
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,370
an extra logical hard drive and so

262
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,400
physical hard drive that you have that

263
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,950
say that's a safe so normally as far as

264
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:13,510
I know a copies then a copy fifth like

265
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:17,080
two copies of one file and that often

266
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,880
people forget that it's not safe to save

267
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,370
the files on there on the hard disk on

268
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,490
this another partition and they don't

269
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,520
know it when they've lost their data so

270
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:31,510
yeah back up all the things it's really

271
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,560
important especially it could only can

272
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,170
happen that you get infected by

273
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,760
ransomware it can happen that your room

274
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,410
gets looted and you're left with protein

275
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,160
it can happen that you get stolen your

276
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,900
device it can happen that a funder

277
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,569
strike strikes into your laptop whatever

278
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,860
so it's like all-in-one solution for

279
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:53,440
your data if you get lost them and yeah

280
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,080
also crucial is if you test your backup

281
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,910
if you don't test your backup in the

282
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,520
worst case it's not working to restore

283
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,610
it and then you're like sitting there so

284
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,569
 my files are away so testing is

285
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,900
essential so

286
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:10,300
I recommend to testify cups because in

287
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,000
the worst case it will not work maybe

288
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,510
you heard of get lub they had some

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,170
incident like some months ago the the

290
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:24,610
coder the the suicide means somehow

291
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:26,920
deleted the the wrong database and yeah

292
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,910
it was like in the end they lost like

293
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,099
five or eight hours of work in data of

294
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,670
all the customers which had to atone get

295
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,740
lot and yeah they had like five backup

296
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:43,329
strategies and none of them worked in

297
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:45,820
the end so in the end not have better

298
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,470
procedures but like you can learn from

299
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,620
Gita but even it happens to big

300
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:54,460
companies that they fail at restoring

301
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:57,040
the backup I have some more software

302
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,490
recommendations that's like it's

303
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,110
probably most of them are for Windows

304
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,030
there is like the Paragon backup

305
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,310
recovery for free it's a muscle tools

306
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,410
are like free tools there is areca

307
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,859
backup this is a Java implementation of

308
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,230
a backup tool it also works on Linux

309
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,240
there is all my backup and also the

310
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,430
Windows internals backup tool is also

311
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,760
quite good it's easy to use for normal

312
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:24,130
people and it's quite powerful so if you

313
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,990
don't have a lot of knowledge you should

314
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,800
use the windows you don't know backup

315
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,270
tool for backup

316
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,510
next I recommend for sure update

317
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,240
antivirus software up-to-date antivirus

318
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:41,470
software but it's not the Holy Grail so

319
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,160
it's it's extra thing but you it will

320
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:47,920
not save you from from Oliver because

321
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,620
sometimes Mora can evade antivirus

322
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,300
software and so it's just extra

323
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,200
protection but it's not the Holy Grail

324
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,990
for protecting against mauler very

325
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:03,820
important is update up-to-date operating

326
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:06,580
system run several programs like you saw

327
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:12,940
at Wallach try there was a hole in the

328
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:14,890
SMB exploit and so if the sis have been

329
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,720
patched the system's two months ago they

330
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,769
would not get affected by wanna cry but

331
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,649
they didn't I don't

332
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:21,850
why but in the end it was quite a pain

333
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:27,610
in the ass afterwards to clean

334
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:29,889
everything up so first of all you get

335
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,009
more security when updating your systems

336
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:36,189
and your tools and if you can also maybe

337
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:38,980
new features for your programs also

338
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:41,290
quite a interesting or important thing

339
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,449
is if you use windows turn on the

340
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,779
windows file extensions they are by

341
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:50,229
default off if for unknown file

342
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,699
extensions so they turn on turn off defy

343
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,819
extensions for like known file like

344
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:57,420
executable or like PDF or whatever so

345
00:15:54,819 --> 00:16:00,849
you can create files that are like

346
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,009
invoice dot PDF to excel and you and the

347
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,499
people just see invoice dot PDF and then

348
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:10,350
they click it on start it and then just

349
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:13,119
running our executable also important

350
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,579
deactivated up flash better uninstall it

351
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:18,189
I think soon it will be not even

352
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:21,008
supported by the major a browser vendors

353
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:26,199
so all in all it's it's time to switch

354
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:28,509
to a new system like html5 because it's

355
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:30,219
it's full of security holes they in the

356
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:32,279
past they patch it like every week or

357
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:37,110
every every month if really critical

358
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:39,429
critical exploits in there also

359
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,529
important thing is like email and

360
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:43,929
attachments you should miss trustees so

361
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:46,569
sometimes people can send you emails

362
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:48,759
with some malware in it and sometimes

363
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:50,439
people don't even know that they have

364
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,119
modernists on the system in the malware

365
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:55,299
itself sends email to the whole address

366
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:57,220
book so if you get some fish email maybe

367
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:59,170
you contact the person you got the email

368
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,230
from if you know it if you know the

369
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,969
person and ask them maybe if they sent

370
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,620
the email if maybe they don't even know

371
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:10,360
that they got infected by malware so as

372
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,279
I said it's something is really

373
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,928
important to ask people if they really

374
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:17,589
sent the email because they maybe don't

375
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:19,990
even know that they are infected also

376
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:24,490
important is like no administration

377
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:27,309
privileges it so work with limited user

378
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,300
privileges it doesn't protect from

379
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:29,889
ransomware

380
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,770
that will be still encrypted from your

381
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:36,280
home drive and it's somehow other

382
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,050
provides false false security but with

383
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,580
that you will just get encrypted your

384
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,169
home that and not to hold that on a

385
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,760
whole computer so if multiple users

386
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,740
using the computer you will just get

387
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,970
encrypted your home drive and not all

388
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:52,840
that of all users so you will you will

389
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:55,570
no need to recover a whole backups you

390
00:17:52,840 --> 00:18:00,639
will just need to take import your own

391
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:04,450
backup then so the other thing is like

392
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,970
no plying enough unknown flash drives so

393
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,250
they can be infected or they can even be

394
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,140
a killer USB that destroys your computer

395
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:15,340
there are some devices like this out

396
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:17,260
there yeah there also unknown USB flash

397
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,149
drives also used for a social

398
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,190
engineering day like put it in front of

399
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,990
some companies and they see if people

400
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,540
are getting it into the company and

401
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,550
plugging it into their computer so it

402
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,379
can also be a thing that people bring it

403
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,210
into the company a plug it in and then

404
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:36,430
the computer in company got affected and

405
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:38,440
get the backdoor for a attacker another

406
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,630
thing is if you have some suspicious

407
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,700
files you can check it online there is

408
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,580
like virustotal calm

409
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,110
I recommend don't upload private data

410
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,629
because you don't know what will happen

411
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,360
afterwards with it but if this tool you

412
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,850
can check files if they're like infected

413
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,649
and they check it like 40 antivirus

414
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,610
software tools and give you the result

415
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:04,030
of the of the result of the check

416
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:06,010
another thing is use Linux so there are

417
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,550
quite a lot of user friendly systems out

418
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,900
there like a boon to Linux Mint Debian

419
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:14,399
you have quite a there is even a more

420
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:17,080
tenon Linux if you like and the thing is

421
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,120
most of the random most malware and the

422
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,310
ransomware are used in the in the

423
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,070
Windows operating system because most of

424
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,929
people using Windows and so it's the the

425
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,720
profit the most profitable target for

426
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:31,930
the malware developer they are also more

427
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,300
there for Linux and for Mac OS but the

428
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:37,330
most small wrists like implemented for

429
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:40,700
Windows and yeah

430
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,889
also brain actually you use must so

431
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,580
you also should think about should I

432
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:48,320
open this file or should I delete it so

433
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:52,370
often the human is like the weakest part

434
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:56,659
in the link on in IT security site on

435
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:58,760
the user base at office so sometimes

436
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:03,400
maybe think twice before opening a file

437
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:06,860
or some click on some suspicious link

438
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,160
yeah back up so as I already told you

439
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:14,419
very important you should do it and it

440
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:18,470
will it will save us probably so there

441
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:21,350
is a quick summary so if you got

442
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,600
infected by ransomware what should I do

443
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:29,510
first of all turn off your computer

444
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:32,080
immediately so pull the plug or press

445
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:36,050
the power of button till it's it's all

446
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,980
shut down put live system from flash or

447
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:44,389
drive cd/dvd and try to rescue some data

448
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:46,670
if it's still unencrypted and yeah then

449
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,710
you can detect a random earth like with

450
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,910
the file extension or if the message you

451
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,900
got

452
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:56,510
then reinstall your filesystem your your

453
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,000
operating system again so I recommend to

454
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,680
make a full clean install because you

455
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,080
never know if there's still some that

456
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,390
left after of some malware which can

457
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,040
load other stuff so I recommend to

458
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,680
really reinstall the whole operating

459
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,370
system and in the end restore your

460
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:18,320
backup so you have no backup oh yeah

461
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:20,719
that's quite bad like really make backup

462
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,970
it will it will it will make your life

463
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,520
easier yeah

464
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,970
now it's demo time I have a demo for you

465
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,970
with me

466
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:09,399
so I have here my virtual machine I have

467
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:15,610
here first to see here there's jigsaw or

468
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:22,989
PDF to excel if i deactivate one don't

469
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:33,279
so if i deactivate the known file

470
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:35,740
extensions you will just see it's so you

471
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:39,370
see here there is a chick sorted PDF but

472
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:44,500
it's it's a executable so if you check

473
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:46,779
out things it's it's excel executable

474
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,700
the other funny thing is first of all

475
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:52,210
there is description here it's a firefox

476
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:55,600
and the other thing anything is if you

477
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:58,389
check the details or the original file

478
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,620
called a bitcoin blackmail or an excel

479
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:05,590
so it's really good implemented and so

480
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,779
we will play like not a user which have

481
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,600
no clue so we'll just start this file

482
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:13,720
it seems legit it's it's a PDF ok let's

483
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,428
start it okay there comes the USC prompt

484
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,880
i have other tools also which don't

485
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:22,510
get--don't to ause prompt so i'll

486
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,450
execute it then it's someone want to

487
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:27,250
start to dropbox on excel okay I really

488
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,529
want to install Dropbox every time so

489
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:33,970
let's do it then

490
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:36,519
some there is a message saying thank you

491
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:39,190
with some Red Cross I don't know

492
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:41,260
that makes no sense and it's telling me

493
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,810
yeah myself is registered and there is a

494
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,370
confirmation code and yeah email us

495
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,590
in the chat to activate your software

496
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:52,629
okay I will say it's great

497
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:56,110
damn we will check the task manager you

498
00:23:52,630 --> 00:24:01,180
will see there is a process the Dropbox

499
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:05,830
and exit it needs it needs quite a lot

500
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:08,250
of CPU time and the funny thing is the

501
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:11,710
Dropbox on Excel file but with

502
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:14,650
description Firefox so it's also very

503
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,180
very implemented and yeah it's now

504
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,130
starting to implement stuff

505
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:22,450
I have here some folders with some

506
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:24,910
wallpapers with some music documents and

507
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,350
a fear folder of office documents and

508
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,950
there is one funny thing at this

509
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:32,230
ransomware oh yes this file here and if

510
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:37,060
you checked things

511
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:41,530
it's a XLT file but XLT is in caps and

512
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:45,280
FRX OT file this one and this is not in

513
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:47,470
caps and you will see that it will

514
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,620
encrypt all their files of the office

515
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:53,410
staff expect this this first one where

516
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:56,129
the Excel T's in caps because something

517
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:59,320
case sensitive so it ignores this file

518
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,790
so it's already done so it it encrypted

519
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,990
already in my virtual machine it's quite

520
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:07,600
fast

521
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:11,080
so it makes fun of files so there's

522
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,659
everything got fun files except my first

523
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,470
one it's also working so it didn't the

524
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,450
trip encrypt the dot XLT file in caps so

525
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:24,490
the whole resume is case sensitive so

526
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:26,920
this file is still working so it's still

527
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,650
crypting the stuff the wallpapers or

528
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,690
wallpaper out still encrypted also rains

529
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,930
wearisome often also use the hardware

530
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:39,190
encryption and the hardware processor

531
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:41,260
for encrypting files even faster so

532
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,660
we'll wait oh there is a ransom message

533
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:46,629
this is chick saw the chicks are

534
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,570
ransomware yeah my files are being

535
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,990
encrypted your photos videos documents

536
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,990
et Cie

537
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:04,010
but don't worry I have not deleted them

538
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,899
yet you have 25 25 24 hours to pay 150

539
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,129
US dollar in bitcoins to get an

540
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:12,530
encryption key for the Bitcoin stuff

541
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:16,220
resume developers are quite interested

542
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:19,250
to get their money so it's it's their

543
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,990
business that they decrypt your files if

544
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,060
you pay them so it's their business plan

545
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,740
so in the end you will get most of the

546
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,129
time your files back if you pay the

547
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,420
ransom but I don't recommend it and

548
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:32,180
there are even more resin where a

549
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,890
developer tree chef really a support

550
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,360
chat like you can chat with them and

551
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,490
they give you instructions how to get

552
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,469
bitcoins it's like like really really a

553
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,180
customer service they offer you for

554
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,750
paying the rent for the paying the

555
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,400
ransom there even some random Avella

556
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:50,000
perhaps even hot lights or it could call

557
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,590
there was one case some barber shop got

558
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,630
infected by ransomware and they didn't

559
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,980
have money to pay it so they called them

560
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,110
and they say yeah we have a barber shop

561
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,660
and we don't have enough money to pay it

562
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:02,120
and they say yeah okay just pay $100 and

563
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,470
we decrypt your files so they even also

564
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,330
sometimes kinda give you just some

565
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:09,710
discount but they freely they know that

566
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,780
most of the people have no clue about

567
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,810
bitcoins and therefore they will offer

568
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:19,040
you a support how to get your files back

569
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:21,530
and how to acquire bitcoins so it will

570
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:25,639
be nearly finished the thing is it's a

571
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:29,000
visual basic oh they don't even made a

572
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,080
customer acting so the thing is here is

573
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,120
now the ransomware

574
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,300
you see it's really bad even the Texas

575
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:38,959
didn't fit on a whole page here we have

576
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:41,480
a countdown so in one hour one file will

577
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,280
be littered there are some that's a

578
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,800
Bitcoin address but I want to send the

579
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,200
bitcoins and if you must always to show

580
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,139
you which files are encrypted so okay

581
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,430
that's all the encrypted files they did

582
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,870
so it's a nice service so I can check

583
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,410
out which file I should recover from a

584
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:59,600
backup and so I think oh my god my

585
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,150
father's are encrypted I will just shut

586
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,530
down my PC okay so I go and want to shut

587
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:06,410
down my PC

588
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:09,770
and then you're about to make a very bad

589
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:15,310
decision I'm sure about it yeah okay I

590
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:19,910
will just turn it off yes

591
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:21,679
so I don't know but sometimes it

592
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,390
happened that the tour ends in Berlin it

593
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,260
gets out to start so it will start again

594
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:31,310
and sometimes if you can restart it it

595
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,410
will delete already some files so we can

596
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:36,050
check it out now as the last thing if if

597
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:39,410
we deleted some files so sometimes have

598
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:42,290
not it and popped up again and then told

599
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:59,000
me yeah like 20 of your files got

600
00:28:42,290 --> 00:29:00,920
deleted yeah until it boots up so first

601
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,540
of all thank you for listening if you

602

also speak to me at the venue here you

610
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,419
can have some samples I have still more

611
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,480
stress over samples if you interested in

612
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:29,290
we can we can change samples if you like

613
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,290
thank you

614
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:40,330
so I run I started it again so now it's

615
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:42,668
starting a fire focused on XF okay I

616
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:46,240
don't know why my firefighting also

617
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:50,320
start but okay I will approve it then

618
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:53,890
you will see there is a Firefox when you

619
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:57,789
check it out it it's in the roaming in

620
00:29:53,890 --> 00:30:02,559
FFX folder and it's a Firefox it still

621
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:05,710
have the Bitcoin blackmailer access as

622
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,750
original file but now at least the

623
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,570
description is correct of the of Texas

624
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,039
to table but I will just check it again

625
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:22,689
and then start again the Loki file

626
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:24,280
screen so some questions no one okay so

627
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,780
if interested enough still more samples

628
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,520
I can show you then afterwards if you

629
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,110
interested I have some there are some

630
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,580
really ridiculous stuff like there is

631
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,459
the ransomware where you have to play a

632
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:36,699
game and reach like two billion points

633
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:39,909
did you get their files decrypted there

634
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:43,659
is even some really bad rains were

635
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:45,669
called Hitler ransomware before typo and

636
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:47,710
it's really bad implemented and they

637
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:49,480
don't want Bitcoin they want 25 year

638
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:56,440
waterfall cash card for your telephone

639
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:59,200
so yeah I mean I think I will I will

640
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,240
stop here probably there will be some

641
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,960
files deleted if we interested we can

642
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,530
check it out later

643
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,530
thank you very much

644
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,879
you
