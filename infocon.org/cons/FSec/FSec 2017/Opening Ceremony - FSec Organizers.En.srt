70
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,140
least 300 people the same as last year

71

214
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,599
these are indeed every year I try to say

215
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,810
a few words about the trends of

216
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,519
information security and to keep this

217
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,160
rant short I'm going to shorten this up

218
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,199
we saw one a cry on petia give us the

219
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,750
scientific proof that just patch isn't

220
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:24,490
working if you ask any man in the

221
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,750
medical industry you will see that it's

222
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,240
not that simple and there are some

223
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,910
interesting points to go across we see

224
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,819
people that want backdoors and backdoor

225
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,139
entry built by design into systems but

226
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:36,790
they still can't keep their tools

227
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:39,550
private and eventually innocent people

228
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,740
get hurt and the damages are counted in

229
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,540
hundreds of millions of dollars this

230
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,269
won't get any better and as long as

231
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,639
everyone from defense of offense

232
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:51,610
governments from government to hackers

233
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,319
to professionals doesn't start working

234
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,550
together to collaboratively solve

235
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:58,569
problems we won't see any way better in

236
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,939
this world

237
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,290
security is a multi-faceted problem you

238
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,050
are here to solve some of these issues

239
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,480
communicate transfer knowledge transfer

240
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,209
ideas collaborate that's the only way to

241
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,850
go for it

242
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:15,010
F SEC is a interesting corn something

243
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,020
between a hacker corn and InfoSec on a

244
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,380
round table discussion everything where

245
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,540
everybody can exchange ideas on neutral

246
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,730
ground the best way if you want

247
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,469
something is to organize it and help

248
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,120
with organization so if you have any

249
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,160
ideas

small by conference between our sizes

264
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:22,150
seven years ago it grew just like a

265
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,790
child you put to run in the world so now

266
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:29,410
we can only happily see that the

267
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:34,150
conference really made it say to the

268
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:36,449
community so many people really witness

269
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,230
that there is something very interesting

270
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:42,460
happening in the field of information

271
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:45,400
security and this is the topic worth to

272
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:49,930
be discussed and experiences to be

273
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:53,800
shared we as a faculty will continue to

274
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:55,359
support the conference we are doing many

275
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,390

276
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,390
information security and I hope that in

277
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:05,650
such mutual environment and exchange of

278
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:07,990
opinions we can really achieve some

279
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,329

280
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,980
