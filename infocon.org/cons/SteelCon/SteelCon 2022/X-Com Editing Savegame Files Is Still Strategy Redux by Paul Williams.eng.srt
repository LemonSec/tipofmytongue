1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,640
um

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,520
so this is welcome to my talk uh it's uh

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,679
xcom editing saved games is still

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,920
strategy because you know in my opinion

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
is um i did this talk already once last

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
year uh like i said as i mentioned

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,320
previously i had a couple of issues can

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,840
you hear me all right everyone yeah yeah

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,720
cool i had a couple of issues where

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,359
you know computers didn't work and

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,199
projectors didn't work everybody works

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,519
in itr knows of technical problems we

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,439
tried turning off and on again that

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,640
didn't work

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,399
so i thought right well i'll submit it

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,559
again the next time anybody's due for a

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,480
talk right so

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
here we are um

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,600
right so

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,559
who am i uh i'm paul i'm a

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,480

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,879
consultant i also

23

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,559
lot of conferences in the uk now

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,160
but obviously like everybody else it's

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,440
been a while since we've done anything

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
like that because

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
you know lock down and various other

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,199
things uh i'm also a member of uh

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,879
manchester gray hats

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,040
if any of you uh from around manchester

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,960
area it's we've not done anything for a

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,439
while but because of you know the

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,720
lockdown and that

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,320
but we should start kicking the things

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,080
back up again soon so we used to do like

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
talks and workshops and things like that

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
for various things uh it's on twitter

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,439
but i forgot to put twitter handles in

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,240
here

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,640
um but if you see me about later on just

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,880
come talk to me and

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,360
i'll give you the twitter handles

44
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
so

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
why did i do this talk so

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,880
as i mentioned when you first we also

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,600
started coming in um

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,320
i like old old xcom games um it was the

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,159
first game i ever played on a real pc

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,920
you know like one of those big beige

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
towers like this before everybody had

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
igb and you know the rest of it what

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,880
cooling pumps when youtube was this big

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
you got it from time or pc world or

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,560
somewhere like that and you know it came

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
with like really weird dos games like

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
theme park and

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,719
uh well x-com and what was the other one

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,520
we got

60
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
sorry firefight yeah uh like a like an

61
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,399
isometric um

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,560
shooter uh but i'm full of all games

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,318
right and um

64
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,959
i wanted to do a talk excuse me

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,000
i wanted to do a talk that was

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
kind of technical and hacking related

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,599
but not necessarily

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,040
in the weeds like

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,400
i'm sure we've all been to talks where

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,920
it's like this like i said like this is

71
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
where i got this zero day in some web

72
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
framework or you know that kind of thing

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
and those talks are kind of cool

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
but they're not for everyone

75
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
sometimes they're a bit too technical so

76
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,480
i thought i'd do something where it's a

77
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,319
little bit on the technical but a little

78
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,400
bit only interesting too

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,000
uh yeah so this was the first game i

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
ever played on a real pc like i said and

81
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,000
uh i've never actually finished it

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
because

83
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,959
i can see some of you laughing

84
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,959
if you played it you know right it's

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,480
really hard

86
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,800
um so i thought right well it's a

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
strategy game and you know

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,519
cheating is a strategy

89
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
and i know i'm only cheating myself

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,680
but you know

91
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
i thought it'd be an interesting project

92
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,280
and if anybody else can benefit from it

93
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,120
then you know maybe maybe you can

94
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
complete it too you know i get some

95
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,840
tweets late when they get home you're

96
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,519
like oh yeah i finished it now because

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,720
because you're uh

98
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,760
you help

99
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,599
um one thing

100
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,959
because it's an old game there are quite

101
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
a few like text files online like we

102
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,560
used to be back in the day where people

103
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
say like if you open up in a hex editor

104
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,760
you can go here and just say you give

105
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,599
yourself infinite money

106
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,680
um but i kind of did it a little bit of

107
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
a different way what i did was i opened

108
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599
the game up i

109
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,519
did various bits and bobs like i sold

110
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,120
all of my stuff to see how much money i

111
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,000
had and then checked what had changed

112
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
so that was a very laborious process of

113
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,519
going if you if any of you work in

114
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,799
software and you've ever dipped

115
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,319
something when you get a

116
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,840
merged conflict you know what i'm

117
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,280
talking about like

118
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
you got on the one side

119
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
a stream text and on the other side a

120
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,480
different stream of text that's almost

121
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,920
exactly the same but only a little bit

122
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,799
different

123
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,720
and uh with it being bytes it's even

124
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,840
harder to read because it's not like the

125
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,879
words so uh yeah um

126
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,680
i basically spluttered my way through

127
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,239
saving it loading it reading

128
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,840
saving a lot of reading and i started to

129
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
generate my own notes

130
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
and then i checked them against what

131
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,319
other people had done so i thought like

132
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,280
you know that would be an interesting

133
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,959
way to do different things

134
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,560
um so once i'd done that i started about

135
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,280
uh writing my own guide to it

136
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,800
but then i thought well why not just

137
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
write it as a program so then people can

138
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
load the save file and they can just

139
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,479
patch it without having to fiddle around

140
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,240
with any kind of hex editors right like

141
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,000
that they can just click a button

142
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,479
give you money click a button

143
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,720
build based stuff

144
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,840
that kind of thing right cool

145
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,880
as i just said uh

146
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
my ramblings on how i did this you know

147
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
back and forwards

148
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
save game editing

149
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,440
i obviously i i kept the sliding i

150
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,120
didn't notice that i was going to make

151
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
the same game during my last talk i have

152
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
actually done it now i did actually

153
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,639
stream quite a lot on twitch but it's

154
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,880
mostly just me swearing into a camera

155
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,320
and you know they're like why is that

156
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
not working or you know that shouldn't

157
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
be that

158
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
again if you're any of your working

159
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
software you know exactly what i'm

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,360
talking about

161
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
um the cool thing as well is because the

162
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,919
first two games are very similar

163
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,680
it will

164
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,320
work on the ufo anymore and get enemy

165
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,600
unknown game

166
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,639
however

167
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,479
the names will won't be the same and

168
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,199
there are slight slight differences from

169
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,479
uh ufo to tftd uh some of the aliens and

170
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,880
things like that are different but

171
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
the money will be the same the base

172
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
location stuff's all the same

173
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,479
and that's that's a version two you know

174
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,160
scope creep and all that kind of thing

175
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,759
um

176
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,880
right so let's get into it

177
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,639
so the basic structure of the save game

178
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,759
files uh if you can see over here uh

179
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,280
the pointer uh

180
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
each file each saved game is its own

181
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,800
folder game

182
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,440
underscore 1 through 10.

183
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,759
and in each of those is basically a

184
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,880
different um different set of dat files

185
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
that hold the data for the saved game

186
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,400
weirdly if you delete one of these and

187
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
try and save it

188
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
it doesn't like that because it's all

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,759
running through dosbox and stuff so it

190
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,520
kind of

191
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
works but doesn't so it tries to save

192
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,720
and then the whole thing crashes out so

193
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,319
don't do that if you're gonna do this

194
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
and you're to play with it yourself back

195
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,319
yourselves up first

196
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
and then start playing and see what what

197
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,319
goes work

198
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
so as i said you've got the

199
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
each of the game

200
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,759
save game fire

201
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,440
numbers

202
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,280
correlates to a folder game one through

203
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
ten

204
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,039
in those there are three files we're

205
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,600
going to be looking at in this talk uh a

206
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,880
store dot dot base dot dot and lib ooh

207
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
li glob dot dot

208
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
so base dot dot is exactly what it

209
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
sounds like it's where the base data is

210
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
stored uh

211
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
lib li globe dot dot is where the money

212
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,039
is stored in the first four bytes of

213
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,319
that file so that's how you give

214
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,599
yourself

215
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,599
not infinite money because

216
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,479
it's a 32-bit signed integer so

217
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,520
obviously once you get past around 2

218
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,360
billion it flips over and goes into

219
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,759
minus money so you don't want to do that

220
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,520
so the caveat there is if you edit your

221
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,440
save and give yourself the maximum

222
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,919
amount of money don't sell anything

223
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,440
because if you sell it

224
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,720
you're going to run money because it'll

225
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
flip all the way around i mean you can

226
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,759
just run the save game editor again

227
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,720
it'll just

228
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
patch it back so it's not really a

229
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,120
problem

230
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,639
but you can give yourself infinite money

231
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,960
uh the other one is the a store.dat

232
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
which is where the aliens are stored so

233
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,080
if you've ever played this game or if

234
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
you've not i'll explain

235
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,479
basically you have to capture aliens and

236
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,000
interrogate them to find out what the

237
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,759
plans are and you capture the higher

238
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,919
ranking aliens to get more information

239
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,599
and eventually have to you have to

240
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,240
capture particular aliens at the end

241
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,960
to

242
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,199
uh get the end mission

243
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,039
uh you visit a city called pleth which

244
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,280
is why the editors called telepathy

245
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,720
because you know i like puns um

246
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,840
so

247
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,120
the way you would normally do that is

248
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
you would have uh stun guns and stuff

249
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,599
like that uh initially you have like a

250
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
melee weapon that you knocked them out

251
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,319
with but you have to get close to them

252
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,319
to knock them out and by doing that

253
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,680
you're going to lose three or four of

254
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,840
you your uh your soldiers because

255
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
when aliens turn to shoot they just kill

256
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
you

257
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,479
um

258
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,879
so you can just drop them in with the

259
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,879
editor you can just pick an alien drop

260
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,440
it in and then it'll be the available

261
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,160
for your research

262
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
so as i said

263
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
the initial plan was to do this as a hex

264
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
editor

265
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,599
but kind of tedious

266
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,559
and

267
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,719
being working in tech when something's

268
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,399
tedious you script it

269
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,360
so first things first

270
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
we need to give ourselves some money so

271
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
the first four bytes of the li glob dot

272
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,880
dot is where your money is stored but

273
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,019
[Music]

274
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,560
no worries um

275
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,959
weirdly though it's uh it's little

276
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,440
indian now if you've ever worked in

277
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,800
with anything with memory you know that

278
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
that means that it's backwards

279
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,320
effectively

280
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
so we have to flip it round

281
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
um

282
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
so instead of it being

283
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
the the larger number at one end it's at

284
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
the other end than where you would

285
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
expect it to be

286
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,839
initially what we what we did was we

287
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
edited this with a hex editor just drop

288
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,760
those four bytes in save it load it

289
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,240
check the uh thing but this time we can

290
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,200
just do max money

291
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,279
as i said uh 2.1 billion is

292
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,640
roughly the uh the maximum amount of

293
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,600
money you want to put in there

294
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040
um

295
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
so what we're going to do now is we're

296
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,839
going to do a uh

297
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,880
demo you ready for a demo everybody

298
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,720
yeah go on yeah yeah

299
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,440
now let's hope that you can see this

300
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,440
properly

301
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,959
as you can see here is my uh pretty

302
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,320
little uh

303
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
hex editor here

304
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
and here is the uh

305
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
the uh the program running so

306
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,040
i don't want to do it live draw a live

307
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
demo everyone or do you want to record

308
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,760
again i don't mind

309
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,680
i'll tell you live we'll do it live

310
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
yeah let's do it i mean it's already

311
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
gone wrong twice so

312
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,640
let's uh

313
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,959
let me pause that

314
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,839
and we'll do it live

315
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,000
it might pop up music now so i don't

316
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,720
know

317
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
simply get nostalgic

318
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,199
oh there you go

319
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,359
we'll skip that bit

320
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,519
so

321
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,200
as you can see we've got one dollar

322
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,760
so we got here

323
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
we

324
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,760
run that

325
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,320
and it maxes out the money

326
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,680
that's it like that i'm sorry

327
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
hmm

328
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,519
i bet i bet this doesn't work now just

329
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,320
got attempted the gods isn't it

330
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,720
and then lord the first

331
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,040
first demo

332
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,880
as you can see

333
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,519
we've now got over 2 billion

334
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,519
now you a lot of you may recognize the

335
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,800
uh

336
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
the name though if you ever looked at

337
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,160
anything with memory you always do

338
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,600
something like this you spray it full of

339
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,279
recognizable characters and then you

340
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,200
open up and see where that is

341
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
which is what they did here

342
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,320
so now we're gonna do uh the next

343
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,320
uh of course i don't actually love you

344
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,560
attempted demo gods again right so as

345
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,000
you can see that was a lot easier than

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,480
finding the the right offsets and doing

347
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,160
all that nonsense

348
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
just run a button click

349
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
done

350
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
so let's get back to the slides

351
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,160
yeah cool

352
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,279
so yeah um

353
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,360
so why the way i structured this as well

354
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,320
um

355
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,399
and i wrote it in python as i may have

356
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,839
mentioned already

357
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,600
i've done it in like a class-based way

358
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
so basically each of the saved game

359
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,720
files that it edits there is

360
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,639
each of them has common properties and

361
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,920
obviously if you've ever done any

362
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,959
programming

363
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,480
you can use things that have common

364
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,160
properties and then you just define them

365
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,480
as as a class and then you can inherit

366
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,240
that class to do things so this is how

367
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
i've done this as an approach i have a

368
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,519
savegame

369
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,079
class which has the mechanism to write

370
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,560
the file back to

371
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,399
the right write the memory back to the

372
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,800
file so that it patches at the top

373
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,480
uh the loading stuff is all taken care

374
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
of in the thing so rather than having to

375
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
have each of these things implemented

376
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
again and again in each of the uh like

377
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,760
li glob dot

378
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,959
and things like that each of these

379
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,839
um

380
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,000
they just disinherit that stuff from the

381
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,560
the save game file class and then

382
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,000
they just call that function and it'll

383
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
just do it which is if you've ever done

384
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,880
any

385
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,800
orp programming

386
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
that's that's the thing it's good for is

387
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,639
uh reducing that kind of complexity

388
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,839
because you can just do it once and

389
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,519
abstract it in every other place where

390
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,240
you use it it's great it's a dry cord

391
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,839
we already did the live demo

392
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,839
so

393
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,000
now we've got all that money

394
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,480
what do we

395
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
call this

396
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
now that we've got all the money uh what

397
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,920
do we want to do now uh we want to build

398
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,760
some stuff right

399
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,079
like you know the builder facilities

400
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,440
because that that's what this game is

401
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,399
about

402
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
so in the the base dot dot we've got a

403
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,079
bunch of different things in there we've

404
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,399
got the name as i mentioned before we've

405
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,320
got stores which is basically where all

406
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480
the the inventory the equipment is so

407
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,600
effectively

408
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
when you recover ships and things like

409
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,279
that on the missions they get stored in

410
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,040
your general stores

411
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,880
uh facility

412
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,040
the issue there is obviously um

413
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,120
that's a finite amount of space

414
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,199
again i mentioned if we sell things we

415
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,560
can recover that space back but then

416
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,600
obviously we want to be careful we don't

417
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,040
sell too much

418
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
because we'll go all the money will go

419
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,880
wrap around and they'll be nicked

420
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,480
excuse me it'll be negative numbers

421
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
again

422
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,639
um

423
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,240
so

424
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,199
um

425
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,639
the other part is as well we have um

426
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,120
the layout now i didn't show i didn't

427
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,399
dictate the light a little bit but i

428
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,079
don't know i'll show you again in a bit

429
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,040
more detail it's a graded 6x6

430
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,399
and then

431
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,720
each one of those six things is a piece

432
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,519
of the facility for your base

433
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,320
however there are certain differences so

434
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
there is a sub pen which is where your

435
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,760
submarines live

436
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
that's split into four and it's the only

437
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,000
one that's different so

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,920
the the way that that works is you have

439
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,839
like the six by six grid

440
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,680
and then you can you can put in the six

441
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,040
by six grid

442
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,279
uh different uh values and then that

443
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,240
will show um once that's built it will

444
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,079
be in that grid reference

445
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,079
except for the sub pen which is uh top

446
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
left top right bottom left bottom right

447
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,399
yeah i did that right here yeah yeah um

448
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,680
so you have to be careful with that one

449
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,160
because it's four rather than the one so

450
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,079
each time you build something if you do

451
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,480
it through the uh the menu

452
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,519
um

453
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,480
it has a build time but we've written a

454
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,160
function i'll just clear that off so we

455
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,800
can just build something we run it

456
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
built already

457
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,399
and then the last part is the the

458
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,399
technicians and the scientists so as i

459
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,320
mentioned before the game of the game is

460
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,399
to

461
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,399
kill aliens capture aliens

462
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,839
research the technology find out what

463
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,360
they're doing find out where they are go

464
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,680
kill them right like like like like

465
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,920
every good sci-fi right find them and

466
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,240
kill them um

467
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,600
i mean they started i guess but

468
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,800
so

469
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,920
as you can see this is the structure i

470
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,560
was just talking about here um

471
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
at the top there those are all the areas

472
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,079
that i was talking about you recognize

473
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,040
them

474
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,279
and then the red part here

475
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,800
that's all the uh as i was saying that

476
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
the different quantities of the various

477
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,759
things

478
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,839
the blue and purple bits those are the

479
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,440
base layers i was saying about so the

480
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
first one though

481
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,759
in the turquoise i guess i'd call that

482
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,279
that's the layer of the facilities and

483
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,120
then the purple dark

484
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,880
the dark blue purple one

485
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,399
that's the time like the time amounts

486
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,160
and then the last two there is the uh

487
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,079
the scientists and the technicians so

488
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,680
you can only have 255 of those per base

489
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,199
but you don't really need 355

490
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,480
technicians when you can just drop

491
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,759
things into your inventory because then

492
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,360
you never have to build anything right

493
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,040
you can just go right i'll re-edit it

494
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
add that in done

495
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
scientists a little different

496
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,399
um last time i did this talk somebody

497
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,839
did ask me well why do you need

498
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,359
scientists if you can edit save file

499
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,720
can't you just mark all the research

500
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
done i'm like people where's the fun in

501
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,959
that

502
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,319
right

503
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,760
you gotta you gotta play a little bit

504
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,039
you can't just go right i'll go to the

505
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,679
end and end screen yeah after finished

506
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,039
you got a

507
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,240
bit of struggle in there i guess

508
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,720
there you go see so a bit more detail on

509
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,079
the uh the base

510
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,039
as you can see it's all uh

511
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,559
handily labeled the

512
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,520
double f is for the empty space in ufo

513
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,919
that's dirt in this is open ocean i

514
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,520
think it's uh if you hover over it it

515
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,480
says

516
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
and then as i mentioned before

517
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
you can see this one here has got a uh

518
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
build time on it so

519
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,720
the idea is you you start building you

520
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
wait it's not 12 real days though like

521
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,799
uh don't worry it's not easy you don't

522
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,480
have to wait real time

523
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,559
um

524
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,400
once you start the build you run the 12

525
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,559
days or whatever some things like 28

526
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,799
days as well actually quite a long time

527
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,120
and then it's built and then like there

528
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,960
are some things for example you need and

529
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,720
the end of every month

530
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
you have like uh one of the things you

531
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
have is like an mc lab it's for mind

532
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,440
control stuff

533
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
and at the end of every month you can

534
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,960
put your soldiers in training

535
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,480
if you if you've never played it i'm

536
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,320
explaining i guess a bit

537
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
and then every month you

538
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,640
have them in there and each month you

539
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,200
can see if they've improved or if not

540
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,799
you can kick them out put new ones in

541
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,120
stuff like that

542
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,919
right so as i said it takes 13 days to

543
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,919
build that one and if you look

544
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:34,799
just

545
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,960
there you can see

546
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,640
zero x 0d which is the hex number 13. um

547
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,559
so you can set that to zero and then

548
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,640
it'll be built

549
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,600
insta build like this

550
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,120
we might do that as a live demo in a

551
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,000
minute though but we're gonna wait till

552
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,400
the next live demo where god stingy

553
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,559
comes up

554
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,440
right

555
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,400
uh yeah okay okay

556
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
so as i said about the stores as well

557
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,559
the stores is actually 202 bytes long

558
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,200
but not all of that is valid data if you

559
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,760
start editing towards the end here you

560
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
start getting some garbled things in

561
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,880
your in your stores like it comes up

562
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,080
with like mission names and things like

563
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
that which you don't want so hopefully

564
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
when i did the stores sort of class

565
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,080
we only deal with with the valid stuff

566
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,919
so you can just uh you can create a

567
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,720
class of whatever the object is like so

568
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,160
if it's a topical launcher you just

569
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
create new topical launcher with a

570
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,360
quantity and then just drop it in

571
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
um

572
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
and then as i mentioned before we've got

573
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,679
the staff 255 is the max you ideally

574
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,679
probably want 250 because then you can

575
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,720
build labs out because each

576
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,919
each lab

577
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,679
can only handle 50 scientists so if when

578
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,880
you're building your baseline you need

579
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,039
to be mindful of that

580
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,400
so

581
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,520
five labs will be 250 and then you don't

582
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
have any sort of leftovers without doing

583
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
anything and they can they can research

584
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,799
things relatively quickly

585
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,960
so we're going to do another demo

586
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
live demo gods

587
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
again

588
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,200
this time we're gonna be editing some

589
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,679
code too

590
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,120
okay

591
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,480
how's everybody doing i'm i'm not

592
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,240
talking too fast i realize i talk quite

593
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,039
fast when i'm when i'm doing things

594
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,320
is everybody following that anybody

595
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,720
needs to go over anything you know

596
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,760
i mean i can i've got nowhere

597
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,880
although you guys might want to get like

598
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,240
a drink or something it's quite warm in

599
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,559
here

600
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,559
right so

601
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,200
what we're going to do is we're going to

602
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,559
sorry

603
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,520
oh

604
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,320
oh dear yeah

605
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,840
thank you very much

606
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,360
right you see that yeah there you go see

607
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,280
glad you're looking

608
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,640
so you can see

609
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
the name is uh

610
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,720
recognizable but wrong and then this is

611
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,240
this is the state

612
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,840
here is this that's the standard base

613
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,440
layout right so you've got three sub

614
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,280
pens facebook space

615
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,799
because you get two with that shoot the

616
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,559
submarine stand and one with disorders

617
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,480
integral picks the fault

618
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,520
so what we're going to do now

619
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,919
is we're going to

620
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,000
edit something i have to lean down while

621
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,799
i read this because it's very small

622
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,879
oh no that's the wrong button

623
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,619
[Music]

624
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
oh

625
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,559
vin

626
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,520
and then we edit it again

627
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,679
that didn't work did it

628
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,840
yep

629
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,439
it's python for you

630
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,480
it will be a live demo if nothing went

631
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,960
wrong with it

632
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,559
there we go right cool

633
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,520
so now we reload this save game right

634
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,520
here

635
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
and as you can see

636
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,720
we've changed the name it's no high

637
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,919
steel con

638
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,240
we have uh not built anything yet so

639
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,159
we'll do that in a minute but if we look

640
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,720
in our base information

641
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,120
we've now got 250 scientists i mean

642
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,880
they're doing nothing right now but what

643
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,919
what they're going to be doing in a

644
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,200
second it's researching things

645
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,559
so this is the research thing i was

646
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,760
talking about before so these are you

647
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,960
stand like so these are the things you

648
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
start off with researching

649
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,039
don't go with any of those

650
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,600
well i don't i never used them um

651
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,880
but we're going to drop some aliens and

652
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,000
bring them in a minute but we're going

653
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,360
to continue with the slideshow for a

654
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,760
second

655
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,919
again

656
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
yep

657
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,720
no

658
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,360
no no don't do that

659
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,360
oops

660
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,720
right

661
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
i'm back

662
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,120
[Music]

663
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,520
so yeah so as you saw we could edit the

664
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,600
the base data itself and it's fairly

665
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,440
easy to sort of recognize

666
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,520
how how we edited it

667
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,000
change the name and uh

668
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,840
drop some scientists in there

669
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
and they can research our things later

670
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,240
so the um

671
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,600
the next thing we're going to do is talk

672
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
about the aliens

673
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
now if you've ever played this game you

674
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,679
know that there are certain types of

675
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,960
hearings you'll experience on certain

676
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,120
missions some you'll only encounter

677
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,559
later in the game

678
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,559
uh here is a handy little guide of which

679
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,640
ones are valid uh this was if you were

680
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,960
using the hex editor then you could then

681
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,400
you would know which ones to do and then

682
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
you'd know what what to edit but because

683
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,960
we're super cool we've written a program

684
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,240
to do this so we don't need to do any of

685
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,919
that we can just

686
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,000
again create an object that's an alien

687
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
type dot

688
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,760
whatever the rank we need and if it's a

689
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,120
valid rank it will create that as a

690
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
valid rank and then you can just drop it

691
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,159
in

692
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,919
i'm not going to show a lot of the code

693
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,159
because again it's i'm trying to keep it

694
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,159
a little bit lighter on the technical

695
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,720
but it is on my i pushed it up to github

696
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,880
this week so if any of you are

697
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,080
interested in looking through and you

698
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
know maybe making some commits

699
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,600
you can get the report at the end

700
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,559
as i said

701
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,919
to get to the end you need to capture

702
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
live aliens you need to capture

703
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,120
particular ones in particular

704
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,799
high-ranking ones uh if you've ever

705
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,960
played this game lobstermen are the ones

706
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,480
that you have to capture and i can see

707
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,880
some grimaces when i mention lobster men

708
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,559
yep um

709
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,320
they're notoriously hard to kill they

710
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,960
take loads of loads of hits and then

711
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,640
even if you stun them they can wait back

712
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,720
up and kill you with melee which

713
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,880
not a lot of the aliens do

714
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
so when you get a mission with them

715
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,320
you're like oh dear

716
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
i better uh

717
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,799
better be careful here but we're taking

718
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,159
all that part i would like to do any of

719
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,919
that we can just drop them in

720
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,559
just regularly

721
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,799
which is what we're going to do now in

722
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,279
another live demo

723
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,559
i should have just kept it running but

724
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,400
like you can't mute these old games so

725
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
you know you can you probably won't be

726
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
able to hear me talking over that

727
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
because i actually gonna pick one isn't

728
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,279
it

729
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,360
don't worry i'll let you i'll let you

730
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,158
see that at the end

731
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,840
right so

732
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,039
as before we've edited our base our

733
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,640
money so what we're going to do now

734
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
we're going to drop some

735
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,960
extra facilities in there i'm going to

736
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,760
drop some aliens in there

737
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:29,520
[Music]

738
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,520
oh

739
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,039
[Music]

740
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,360
oh

741
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,039
[Music]

742
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,760
sorry about this

743
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,480
98

744
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,960
but you all hate watching people scroll

745
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,039
through called though yes it's fury

746
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,880
ah i was checking you're all watching

747
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,840
yeah

748
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,479
i'll get that right once i promise

749
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,120
right so now we've done a couple of

750
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,960
things uh as you can see i've i've left

751
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,720
debug statements in for the moment which

752
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,120
is what all of the uh these are

753
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,039
uh so that i know that it actually did

754
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,799
those things like it dropped the soldier

755
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,039
in they dropped that uh the lobster man

756
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,120
in and built the things

757
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,320
if we reload this now

758
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,039
you can see

759
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,399
we've got a cool

760
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,480
new alien containment facility there and

761
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
some some more labs here so our

762
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,919
scientists can do some work

763
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,000
on the aliens that we've now magically

764
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,200
captured

765
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,440
which show up in the uh the research

766
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,279
projects now so you can see here

767
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,080
you've got like a an aqua toy

768
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,399
navigator soldier a lobster man

769
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,880
commander a deep one terrorist

770
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,480
and a navigator

771
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,000
so those various different ranks and

772
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,480
races of different aliens so the deep

773
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
one terrorist

774
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,760
is a terrorist unit which you see on the

775
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,960
terrorist missions and the shipping

776
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,520
container missions excuse me

777
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,760
and you need those early in the game

778
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,159
because there's a bug in the actual game

779
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,240
where you get to a certain point you

780
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,080
can't research certain things anymore

781
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,240
one of those things is the armor and you

782
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,919
need to kill a deep one to get that

783
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,039
armor

784
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,720
so it's really useful to be able to drop

785
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,760
that in

786
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,880
straight away

787
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
and get it done before you reach the

788
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,159
point where you can't do it anymore and

789
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,200
then you have to start your whole game

790
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,480
again which

791
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,240
if you don't play this game it's a bit

792
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,720
annoying

793
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,640
right so yeah so basically i'll show you

794
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,320
how they

795
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,240
the research works right so we drop our

796
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,039
scientists in

797
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,960
back in the day you couldn't

798
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,200
they didn't know what a box was to type

799
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
so you had to you know you had to just

800
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,480
press and hold a button for 40 minutes

801
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,720
but that'll do 100 right so

802
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,279
as i say so look already uh with our 100

803
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,039
scientists we were really really quick

804
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,960
on the research there

805
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,039
and as i was mentioning before about the

806
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,960
different time scales

807
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,720
you can just click one day here like i

808
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,919
said you don't have to wait a real day

809
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,279
just click that

810
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,480
there you go

811
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,640
it changes one day to one second rather

812
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,480
than five seconds which is the default

813
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,559
and there we go here's our alien look at

814
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,279
him

815
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,520
big body there

816
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,679
but then that unlocks

817
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,200
different things for as you see so now

818
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,120
we have uh

819
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
alien origins as i was saying you gotta

820
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,200
interrogate aliens to make sure you know

821
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,960
you can you can tell what they're doing

822
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
within the mc lab

823
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,240
that was what i was talking about where

824
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,440
you build that and then you can train

825
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,760
your people in the mind control stuff um

826
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,120
what you don't want to do is not have

827
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,399
them trained when you get to layer

828
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,320
missions because the aliens have mind

829
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
control too

830
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,158
and they will kill you

831
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,000
[Music]

832
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,919
just save that so then we don't have to

833
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,679
research that again because we already

834
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,000
did it

835
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
again

836
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,200
i know it says dos but it's a mac so

837
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,320
it's not really dos

838
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,960
right and then we

839
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,440
all right so yeah

840
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,559
so what next so that's basically the the

841
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,559
ins and outs of the

842
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,519
uh the process of of designing the uh

843
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,360
the serial editor had a couple of issues

844
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,799
with things like

845
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,399
writing back to once i'd read out the

846
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,559
file and converted into an editable

847
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,679
format

848
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,399
namely uh integers because each of them

849
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,559
is 250 what zero to two five five

850
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,960
because there are bytes

851
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,799
basically just replace those bytes with

852
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,000
different bytes and then when i try to

853
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,279
write it back there's a lot of times

854
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,559
where it's like oh no you can't do that

855
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,559
because that was you've done something

856
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,320
wrong but then you have to look through

857
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,760
the actual file that you've saved

858
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
because you're like where is it wrong so

859
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,679
you'd have like for example

860
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,039
for the

861
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,720
the where did the bases because it's a

862
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,919
6x6 grid it split it up into a list of

863
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,240
six um

864
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
lines of six obviously so when i tried

865
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,760
to write it back one of the problems i

866
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,640
had was right in the index as well

867
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,279
so i had instead of it going across in

868
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,039
lines it went

869
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,279
one and then the six bytes and then two

870
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,880
and then the six bytes but you couldn't

871
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,480
really see it without having them side

872
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,840
by side and it was

873
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,679
it was it was a bit of a pain to debug

874
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,720
because

875
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,640
on the one hand they've got

876
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
a mess of binary characters and on the

877
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,039
other hand i've got a different

878
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,960
messenger characters i'm going across

879
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,120
counting where this one should be 36

880
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,799
and getting to like 30 and then losing

881
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,279
count and to go back in it's a nightmare

882
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,799
um

883
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,960
but yeah um i said i tried to keep a

884
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,279
little bit light on the actual technical

885
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,200
sort of deep dive

886
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,760
pun intended um

887
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,960
but uh

888
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,039
if you guys want to check it out it is

889
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,039
on github uh

890
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,240
maybe you can get yourself a new

891
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,840
hacktoberfest t-shirt this year yeah

892
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,200
i'll i'll okay your pull requests if you

893
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,960
want yeah

894
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,519
um yeah um

895
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,799
i want to do some refactoring because

896
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,840
there's some things i'm not happy with

897
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,279
but i thought

898
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,960
you know perfect is the enemy of

899
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
complete and

900
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,720
at a limited time to get this done

901
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,320
because i decided oh i'm gonna write the

902
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,399
actual editor this time and

903
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,960
did that in maybe two weeks i'm not

904
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,120
bragging it was a bad idea

905
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,960
but if you had any of you been to uni i

906
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,640
mean i'm sure you went i went to school

907
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,600
and you're like your homework to the

908
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,799
last minute

909
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,120
i still do it now um

910
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,480
the other thing i want to do obviously

911
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,120
is

912
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,200
see how i uh ask you that right because

913
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,760
what's the ci tool without asking

914
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,039
it might as well not even have like a

915
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,200
name like a you know cool vulnerability

916
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,880
name or something i'll probably do that

917
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,320
in rich or rather than try and use uh

918
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,420
like uh tkinter to do some

919
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,600
[Music]

920
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,440
i hate you can tell

921
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,039
if any of you ever worked with it to try

922
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,720
and write guise in python it's awful

923
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,320
most people what they do instead is they

924
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
write their app as an api

925
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,480
and then you use flask or something to

926
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,200
write a web front end for a desktop app

927
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,960
you know because

928
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,840
it's just garbage but

929
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,919
yeah oh

930
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,279
so these are the some references

931
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,120
obviously if uh if you want to buy this

932
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,480
game i think i was talking to a couple

933
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
of people at the pub last night this

934
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,360
game is only 10 pounds on steam

935
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,440
in the pack

936
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,760
there's like uh the first two

937
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,399
apocalypse which is all right as well uh

938
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,760
we don't talk about interceptor

939
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,079
reinforces all those were absolute hot

940
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,480
garbage

941
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,000
but enforcer was a first person shooter

942
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,679
which you know if you

943
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,760
ever played an rts game

944
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,520
it's not really first person

945
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,839
i'll shoot it um

946
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,440
but at the time everybody was doing

947
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,800
shooters and it was dead popular so

948
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,239
let's get on let's let's get on let's do

949
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,359
one right and

950
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,399
it was awful

951
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,440
um

952
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,199
but yeah

953
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,800
so my github

954
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,480
is

955
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,440
there and some socials and things

956
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,040
and i'll tell you what now i will let

957
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,399
you see

961
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,839
no no i've completely lost where it

962
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,359
is promise this isn't my first time

963
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,799
using a computer it may look like

964
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,160
here we go you're ready for this

965
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,200
right in the middle of the screen

966
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,119
i'll move the mouse so i can enjoy it

967
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,480
and i'll take questions after this as

968
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,300

oh yeah uh well thank you for sort of

987
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
being very patient with me and uh

988
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,640
listening now does anybody have any

989
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,400
questions

990
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,440
yeah how long did it taste

991
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,440
well not answer that one uh it was a

992
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,800
while

993
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,720
uh basically i just put music on and you

994
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,000
know you know what you can just zoom out

995
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,520
it was like it's quite once i got into

996
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,680
it's quite soothing you know oh sorry

997
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,880
but the question was how long did it

998
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,040
take to to diff it right i forgot i had

999
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,880
to do that don't worry further

1000
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,760
um

1001
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,680
yeah it was a while um

1002
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,480
but then once i got most of it done i

1003
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,839
kind of knew where things were and i was

1004
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,599
like right well these are this finally

1005
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,960
focused on the three things because

1006
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,440
there are other things that i

1007
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,040
maybe might add in later like for

1008
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,440
example uh you can edit the soldiers

1009
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,800
data now i don't know if you've ever

1010
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
played the game and

1011
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,920
but one of the things you can edit is

1012
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
their accuracy because if you've ever

1013
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,839
played it you know they are very very

1014
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,400
inaccurate especially when you need them

1015
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
to shoot something which i mean

1016
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,960
obviously is when they're gonna be

1017
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,320
you're gonna need the accuracy right but

1018
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
if if you come up and there's like three

1019
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,680
aliens like i better get one of these

1020
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,400
otherwise i'm dead you're missing

1021
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,880
there's a problem because everything's

1022
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,280
you know old and nothing was checked

1023
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,079
properly what can happen is if you edit

1024
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,920
the set accuracy for example to be a

1025
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,280
hundred percent

1026
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,200
and they get an accurate accuracy bonus

1027
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,680
it'll overflow and then they will miss

1028
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,280
everything

1029
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,880
because they will have negative percent

1030
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,839
accuracy so like there's a few things

1031
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,440
that left for me to do

1032
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,119
as well as some refactor work as i said

1033
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,440
i'm not happy with exactly how it is but

1034
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
you know sometimes you've got to draw a

1035
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,320
line and stand and go that's version one

1036
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,160
everything else is scope creep

1037
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,680
um

1038
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,079
i want to check so when i'm doing when

1039
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,640
the build comes on and you basically uh

1040
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,920
you can like i said like with the sub

1041
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,079
pen because it's four

1042
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,000
i want to check that i'm not building

1043
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,760
over something else

1044
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,040
and if i am i want it to come back and

1045
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,359
say no we can't or do you want to

1046
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,440
because this is going to go

1047
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,280
and i want to make a pretty little tui

1048
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,800
like i said i might use rich for that

1049
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,640
because you can do emojis and then i can

1050
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
have a little box with the alien like

1051
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,640
emoji at the top and you can see nobody

1052
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,079
cool maybe i'll do that again there's

1053
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,720
another talk but who knows

1054
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,640
any other questions

1055
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,599
yeah

1056
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,079
you mentioned that there was some armor

1057
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,599
that after a certain amount of time

1058
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,280
playing the game you could no longer

1059
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,720
unlock did you

1060
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,839
get anywhere

1061
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
uh so the question was um

1062
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,359
based on a bug about the armor uh after

1063
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,720
a certain point you can't unlock it

1064
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,280
anymore um is there a way you can like

1065
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,359
reverse that and patch that out i didn't

1066
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,079
research that yet because um this was

1067
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,480
more about the i because i want to play

1068
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,880
the game and win before i start fixing

1069
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,000
it right

1070
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,599
uh because i mean it is a 30 year old

1071
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,200
game and you know i know we're all used

1072
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,040
to working on legacy systems and you

1073
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,880
know cobbling around the monkey patch

1074
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,240
and things like that

1075
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,440
but um

1076
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,520
no the answer is no not yet but maybe

1077
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,359
later

1078
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,000
anybody else

1079
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,359
well mother thank you very much

1080
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,960
i guess you can all uh

1081
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
escape and go get a drink because it's

1082
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,720
very hot in here isn't it there's no i

1083
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,400
don't the air condon or anything like

1084
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,000
that and i hope you all enjoyed it and

1085
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,400
thank you for coming
