00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,440
so i'm not going to tell you how to use

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
a treadmill but what i'm going to show

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,399
you is

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,559
what else you can do with your treadmill

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,120
so that's a good thing

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,000
so

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,239
who am i i'm soroush i work at mdsec as

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,239
a research slash pentastic

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,399
web app tester basically if you want to

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,520
call it web app security ninja

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,640
and pen tester and so i build tools as

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
well mostly i build tools to break other

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,200
people's tools because i'm a tool

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
as they call it

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,680
i am calling myself a tired lazy bug

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,360
bounty hunter and the reason for this is

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
like for automation you have to put a

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
lot of efforts there and uh i just like

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,040
to use burp suit manually and i find no

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
bugs and that's why i'm like i'm a i

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,000
should call myself a retired bounty

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
hunters that that is because i'm not

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
earning any money from it

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
so that's fine and i have lots of

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
teachers from different security

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
conferences as many of you have and

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,799
because of the lockdown i did not

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
receive a lot of t-shirts in the past

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
two years so most of them have holes in

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
them that's why i call them holy

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,119
t-shirts

49
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
and so the guy over there is pit of

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,520
interest made if you're disturbed by

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,600
that uh basically uh pitmojis just close

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,399
your eyes uh but i really like it so i'm

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,119
going to use pidmoji's uh in all my

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,280
slides this is what we use in mdsec as

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,399
well to

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,758
basically express ourselves so i thought

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,000
maybe i should give you basically a feel

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
of like what i'm going to talk about and

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,520
what the slides are about using uh his

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,879
face

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,160
so what am i doing with a treadmill i'm

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,720
a web app tester and

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,959
i'm basically i don't like gym or

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,800
anything what am i doing with it so

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,959
lockdown happened kovit came and

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,480
everybody was like

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,959
mental health matters

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,440
you should go for i don't know do stuff

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
with yourself

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,680
because you can't go out and walk like i

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,760
normally work remotely and i sit in

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,239
front of my computer all the day and i

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,879
don't do much but then lockdown happened

74
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,560
and they said you can't go out of your

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,959
house i was really really upset about it

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,680
i was like i want to go out now that you

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,599
are removing this option i want to go

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,120
out so i was like i need to be fit i

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,599
know i wasn't fit before kovit but i'm

80
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,000
like hov maybe i should get fit maybe

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
that's good for me so and everybody was

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
buying this treadmill you know everybody

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,159
was like after toilet papers and

84
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,000
treadmills and things like that so i was

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
like probably need to get one because

86
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
it's going to be very valuable in the

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,000
future the price is going to go up i'm

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
going to get rich and at the same time

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,319
i'm going to get fit so that's that's

90
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,319
the challenge the only problem was i

91
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,560
couldn't find any threat meals online so

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
any good threatenings i would say i

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,400
found one in amazon i bought it like it

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,720
had a discount and it broke on the first

95
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
day when i fell on it

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,519
and i was like why did i fall fell like

97
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
why did i fall on it it was like the

98
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,720
shortest there was like i was not

99
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,840
running

100
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
i was just walking on it trying to see

101
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,560
how robust it is it was like

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,599
it broke

103
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
and i was like okay i'm not going to use

104
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,000
this so i returned it i mean that i i

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,840

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,840
went shopping and shopping therapy helps

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,640
like working out and looking for

110
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
treadmills all the day online and

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,360
pretending that you're busy good

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,480
yeah and

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,519
basically excuses to just buy so

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,200
what kind of treatment should you choose

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,280
when you want to buy a treadmill the

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,199
treadmill first of all should be a good

117
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,639
brand because you want to show it off to

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,560
your friends you you don't just buy any

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
treadmills and put it in your house and

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,880
just

121
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,639
like you don't just buy a very cheap

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,080
amazon basic treadmill and put it in

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,759
your house and you want to show it when

124
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,759
you want to show off you just you just

125
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,199
want to tell everybody that you have a

126
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
treadmill so it needs to be stylish you

127
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
need to go with your furniture you want

128
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,880
a treadmill that you can put next to

129
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,680
your sofa and next to your bed or

130
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
whatever wherever you have space for

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
like for me i only have a space in my

132
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,040
study room

133
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
behind my computer so i was like yeah

134
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,840
this is a good place i need a stylish uh

135
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
treadmill and my treadmill needed to be

136
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,600
connected to the internet and the reason

137
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
for that was because i wanted to watch

138
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,800
movies while i'm on it because i will

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,080
get word i'm like if i wasn't maybe the

140
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,479
reason i did never use gym or treatments

141
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,560
in the gym and things like that

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,440
was because i was bored maybe if i watch

143
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,759
movies when i'm basically running or

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
walking on a treadmill it will help i

145
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,560
was like i need netflix and amazon prime

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,639
and disney plus and things like that so

147
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,240
i went online

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,039
and looked for it yeah and also um i was

149
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,720
like

150
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,639
the treadmill needs to hold my food

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,280
because if a treadmill can't hold food

152
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,759
like what kind of treadmill is that like

153
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,120
i want to eat my mcdonald's with my coke

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
next to it when i'm on a treadmill

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
because let's face it mental health

156
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
matters

157
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,800
and uh yeah so

158
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,039
you know you guys are cool but if you

159
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,360
want to be cooler on the treadmill you

160
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
need a fun the treadmill needs to have a

161
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
fan the fan shouldn't be noisy because

162
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
then you can't hear the movie but yeah i

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
mean it needs to have a fan and then

164
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,160
some other features like it needs to

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
run and work and stuff

166
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,479
so i was like recently i actually used

167
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,840
this as well at the time it wasn't

168
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,520
available but like what does an ai think

169
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,840
about a treadmill that has all these

170
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,039
features so i'm going to ask crayon i

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,520
mean the dolly the the next version of

172
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
dolly to basically give me the photo and

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,919
he gave me the photo and

174
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,840
and guess what it actually one of these

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
photos is actually my treadmill so i was

176
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,080
right i was like i i'm exactly

177
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,680
in love with this uh ai because it

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,759
thinks like me and look at that guy with

179
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,000
the pizza on a treadmill that's not me

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
because that guy is running i walk

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
so i introduce you to this fancy reebok

182
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
treadmill

183
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,039
very expensive currently has an offer in

184
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,520
argos i think and i got it from argus

185
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
because it wasn't available anywhere in

186
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
the internet and argus normally sells

187
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,919
threatens very expensively if you find

188
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,160
it somewhere else it will be cheaper but

189
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
it had good reviews everybody was happy

190
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,919
about it and guess what it had netflix

191
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,520
so i bought it

192
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,400
and i was like home gonna use it how

193
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
hard can it be it's like a treadmill i

194
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
just use my natural instincts i mean i

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
use my natural instincts all the time in

196
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,080
my life it this happened so oh that's a

197
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,160
treadmill i'll just go on it around and

198
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,880
i will watch movies and that's it

199
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
so

200
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,639
i bought expensive shoes and clothes and

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,080
everything that goes with the treadmill

202
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,440
because you know you can't just use your

203
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
normal shoes on a treadmill especially a

204
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,759
treadmill that is in the house i'm like

205
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,680
hygiene matters as well it's covered

206
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,160
time so i need to have my own pair of

207
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,479
shoes for a treadmill clothes for the

208
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,840
treadmill

209
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
something to dry my face when i'm in a

210
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,919
treadmill if i'm on a treadmill and

211
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,160
guess what um

212
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
indeed i got all those yes shopping

213
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,000
therapy

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
and then during the year i realized that

215
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,720
i only used my treadmill once

216
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,879
but it was stylish

217
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
so but i needed to do something about it

218
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
i was like i need to motivate myself or

219
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,080
i need to find out how i can use my

220
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,720
treadmill so i'm going to represent you

221
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
some other ways of using your treadmill

222
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,759
to actually make your thread more useful

223
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,680
so i started using it as a bed i was

224
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,080
like a treadmill can be good maybe if i

225
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,479
sleep on it look at my fancy shoes over

226
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,400
there and stuff

227
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,680
and also if i sleep on it then uh it's

228
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,120
good for working from home especially

229
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,280
because it's just behind my computer my

230
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,159
desk and i can just sleep there but then

231
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,719
it wasn't comfy enough it was short

232
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,039
like i was like ooh that's like this no

233
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,320
i didn't like it

234
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
although we use it like a den just sit

235
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,559
there and think about the future and

236
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,800
drink my coffee and but then i couldn't

237
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,320
use my laptop there in the den so no

238
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,160
and then i was like it can be a cave you

239
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,000
can play hide and seek with my uh

240
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,040
daughter and uh yeah it was good first

241
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,560
but then she realized that i'm always

242
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,839
hiding there so

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,640
no that that wasn't good anymore

244
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,399
so i used it like a storage i was like i

245
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,200
will put my boxes on it so every time i

246
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
want anything they're just behind me

247
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,279
i'll just put my hands in and get the

248
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,480
cable out

249
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
they're mostly full of rubbish and

250
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,040
cables and uh old freebies from

251
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
conferences then i used to go and some

252
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,000
iot stuff here

253
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,279
but then the problem was i couldn't

254
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,920
access these boxes so yeah they're

255
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,240
underneath and it was difficult to move

256
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
them and i'm tired i'm like this is not

257
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,680
the way

258
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
and then i was like it can be a coat

259
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,480
hanger i can just put my clothes on it

260
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,640
my room is going to get tidier it's

261
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,720
going to be good we have a winner guys

262
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,800
we have a winner the only problem at

263
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
this point was it was just too expensive

264
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
to be a coat hanger

265
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,120
so we need to resolve that issue we will

266
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,920
see how i resolved that issue so now

267
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
from now on we are just going to see

268
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
what's going to happen but then

269
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,160
i'm in a path to motivate myself so i

270
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
need to find something

271
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,040
and

272
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
i was like i'll just watch movies on it

273
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
and the netflix will start crashing on

274
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,040
the damn treadmill i was like this is

275
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
not the way i just wanted to use this

276
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,120
treadmill for once and then i realized

277
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,640
it doesn't have disney plus for me to

278
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,760
watch frozen

279
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,399
the marbles and stuff

280
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
and yeah so i was like i need to do

281
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,519
something on it and i can't update it

282
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,200
there is this update button and it was

283
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
very laggy when i was tapping on the

284
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,240
treadmill it was just

285
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,519
not doing the stuff i wanted to do so

286
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,000
the lag looked like android

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
sorry guys that you have android but

288
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,240
yeah android most of times becomes slow

289
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,399
after some time it reminded me my htc

290
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,959
phone like when i was like dragging

291
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,959
and didn't work and then suddenly

292
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,959
everything happened and i was like yeah

293
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,920
that's that's weird so i was like i need

294
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
to find this update button in the menu

295
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
so i went there checked all the menus

296
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,120
especially the apps and movies

297
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,680
and i never clicked on these to be

298
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,760
honest you don't know what they do

299
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,920
but but yeah but

300
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,880
i normally just click on these and tap

301
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,040
on these and there is a button there

302
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,959
start and i press that start button and

303
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,200
then it has like these buttons on the

304
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,959
handle so i don't need to use these i

305
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,839
don't know what they do

306
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,600
probably uh but then i found this menu

307
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,839
here other settings i was like that's it

308
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,920
i've just updated how hard can it be i

309
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
will install this in plus on the tip

310
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,800
and then it said no pass and then just

311
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,480
said include your password i had no

312
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
password i was like for the first time

313
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,560
ever i need to look at the manual

314
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,720
so i i was like okay

315
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,000
that this one i need to look at the

316
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
manual i looked at the manual password

317
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,200
wasn't there not even a mention of this

318
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,680
menu anywhere so go online default

319
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,040
password hard candy so i searched online

320
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,640
uh over and over and everybody was

321
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,880
looking at looking at it and everybody

322
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
was looking for this password nobody had

323
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,279
the password i was like okay they don't

324
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,120
have the password here they don't have

325
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,519
the password in the reviews and i was

326
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,680
like i need to i need this password at

327
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,079
this time i was motivated

328
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,079
this is how i was i became motivated i

329
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,639
was like something has a password and i

330
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,600
don't have it and i need to have it

331
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,639
so i was like how hard can it be it has

332
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,600
google chrome i'm a web tester i know

333
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,680
web i know google chrome so i can just

334
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,600
use it so i went to google chrome i

335
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,920
started going to through the directories

336
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,000
of android i realized

337
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,320
it's android actually at that time and

338
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,240
then also i will just perform an

339
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,680
environment breakout so normally in an

340
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
environment breakout you have like a

341
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,519
kiosk or something for example in the

342
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,440
airport that tells you to pay money you

343
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,639
don't want to pay money or you want to

344
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,240
pay less money and you still want to use

345
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,519
it or you want to get a shell on it

346
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,519
you're just an atm bank

347
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,920
not that bad so you want to do a

348
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,600
breakout so

349
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
you basically use the tools that you

350
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,839
have and because google chrome was there

351
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,000
so this is the easiest tool i can use it

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
even had a usb drive i could browse to

353
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,839
the usb drive put files on it and

354
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
execute them probably

355
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,440
never try that because copying

356
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
forwarding a file in the usb and i'm i'm

357
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
not that

358
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
motivated yet

359
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,320
so as i i just use this browser to break

360
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,519
out so

361
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,120
what i did

362
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,399
was

363
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,720
i basically went to the google play and

364
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
i was like okay

365
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
now i want to install the ssh server on

366
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,200
it and then disappeared here opening

367
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,040
play store app and guess what i tapped

368
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
on it and play store open but i could

369
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,200
just go here and tap on that and say

370
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
about and that would have appeared as

371
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
well but i didn't know that at the time

372
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,399
i basically didn't try it but then i

373
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
went there and installed ssh server and

374
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,600
i was like okay now i can find the

375
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,639
password

376
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,040
maybe if i association into the box and

377
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,959
see what it has

378
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,360
i can uh basically get a password out of

379
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,600
it so i the only thing i needed to do

380
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
was to create a google account

381
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,079
there for the treadmill and to install

382
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,839
it after it was installed i was like

383
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,880
okay i need good route so i typed

384
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,279
sue and i became root it was a pretty

385
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,399
rooted device so so i tried like

386
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,480
think about it the treadmill

387
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,560
hard work but so far

388
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,000
it's been easy

389
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,279
so easy you just you just go there you

390
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,760
you basically tops you you install the

391
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,560
app

392
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,399
it's like playing with your mobile phone

393
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,560
and then you get shell access to the box

394
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
and then your root and you you see stuff

395
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,959
around you can control the treadmill you

396
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,120
can immediately stop it

397
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,639
you can start in speed 20 or something

398
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,160
and then i had the apk file for the

399
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,399
actually the app that was running on the

400
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,199
treadmill it was an android device so

401
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,600
i looked at the apk file and i

402
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,399
decompiled it and the password was there

403
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,000
i was like i got it i got the password

404
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,800
i can just log into the menu

405
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
and i search basically the password via

406
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,480
the thread mail nothing appeared in

407
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,399
google or vedu

408
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,920
i really try to type this i'm good

409
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,480
and now i just use translator

410
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
and then i logged in

411
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,079
and this was the menu so i was like oh

412
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,399
android setting app information

413
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
traditional information guess what it

414
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,079
was only good for when you wanted to

415
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,480
basically service the treadmill the the

416
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
android was old the android version was

417
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,760
five one one uh i couldn't upgrade it i

418
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,440
couldn't do anything with it it didn't

419
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,240
have uh like it wasn't it was up to date

420
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
basically i would say and that menu was

421
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
only good if you wanted to basically

422
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,880
change the oil or force the treadmill to

423
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,399
do something and things like that i was

424
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,759
like i'm not interested but i'm

425
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
interested to read that app now that i'm

426
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,480
there i just want to see more i want to

427
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,120
see what else it is doing um does it

428
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,959
communicate with any service can i

429
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,040
basically ask the server to update me

430
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,519
and then basically i found out that

431
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
actually it communicates with the server

432
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
with an ip address and a port number

433
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,920
over http and not even https

434
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,079
and from now on i'm going to call this

435
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,000
the control server

436
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,199
so

437
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,000
okay

438
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,079
so from now on it's about application

439
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,719
assessment

440
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,440
and then

441
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,600
back in front of my pc rather than on

442
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,959
the treadmill so uh it was good so i was

443
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,720
like i need to look at this see what it

444
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,279
does i i have no idea what it does

445
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,079
and then look at that it actually it it

446
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,880
sends something to the uh a bash file

447
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,279
and then it has like a reebok version

448
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,240
something

449
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
okay shell

450
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
shell is very good i like shell

451
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,959
and i went there and basically series in

452
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,000
china

453
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,079
there is no surprise in that so i kind

454
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,720
of like could guess that um

455
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
directory listing was enabled on all the

456
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,320
full days the basically i was good i

457
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
didn't have any admin interface and

458
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,160
everything was accessible to me and i

459
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
didn't need to bypass anything it was

460
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,399
surprisingly it was windows box

461
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,320
it was a windows box running linux

462
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,519
commands

463
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
i like that idea because it was like

464
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,079
what is this and then apk were

465
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,920
downloaded from the server not from the

466
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,800
google play store unencrypted from that

467
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,199
server and basically i realized that if

468
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,439
i control this server i control all the

469
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,599
treadmills that are the same brand

470
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,400
around the world and i will be god of

471
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,959
the treadmill and then i can tell people

472
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,880
what to do with the treadmill like

473
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,039
especially if boris johnson is on it i

474
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,720
can just say go faster

475
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,679
you fat

476
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,919
just like me

477
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,200
but for me i will be just like no

478
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,799
so yeah so what was that in that uh in

479
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,320
on the server so i'm just showing you

480
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,440
one of these folders for example and uh

481
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,280
i've tried to hide the defined names

482
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,919
because obviously you don't need them uh

483
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,360
and there was

484
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,679
like this for the cgi dashbin for those

485
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,080
who know about it like normally they put

486
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,400
stuff that they want to run and uh

487
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,880
execute or important stuff in that

488
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,559
folder and you shouldn't have access to

489
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,120
it but i had access to it

490
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,679
these uh bash files here the shell the

491
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,520
bash files over there whenever i was

492
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
calling them they were not giving me the

493
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,880
source code they were being executed on

494
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840
the server wasn't fascinating if i can

495
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,320
write a file in that folder i get remote

496
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,160
code execution immediately on the server

497
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
so that was good and then i found like

498
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
what are these text files and db files

499
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,240
and i was like what is that what's

500
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,520
happening here

501
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,679
so i pulled out one of these um

502
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,039
text files basically reebok statistics

503
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,600
yes i found my mac address there my ip

504
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,760
address there the time that i use my

505
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,919
treadmill and stuff

506
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,600
and there are some files with actual

507
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,520
physical location of people

508
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,200
i don't know what

509
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,280
what device it was it was another brand

510
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,360
but this basically

511
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
server was a controller for many

512
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,720
treadmills

513
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,799
it wasn't just for this ribbon i still

514
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,320
don't know what they are

515
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,280
somewhere in the world but they it had

516
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,240
like information of all the users not

517
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,799
with their personal names but just

518
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,600
physical location and ip address and mac

519
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,679
address and stuff like that

520
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,440
and i could probably locate something

521
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,280
maybe if i wanted in number 10

522
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,559
but no i didn't

523
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,880
number 10 downing street no i didn't i

524
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,440
never did that i did not look for it but

525
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,919
basically at this point i was like okay

526
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,440
i never gave this application my consent

527
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,240
to collect my information i never gave

528
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,280
this application anything to say i'm

529
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,600
happy for you to be connected to your

530
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,320
server i don't want it to be connected

531
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
to server and collect my information

532
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
because who knows maybe it's collecting

533
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,919
something else somewhere else

534
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,440
um actually

535
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,039
at that point i was like i need to read

536
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,799
the source guide looked around and i

537
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,880
realized that no this is this is this is

538
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,600
the way it actually logged data in that

539
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
folder so there are other files there as

540
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000
well and db file database files and it

541
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,120
was logging everything in all those

542
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,320
and this is the way it was basically

543
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,679
sending this

544
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,960
to the server was sending the stats in

545
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
some parameters in the url

546
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,919
and

547
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,760
then i was like what would happen if i

548
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,159
mess with these parameters so i

549
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,799
basically put foo bar in them and send

550
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,960
it to the server and it created this

551
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,400
full dot bar

552
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
underscore statistics.txt on the server

553
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,760
so it's fascinating so a file right on

554
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,000
that folder i just need to create a bash

555
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
file to have my command execution on the

556
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,600
server and prove the point that the

557
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,320
services is insecure and i need to block

558
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,080
it on my router

559
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
yeah that was the only point i just

560
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
wanted to to know if i need to block it

561
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,039
or not you know

562
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,600
and then i was like okay i will use ntfs

563
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,080
alternate data stream i added these

564
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,320
column characters after this uh full bar

565
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,240
when it creates the file instead of

566
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,679
creating foobar

567
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,600
footage bar underscore statistics just

568
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,039
creates food up borrowing service so at

569
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,960
this point i could just create foo dot

570
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,200
sh on the server content was empty but

571
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,799
that was fine because it was a windows

572
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,360
server i could probably just use short

573
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,640
names or some tricks like that and then

574
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,760
come up with some way of putting stats

575
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,120
in the file

576
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,080
so that wouldn't be hard but still i

577
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,600
need to try

578
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
a lot harder than it should have so i

579
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,080
was like

580
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,760
this is

581
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,799
a bash file here this is it's a shell he

582
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,120
said it it's something

583
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,799
so what would happen if i do a classic

584
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,360
uh command injection

585
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,440
first before trying to do anything with

586
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,840
the file so i did this like i used this

587
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,480
backtick here and a backtick there the

588
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,559
backtick here and the backpick there

589
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,960
it's not like that and then yeah it

590
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,880
actually executed the command on the

591
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,400
server

592
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
referred code execution

593
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,559
i got you now i need to block this

594
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,720
server but wait

595
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,799
it was vulnerable to shell shark because

596
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,360
it was it was bash and it was shell it

597
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,960
was on windows and i was like wow we are

598
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
in 2000 and i don't know at that point

599
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,679
21.

600
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,400
21 at december look

601
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,039
i had so much christmas spirit at that

602
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,320
time

603
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,840
so

604
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,919
i was like okay

605
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,320
i will just exploit this and i will move

606
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,480
on with my christmas stuff

607
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
so i exploited it and it worked and i

608
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,720
was like these are so insecure i can

609
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,480
control everything

610
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
but then i was like okay let's get the

611
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,760
information of this server because i

612
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,960
need to know what the server is

613
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,320
fascinating

614
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,200
and

615
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,039
so i got the system information it was

616
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,480
windows 7

617
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,640
so basically the server

618
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
was a windows 7

619
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,799
running linux commands

620
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,520
i was like this is so good this is like

621
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
dream come true and it was outdated and

622
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,039
everything but my commands were running

623
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,840
as a system so didn't matter

624
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,480
and then i realized that they have like

625
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,360
this sig vin installed in the center

626
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
found you how you run

627
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
basically shell and stuff and you

628
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,320
understand ls and all those sort of

629
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,799
things linux things

630
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,679
and

631
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,559
then i looked at the web server and the

632
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,720
web server was like this light http 1 49

633
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,200
and the last time it was updated

634
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,559
it was basically 2011. and that's why

635
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,919
basically it was vulnerable to

636
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,480
everything because they never updated it

637
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,240
that's why it was it's still vulnerable

638
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
to shell shock if someone used this on

639
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,919
windows they never updated another

640
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,760
version of it for windows and the guys

641
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
were just like

642
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,400
yeah we have a windows 7 but i'm only

643
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,559
good with linux let's just install this

644
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,039
on windows and then make it looks like

645
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,440
linux but it's actually windows so yeah

646
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,840
that's why it happened

647
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,520
and then i realized that there are other

648
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,919
things on that server if dp was there

649
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,760
very outdated vulnerable to a lot of

650
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
things i did not exploit them because

651
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,360
they didn't need to anymore and then

652
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,440
there was this outdated application for

653
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,679
customer service if someone can read it

654
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,039
probably it says customer service

655
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,000
somewhere

656
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,159
i didn't try uh to break this because at

657
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,720
this point i was like i wasn't sure if i

658
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,880
am basically on that control server or

659
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,480
not

660
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
if you ask you may ask later did i have

661
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,679
permission to do all these things they

662
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,440
had bug bounty program

663
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,720
i mean adidas had blocked by

664
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,919
anti-programmer

665
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,919
reebok is part of adidas so i was like

666
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,440
if i do this i may be able to basically

667
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
get bounty but because this wasn't part

668
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,679
of uh

669
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,440
adidas from my point of view i was like

670
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,640
i'm not going to do anything i'm just

671
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,520
going to tell them this is too old

672
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,159
last update 2012.

673
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,159
i was like any more things on the

674
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,720
treadmill before i block the ip address

675
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,360
oh yeah so there were more files on that

676
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,679
server disclosing sensitive data all

677
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,760
sort of things and there were some

678
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
pre-installed hidden chinese apps on the

679
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,200
treadmill as well like i was just

680
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
looking at

681
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
the the apps that were installed on the

682
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,840
android device on the treadmill there

683
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
were some chinese apps that i

684
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,440
never knew what they are but probably

685
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
useful

686
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
but then i installed them i was like i

687
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
don't want this i uninstalled them and

688
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,080
you know what whenever you update it

689
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,120
actually install all of them back so i

690
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,520
blocked the ip address of the rotor

691
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,559
nozzle at this point

692
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,880
i just use my treadmill like a normal

693
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,400
human being

694
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,919
but before that i need to report the

695
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,520
vulnerabilities i need to report them to

696
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,840
adidas so adidas also has this uh t19x

697
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,159
treadmill the interface is exactly the

698
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,200
same as this so basically it runs the

699
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,360
same operating system and i found it out

700
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
because the stats the server and i could

701
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,000
basically get all the information out of

702
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,960
it uh obviously adidas has a private

703
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,240
bug bounty program i knew about it

704
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
guess what i wasn't part of it

705
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,039
i was i used these vulnerabilities as

706
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,760
like please invite me to your program

707
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,159
because i'm good see i will report all

708
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,400
of i actually reported all of them via

709
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,159
email to adidas and i was like i'm using

710
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,080
this treadmill i want it to be secure

711
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
but it's like a back door in my house

712
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,440
and i'm not part of your bug bounty

713
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
program please and then they basically

714
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,080
said we will invite you to our blog

715
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,159
bounty program then i had lots of

716
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,919
problems to be invited that bug bounty

717
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,360
programs it took them a month to

718
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,120
basically invite me properly first they

719
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,400
invited me to

720
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,600
um

721
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
something for uh i think it was for luck

722
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,640
for jay

723
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,919
some sort of thing they made a mistake

724
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,080
there and but guess what because it was

725
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,000
during the christmas time

726
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,679
everybody was like

727
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,200
do we just want to go on holiday we

728
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,799
don't want to do this and that's why i

729
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,760
wasn't really fast so uh that was good

730
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,200
but then in the end of the day they

731
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
fixed all those bugs and missed

732
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,039
configurations they actually used a

733
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,600
proper linux box in the end engine x

734
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,720
everything was fine so that was good and

735
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,799
they gave me four thousand dollar

736
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,080
for for the ford uh basically all those

737
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,240
books that were reported guess what the

738
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
treadmill was less than four thousand

739
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,320
dollar and that means the treadmill is

740
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,120
not free and i can use it like a hanger

741
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,720
solve the problem so the problem solved

742
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
and i don't need to run on the trademark

743
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,039
i mean i need to run on the trading

744
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,840
obviously

745
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,440
but um

746
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,279
i have no shame in not running on the

747
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,000
trailer or using it in a different way

748
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,720
or stand on it and pretend that i can't

749
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,159
reach stuff

750
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,919
yes it's it's like that it's it's good

751
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,320
and what was the patch like the patch

752
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,720
was like the most of the patch we're

753
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,960
applying on the server so not much on

754
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,880
the client side but the things that came

755
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,799
to the client side and they closed all

756
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,080
those

757
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,880
directory listing and they probably

758
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,159
renamed their stats file and they are i

759
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,919
can't access them anymore probably they

760
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,399
are still on server somewhere

761
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,799
but then the patch was okay but not

762
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,279
complete in some senses like for example

763
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,000
if they use https rather than http

764
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,919
and they actually actually using a

765
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,840
domain name rather than an ip address

766
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,799
now but they have things like this every

767
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,120
now and then no check certificate what's

768
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,840
the point if you're using https don't

769
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,799
just

770
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,360
have that it that doesn't make any sense

771
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,520
so i still keep no i mean i wanted to

772
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,799
block them because i i wish that they

773
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,320
would have put disney plus there so i

774
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,679
still haven't i mean i blocked them

775
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,520
initially but after the patch i wanted

776
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,600
to see the patch and then

777
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,880
they still have don't have disney

778
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,039
cluster right you may need to block it

779
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,559
and then when they say we have disney

780
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,520
plus i may unblock them so yeah and then

781
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
there are other patches as well so this

782
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,360
patch for example if something fails

783
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,320
there it will use the apk on the server

784
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,559
so before that it just used the

785
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,520
the proper public servers to get the apk

786
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,200
files rather than their own dodgy server

787
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,559
but then if it fails then it goes back

788
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,720
and check the the hash of the file and

789
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,240
the five hash and things like that but

790
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,120
then again it's not that difficult to to

791
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,158
basically uh

792
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,559
do like hash collision these days for

793
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,240
md5 and stuff if you if you can

794
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,799
intercept the network traffic um so you

795
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,760
can exploit it and still my problem is

796
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,720
that this server can still control me um

797
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,880
so the other thing was like i found this

798
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,640
http i was like oh

799
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
they haven't patched something

800
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,840
maybe they're still collecting my data

801
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,720
bounty but no so

802
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,000
look at that

803
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
post request file upload and everything

804
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
i need to see what they're doing with my

805
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,760
face

806
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,320
i opened it it says website i mean this

807
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,559
is this was in chinese i've translated

808
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,399
it the website

809
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,080
has not been filled in accordance with

810
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,159
relevant loads and this was the first

811
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,240
time i felt chinese governments are

812
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,559
actually behind me they're actually

813
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,600
saving me they are helping me so that

814
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,440
was the first time as someone who lives

815
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,960
in this country

816
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,120
felt safe about chinese government so

817
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,440
thank you thank you for blocking it so i

818
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,679
don't need to block it myself

819
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,440
it was good

820
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,399
so

821
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,159
that was good so what ch what has

822
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,760
changed so on the client side of the

823
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,200
trade will not nothing has changed that

824
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,720
much so you still can do the breakout

825
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,320
you can still install the apps that you

826
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,799
want you can still install your ssh you

827
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,600
can still get the roots you can still do

828
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,039
whatever you want

829
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,520
and if the server is still vulnerable i

830
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,399
mean

831
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,520
i said i'm a lazy or not lazy

832
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,720
tired but bounty hunter so i never

833
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,200
really um other than those bugs that i

834
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,799
reported i never went back and test the

835
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,520
uh web server properly properly after

836
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,640
that to see if everything else is okay

837
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,080
or just like you have patched all the

838
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,880
issues i've reported and that's it

839
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,559
classic retest

840
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,720
the payloads are reported or not working

841
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,240
anymore

842
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,519
yeah um and uh yeah so

843
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,679
i feel a little bit safer with the

844
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,679
server but i still think that the ip

845
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,039
address needs to be blocked if you're

846
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,320
paranoid

847
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
and so yeah

848
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,240
and if someone take over the control

849
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,640
server they can still compromise all

850
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,080
these treadmills

851
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,480
so that still is a bad thing

852
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,640
and around for paranoids if you

853
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,799
basically if your paradise about all

854
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,960
these international things don't buy

855
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,480
them

856
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,320
just go to a normal gym like a normal

857
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,960
human being right don't don't pretend

858
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,200
that you're rich and boy a treadmill is

859
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,279
stylish

860
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,279
there is no shame in that though

861
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,720
i have done it

862
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,640
so but then again

863
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
everything that we are buying these days

864
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,039
can be connected to internet think if

865
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,200
you really can afford

866
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,279
a compromise or being controlled or

867
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,480
something like that

868
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,840
um

869
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,000
like i have tried to put everything in a

870
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,480
separate network uh when it comes to

871
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,519
internet of things and so i'm just like

872
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,200
if someone hacks a treadmill and take

873
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,039
control of it guess what they can do

874
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,720
they can run it

875
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,000
and it's going to be behind me and

876
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,640
nobody's on it so i'm safe

877
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,960
because i'm not on the threat now

878
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,120
and nobody else is

879
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,399
so that's good

880
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,600
uh for me

881
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,480
and if if someone even hacks other

882
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,840
devices that are connected to the same

883
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,279
network i have no problem they can

884
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,840
change the lights to

885
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,120
pink

886
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,279
it it doesn't have brown by the way have

887
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,679
you tried your lights doesn't have brown

888
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,200
it can't make it brown

889
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
so yeah

890
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,720
but the sound quality of these

891
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,480
treadmills is not that good either

892
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,159
because when you're running

893
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,960
the sound it goes like

894
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,799
so you probably need to just use your

895
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,399
mobile phone in front of me this is what

896
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,240
i do now because i want to watch disney

897
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,080
plus i just put my mobile phone in front

898
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,240
of the screen and i just use my mobile

899
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,919
phone i was like i could have just gone

900
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,279
with a simpler treadmill probably maybe

901
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,200
should have saved a lot of money but

902
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,120
then i wouldn't have found this bounty

903
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,279
and would have earned more money

904
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,840
so no i am not regretting this it was

905
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,440
actually a good experience from my point

906
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,240
of view this is stylish uh and nobody

907
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,519
can move it because i think it's more

908
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,000
than 100 kilo or something like 150

909
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,120
kilos so it's just as thick it's just if

910
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
if someone like a burglar comes to my

911
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,360
house that's gonna stay there

912
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,440
so it's an asset

913
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,600
so it's good i have it it's good and

914
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,279
don't trust

915
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,120
any smart devices not even your mobile

916
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,679
phones obviously we know that

917
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,159
and uh yeah so that was it and thank you

918
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,960
very much for coming here and a little

919
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,440
bit of advertisement up there so we are

920
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,840
hiring at the mdc as well

921
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,399
so i've been told to say that you can

922
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,080
contact that email address and they're

923
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,279
not going to give you any turret mail

924
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,640
there are other things to give you but

925
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,880
not a threat not especially that then i

926
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,799
saw that photo of the treadmill online i

927
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,600
was like why didn't i buy this one

928
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,039
that looks good i can just look like

929
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,679
that's just running

930
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,120
like a proper

931
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,399
person

932
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
outside running

933
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
and yeah so

934
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,679
but it wasn't available i think it has

935
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,440
just come out and they are super

936
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,159
expensive couldn't afford that

937
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,079
but maybe next time you want to buy a

938
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,239
treadmill like that see if they have bug

939
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,480
bounty program first because if they

940
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,399
have bug bounty program you may be able

941
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,839
to get the money back

942
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,480
if you hack it but don't break it

943
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,239
because if you break that thing it's

944
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,119
just going to be dark all the way it

945
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,760
doesn't make any sense i mean you can

946
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,440
you kind of stick your stickers on it

947
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,639
but

948
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,040
good so probably don't break something

949
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,839
that

950
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,480
doesn't even have a couple there or

951
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,599
the holder beverage holder

952
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,639
and

953
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,119
or mobile holder or whatever yeah so

954
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,480
thank you very much for listening and

955
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,200
coming to this stuff

956
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,800
and so if you have any questions i'm

957
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,240
here to answer

958
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,400
any questions

959
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,040
anyone that needs a fitness guide how to

960
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,680
run a treadmill 101

961
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,919
no

962
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,760
good thank you oh you have a question

963
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,000
okay

964
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,359
uh so basically um there are messages

965
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,800
there are messages that you get back

966
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,280
when you basically deal with

967
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,359
the web server so it was like giving me

968
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,119
some error messages like this is windows

969
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,079
and then uh why can't it how can this be

970
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,160
a windows at the same time be

971
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,000
running like linux commands so error

972
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,480
messages basically yeah

973
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,480
so

974
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,880
so basically this ssh server if you

975
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,359
install ssh server on any android device

976
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,640
if you know the ip address if you are in

977
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,280
the same network then you can just ssh

978
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,800
it gives you username and password like

979
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,000
you can create your username and

980
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
password in the app and open a port and

981
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280
you connect to it you will have a very

982
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,599
low privileged user when you do that as

983
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,200
like you are the app

984
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,640
and then if you can escalate your

985
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,400
privilege obviously you can get more

986
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,079
access if you can make the device to

987
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,200
become in debug mode or

988
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,839
make it root then yeah you can do stuff
