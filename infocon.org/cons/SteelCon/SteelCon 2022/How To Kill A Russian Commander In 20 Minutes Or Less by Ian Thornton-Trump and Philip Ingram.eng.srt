the bat so phil and cheers um and

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,520
thank you for allowing me to come to

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,640
steelcon

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,520
my bio up there says it says most of it

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,280
but i was a british military

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,039
intelligence officer

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,520
for about 26 years

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
in operations all over the world and the

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,879
title

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,200
will probably shock a few people because

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,920
coming into center of academia and

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,760
talking about killing people is not

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
something that you'd normally do

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,920
um having spent a long career in the

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,680
military i want to turn around and say

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,439
that most people in the military are

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,119
pacifists

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,640
and people won't believe that but

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,200
there's two types of pacifism

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,159
one where you will protest

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,840
um and

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,280
suggest that people should sit down and

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
negotiate

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
and that's your approach to peace the

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,520
other where you fight for peace

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,640
a little story that puts into context

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,520
why

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,759
i thought fighting for peace was right

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
in a particular operational theater

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
there was an intercept of

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,079
a communications between two

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,759
commanders on the

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,240
opposing side and they were discussing

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,840
what they were going to do in a village

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,439
and the question from one commander to

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,600
the other was um we've captured the

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,119
village what are we going to do with the

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,560
women and children

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,759
the message came back from the other

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,719
commander you know what to do

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,239
the message came back again saying no

58
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,479
we've captured it they're no threat

59
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,640
message came back from his boss saying

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,560
you know what to do if you don't do it

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,440
we'll sort your family out

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
they were going to kill everyone in that

63
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,879
village

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,520
at that moment in time the moral dilemma

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
of whether it was right to take human

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,080
life or not disappeared completely

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,400
i visited that village after those two

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
commanders had disappeared off this

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,879
planet um on orders from me

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,879
and i went to that village and i saw the

71
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,400
women and children coming out of the

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,080
rubble of the houses that they've been

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
living in and i sat down and i talked to

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,239
them and i saw the smiles in the faces

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,920
of the children as peace was being

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
brought into that particular area

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,040
that is something that was very personal

78
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,519
and gives you that personal dilemma but

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,560
um we were fighting for peace because as

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,720
a human race um there are bad people

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,879
around and a lot of them don't respect

82
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,280
the fact that the right to protest and

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
we should sit down and and discuss

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,159
things

85
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,360
the other bit is when it comes to

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
question time nothing's off limits you

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
know you can ask me any question that

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
you want i'll give you as detailed and

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,239
answer as i can if i go into too much

90
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,599
detail i'm afraid i'm gonna have to

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
shred a few of you before you leave but

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
hey that's just the nature of the

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,319
business ian yeah i guess some

94
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,200
collateral damage um thanks phil because

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,360
i even though i sort of do this topic

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,959
tongue-in-cheek and i've put some

97
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,799
interesting tweets out to kind of hype

98
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,560
to talk a little bit uh you're

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,760
absolutely right that there's a

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
dimension to this that um is i think

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
going to be a bit uncomfortable

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,080
especially we look at uh some of the

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,560
things that have trans transpired um

104
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
we're gonna set the scene right now

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,280
because um those of you that haven't

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
experienced

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
conflict uh

108
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,599
i'm going to somewhat granularily

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,360
may not understand sort of the

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
contemporary battle space you know we

111
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,439
see the pictures over and over on

112
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,400
documentaries in from world war ii and

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,360
vietnam and more recently in iraq and

114
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,159
afghanistan but i think it's important

115
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
to realize that this is

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,840
very much a difficult and messy business

117
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,360
um and that was incredibly complicated

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,358
by the contemporary theater of

119
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,639
operations in the ukraine where the

120
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,880
actual battle for the ukraine started in

121
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,199
2014 with their first invasion by the

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,919
russians and so one of the things that

123
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,479
now that it's headlines and we see the

124
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,720
news and all of the terrible things that

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
have been going on those terrible things

126
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,639
had been going on for quite some time

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,440
until russia decided to become even more

128
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,840
aggressive and move in what they were

129
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,720
calling their special military operation

130
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,880
um and attacked the larger part of the

131
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
ukraine

132
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,960
um

133
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680
i think it's fair to say that we didn't

134
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,440
really have um the dimensions um

135
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,479
before

136
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,759
the contemporary era with cyber and

137
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
space um they were peripheral players in

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,479
most of the major land battles that

139
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,280
we've had up until more recently when

140
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,000
we've

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,280
been involved in counterterrorism and

142
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,199
counterinsurgency operations in the

143
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,960
post-9 11 era

144
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,400
so up there is a slide where you have a

145
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,479
number of people back in the 2000s early

146
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,759
times uh where the united states

147
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,080
government and allies including um

148
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,039
canada and uh the uk and many other

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,080
countries

150
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,840
entered the afghanistan theater and the

151
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,800
iraq theaters um and found themselves in

152
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,919
the midst of an entirely new but not

153
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,759
completely unknown

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,720
um

155
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
battle space which was insurgency and

156
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
counter insurgency you want to talk a

157
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,479
little bit about that well

158
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,160
talk about afghanistan and

159
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,840
um iraq

160
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,240
bottom line yo afghanistan and iraq were

161
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
disasters we should never have gotten

162
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
involved in iraq in the first place and

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,880
afghanistan when we went into it first

164
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
of all after 9 11 for the first two

165
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,400
years the mission was credible because

166
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
it was to remove it as a space for

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
al-qaeda to

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,440
develop and train and deploy

169
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,479
terrors

170
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,720
terrorists overseas but then iraq came

171
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,319
along and

172
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,240
the u.s and uk government split their

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,160
main effort militarily you never split

174
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,080
your main effort um and that then became

175
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,919
a disaster and afghanistan then bumbled

176
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,919
along and changed its mission and

177
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,800
adapted things and we completely and

178
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
utterly destroyed the place and

179
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
destroyed any chance of getting peace

180
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,360
there and were right royally kicked out

181
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
um i i want to expand on a little bit

182
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,759
what about what you said um going back

183
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,400
to ukraine ukraine the first invasion

184
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,560
was 2014.

185
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,880
putin started a lot earlier than that in

186
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
his ambitions to get ukraine he started

187
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,120
in 2003 and this is another domain that

188
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,039
we haven't got up there but is a very

189
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,919
important domain and is affecting all of

190
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,199
us on a daily basis and it's the

191
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,560
information domain he started in 2003

192
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
bringing out his information operations

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,479
talking in a number of speeches from

194
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,240
then up to the 2014 invasion of crimea

195
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,720
um and backing the separatists in the

196
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,000
disputed donbass region um he started uh

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,039
calling the ukrainians little russians

198
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
he did that for two reasons one to

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
demean them but two to try and suggest

200
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,039
that they didn't deserve a national

201
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,759
identity we're seeing that coming out in

202
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,599
what what they're saying today

203
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,759
but also to set the conditions uh within

204
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,080
russia that they wanted to get ukraine

205
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
back in again and that

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
information operation continued um the

207
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,840
whole way through

208
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,759
up until the invasion and continues

209
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,800
today

210
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,960
information is

211
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,840
an area that affects all of us on a

212
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
daily basis in everything that we do and

213
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,879
it's made worse by that

214
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,360
because we all carry there just just

215
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,199
switch the torch on we all we all carry

216
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,560
the ability to

217
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,280
get information in a way that our brains

218
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,479
can't con

219
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,800
process it fast enough um and send

220
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
information out to global leaders

221
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,599
we used to be and i'm talking about uk

222
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,400
us allies and others very very good at

223
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
it during the second world war operation

224
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,479
fortitude convincing hitler that we were

225
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
going in through the paddock and not um

226
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,039
going in in through normandy um the

227
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,680
complexity of that um but it's nothing

228
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,039
new fake news is nothing new sun tzu the

229
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,120
great sixth century chinese philosopher

230
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,599
in general turned around and said um all

231
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,279
deceptions warfare all warfare is

232
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,240
deception deception fake news

233
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,719
misinformation disinformation it is the

234
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,080
big player and everything that we're

235
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,479
doing yeah yeah i i couldn't agree more

236
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,720
with with that analysis and and

237
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,640
especially when you look at the 19th

238
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,680
century of the ukraine um it was invaded

239
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
and occupied on numerous occasions and

240
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,279
it's been a place of of near constant

241
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,360
conflict over the 19th and 20th

242
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,839
centuries um

243
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,600
occasionally a news article will come

244
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,240
out which infuriates me and the latest

245
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
one was when there was some british

246
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,360
rhetoric and u.s rhetoric about the idea

247
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,600
that they would respond with kinetic

248
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,200
force to hack attack um they actually

249
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
maybe forgot that they had already done

250
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,279
this uh when a well-known um uh i would

251
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,480
say a cyber protagonist who started with

252
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,959
team poison um and attacking the sony

253
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,480
network uh went full jihad and started

254
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,720
doing the online recruitment for a group

255
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,360
called isis which they're not nice

256
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,279
people i think they fall firmly in the

257
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,240
category of nice of not nice people um

258
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,920
he was eliminated i've got i've got a

259
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,680
friend who's ex al-qaeda and he is a

260
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
friend he was al-qaeda for 10 years um

261
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
and i i meet him for lunch and coffee

262
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
but well he doesn't drink coffee drinks

263
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,880
dark coke um uh fairly fairly frequently

264
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,399
but i don't think i'll ever have friends

265
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,160
from isis yeah um so the the he was

266
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,279
eliminated in a targeted drone strike um

267
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,800
and for his

268
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
primarily for his activity not the sony

269
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,519
hack i want to underline that but um

270
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
primarily because of his online

271
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
recruiting capabilities of trying to

272
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
bring uh people into isis

273
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,399
um and so you know when nations are

274
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,920
compelled to

275
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,279
strike

276
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,519
the this is the type of decision that is

277
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
agonized and goes through councils and

278
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,760
goes through a great deal decision

279
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,600
making it's not something that countries

280
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
take lightly but when they feel that

281
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
there's an imminent threat to our

282
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
society

283
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,079
then a decision like that is is called

284
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,200
upon

285
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
now

286
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,040
i kind of tried to contextualize this by

287
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
providing what is called a big data

288
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,600
relationship to that counterterrorism

289
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,480
mission

290
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,600
and it looks a lot like this which is a

291
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,480
giant hairball of relationships and in

292
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
fact in this particular picture this is

293
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,519
5 000 facebook friends from a

294
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,519
educational institution

295
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,000
looking for drug traffickers amongst

296
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,560
them with various data sources

297
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,279
now to make it a little bit more easy to

298
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,480
understand

299
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,040
this is what an insurgent cell looks

300
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,160
like and as you can see there's nodes

301
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
that are in control and then there's the

302
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,839
commanders issuing their orders to those

303
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,079
particular nodes and

304
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,480
if you wanted for instance to eliminate

305
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
the capabilities of an organization and

306
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,680
the logistics train it would take an

307
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
enormous amount of effort to reduce one

308
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,360
of those hairballs entirely it is easier

309
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,920
to decapitate the snake than it is to

310
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
kill all of the snakes that exist in

311
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,680
that layer and so what you're looking at

312
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
is created with i2

313
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,200
palinder and um i believe it's also

314
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
called multigo which we use in cyber

315
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
quite a bit are all capable of analyzing

316
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,440
massive amounts of data samples and this

317
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,959
was phone data from insurgents that were

318
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
in communication with each other and

319
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
maybe uh phil do you want to sort of

320
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
walk through what happens when you know

321
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,480
the int guys roll in with something like

322
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,600
this

323
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
yeah you've got it sitting in there and

324
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,079
you've got um a finite number of areas

325
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,079
that you can target to create the effect

326
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,600
everything is about the effect so you

327
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,760
want to try and stop what's going on

328
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,639
it's

329
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,320
very easy to stop the people on the

330
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,920
ground at times when you know where they

331
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,279
are who are going to go and carry out

332
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,959
the attack the two that we've got up

333
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,360
there in the box but once you take them

334
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
out um almost certainly they're going to

335
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,279
be replaced because there's lots more

336
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,720
people who are foot soldiers who can

337
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
come forward and do it and you can keep

338
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,760
taking the foot soldiers out and keep

339
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,120
taking the foot soldiers out but you're

340
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,959
not going to have an effect in stopping

341
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,120
what it is that's going on so you sit

342
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,200
and look at the nodes and you go aha

343
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,959
there's a blob in the center there and

344
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,480
you look where everyone else is feeding

345
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,000
into and that blob is

346
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,160
the one that's sending the uh the

347
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,959
instructions out um and

348
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,639
you try and identify who that is and

349
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,399
they then become onto a high value

350
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,560
target list or a high priority target

351
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,000
list or both

352
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,920
and you hit the center of that node

353
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,000
because it's very difficult then for the

354
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,160
organizations to replicate that central

355
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,920
node of someone in that command and

356
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
control position who's controlling the

357
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,519
foot soldiers on the ground who's making

358
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,120
sure things that go on and you're

359
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
continuously looking out for those so

360
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,399
that from

361
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,639
an intelligence perspective is goldust

362
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,120
exactly now a lot of you might be

363
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,399
thinking that what we're going to talk

364
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,040
about is like highly classified military

365
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,639
stuff but

366
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,639
this guy changed the game for us

367
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,920
completely as capabilities were revealed

368
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,959
that were absolutely out of this world

369
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,000
that really the world had no idea

370
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,959
and even folks within the military

371
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,480
when the

372
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,279
number of and gigantic amount of money

373
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,160
that was being spent on secret nsa

374
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,639
programs that snowden revealed

375
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
i put up a number of other

376
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,680
books there that go into quite exquisite

377
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,839
detail on some of the operations that

378
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,959
were run

379
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,560
during iraq

380
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,519
which

381
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,600
those operations lead us to believe that

382
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,160
they've been improved on and enhanced

383
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,399
in coordination with the ukraine and i'm

384
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,800
talking about the use of malware the use

385
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,320
of as

386
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,959
as phil pointed out uh phone tracking

387
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,120
data and other things that were all

388
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,760
developed around that particular time

389
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,560
um

390
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,360
so

391
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,399
we get into the era of spying um and

392
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,440
spies that are spying on each other and

393
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,639
it became

394
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,880
less about you know building a network

395
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
of humans and more about getting access

396
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,000
to devices and classified materials and

397
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,639
i think what was really kind of

398
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,880
interesting is the revelations of the

399
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,120
snowden documents which this stuff is a

400
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
sample from

401
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,040
talked about a very rapid ability to

402
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,279
exploit those nodes that were discovered

403
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,920
by the intelligence people rapidly in

404
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,560
order to try and degrade the terrorist

405
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,279
activity that um nations were faced with

406
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,880
and back in 2013 well from the era of

407
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,959
2000 to 2013

408
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,839
remarkable disclosures about the ability

409
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,160
to listen in on cell phone devices the

410
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,920
ability to spoof

411
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,760
text messages from

412
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,040
commanders led to some rapid degrading

413
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,720
of the insurgent cells and the bomb

414
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,800
makers during that particular time and

415
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
you can see some of the different

416
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,959
programs that were in operation

417
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,920
interestingly enough the nsa also

418
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
allowed

419
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,519
the dea and other american law

420
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,000
enforcement agencies access to some of

421
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,079
these capabilities when going after

422
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,199
narcotics cartels as well and in fact

423
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,399
enlisted the us navy in a um

424
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
intelligence role by listening to the

425
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,360
various narcotics trafficking uh talk

426
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,519
that was going on on cell phones so

427
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,480
again

428
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,720
the nation state capabilities that we

429
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,519
were revealed to us from snowden set the

430
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,880
stage for essentially what became a

431
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,639
whole bunch of different capabilities

432
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,320
that we see today

433
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,759
when you looked at the mueller

434
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,360
indictment many of you know what the

435
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,000
mueller indictment is is the indictment

436
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,680
of whether or not the russians

437
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,800
interfered with the u.s election you saw

438
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,880
a number of very interesting pictures

439
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,360
taken of various russian operators that

440
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
all looked like they came from the

441
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,120
webcam of their laptops so we know for a

442
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
fact that um under the right

443
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,399
circumstances the united states

444
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,880
capability to get into adversarial

445
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
nation state devices does exist and they

446
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,279
can use it to

447
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,759
feed the necessary information into the

448
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,880
um

449
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,759
into

450
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,160
the law enforcement and then finally

451
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,759
down at the bottom and i think this is

452
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,160
the kind of thing that becomes really

453
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
interesting from

454
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,759
again revelations and snowden the

455
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,560
extraordinary capabilities that were

456
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,279
developed by the nsa tao you may know

457
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,480
them as well

458
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,000
as

459
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,480
the equation group i think is what we

460
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,680
call them

461
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,079
in various kaspersky documents and

462
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,400
kaspersky and the nsa have not had a

463
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,280
particularly good relationship um to say

464
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,799
the very least

465
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,640
um do you have some thoughts about sort

466
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,319
of the move to cyber well yes um i don't

467
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,679
want to bring in a bit about snowden and

468
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,400
why he was so damaging um intelligence

469
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
business is nothing new you know it's

470
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,839
described as the second oldest

471
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,280
profession we'll not discuss what the

472
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,280
oldest is um uh and hint it's not cyber

473
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,840
it's it's it's it's been it's been there

474
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,960
forever

475
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,280
the methods of gathering intelligence

476
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,200
whether it be using human sources

477
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,840
whether been using um electronic sources

478
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,679
whether it be using there's only finite

479
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,360
numbers of ways of doing things there's

480
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,440
only finite numbers of ways of being

481
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,120
able to get into

482
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
a mobile phone to get into the signal

483
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,360
that's on there to be able to deal with

484
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,039
people so if any techniques are exposed

485
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,559
it

486
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,000
compromises different sources of that

487
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,720
intelligence it can take months if not

488
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,799
years to get back into it again and you

489
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,520
lose your total feed and therefore

490
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,400
that's why there's so much

491
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
classification around what people are

492
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,960
doing

493
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,080
there's not a huge number of different

494
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,679
techniques

495
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,559
and

496
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,360
they're not new um the first ever

497
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,760
nation-state deliberate denial of

498
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,559
service attack

499
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
in a conflict environment uh i'll very

500
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
quickly go around and i'm gonna count

501
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,559
back from the 1990s it wasn't after that

502
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,480
and kind of a very quick show of hands

503
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
of people who think which decade it's in

504
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,039
so i'm going to go back 90s

505
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,880
80s

506
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,120
70s

507
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
60s

508
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,039
fifties

509
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
forties

510
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,799
thirties

511
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,200
twenties

512
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,039
ten

513
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,720
zero

514
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,360
ten you're right fifth of august 1914.

515
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,919
whenever the um

516
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,080
cable ship alert set sail from dover

517
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,520
harbor went into the center of the

518
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,840
channel um and um

519
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
um

520
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,480
the telecom cable yeah and slipped four

521
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
telecom cables that were carrying uh the

522
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,400
uh the telegraph communications to the

523
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,520
rest of the world from continental

524
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,440
europe it was the first aggressive act

525
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
by the british of the first world war

526
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,039
um and

527
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,679
uh it resulted in the fifth cable being

528
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,480
left

529
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,559
um alone the fifth cable just happened

530
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,400
to go through the uk and it just

531
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,960
happened to be wiretapped um and it also

532
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,240
caused the german um politicians uh

533
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,520
to communicate with their embassies

534
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
around the world over high frequency

535
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,640
radio communications which we'd

536
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,400
intercepted and with uh broken their

537
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
encryption on it um what did that lead

538
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,320
to that led to the intercept of what was

539
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,919
called the zimmermann telegram the

540
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,919
zimmermann telegram was

541
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,600
instrumental whenever it was exposed to

542
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,360
the americans and bringing the americans

543
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,880
into the first world war that's why they

544
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,840
came in

545
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
deliberate denial of service attack to

546
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
force uh someone onto another means

547
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
which you have already compromised um to

548
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,559
then use that compromised material for

549
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,919
an effect um none of this is new

550
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
we just have so many more methods of

551
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,000
doing it and that's the thing to

552
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,240
look at and to put it into perspective

553
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,320
yeah and and this is again you know

554
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,679
rinse repeat in and change um and adapt

555
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,760
to the technologies that are out there

556
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,520
you'll see that um

557
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,679
in order to get an effect

558
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,960
we went from teams on the ground to

559
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,120
autonomous systems

560
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,159
to

561
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,039
drones uh with various capabilities that

562
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,640
were put up for tracking individuals but

563
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,880
i want to kind of go a little bit more

564
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,559
forward and talk about the 2013 op anon

565
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,520
attack

566
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
on syria

567
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,640
and um this was all osint driven um at

568
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,200
at the periphery end of the annual

569
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,559
pilgrimage to las vegas uh nevada um

570
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,120
during well the next couple of weeks i

571
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,320
think some of you are making the

572
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,559
pilgrimage i talked to last night

573
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,360
but here's an example of using data that

574
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,840
was open sourced in order to identify

575
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,120
targets within the syrian government who

576
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,440
were doing very naughty things to

577
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,000
minority populations in the wake of the

578
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,280
arab spring riots uh that

579
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,120
went there and

580
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,280
i would say collectively the anonymous

581
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
organization felt that what the syrian

582
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,799
government was doing was pretty

583
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,000
abhorrent

584
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,200
so

585
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,039
we found a number of interesting devices

586
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,960
and um anyone know what rtsp is

587
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,919
anyone that's not bushido token

588
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,640
do you know what rtsp is real time

589
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,000
streaming protocol otherwise known as

590
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
quicktime

591
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
so as you can see on these particular

592
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,280
devices they had um port four five five

593
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,559
four open and there's a handy link to a

594
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,400
blog by trend micro

595
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,440
of how to exploit rtsp

596
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,280
so kind of a a great example of how um

597
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,200
the syrian government was able to be

598
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
infiltrated by anonymous operations

599
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,480
and in order to do this um

600
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
one of the targeted and frequently

601
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,200
targeted devices are printers and the

602
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,679
reason for that was to deny the ability

603
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
to have printed orders and force as uh

604
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,159
as my colleague phil talked about the

605
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,559
same tactic of using

606
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,039
radio and or fiber networks that had

607
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,600
already been compromised so as you can

608
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,440
see from the

609
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
past hundred years

610
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,520
we're using the same techniques only

611
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,240
modified uh considerably

612
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,720
so i want to now sort of now that we've

613
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,480
set the stage in the introduction to

614
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,000
what we're actually going to be talking

615
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,120
about we're now end up in the situation

616
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
in 2014

617
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,600
where

618
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,280
the ukraine was invaded and nato

619
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,159
was not necessarily passive about it

620
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,280
however

621
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,880
uh they realized very quickly that they

622
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
would need to help and support at this

623
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,200
particular time the fear of a global

624
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,679
russian cyber war was quite on the minds

625
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,400
of everyone as as a result of not petya

626
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,480
and wannacry attacks

627
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,880
which really rattled and concerned a lot

628
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,159
of organizations along with the ongoing

629
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,320
attacks that nation states were faced

630
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,840
when it came to national critical

631
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,080
infrastructure so um i i i would say a

632
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,960
advisory and warning group was stood up

633
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,520
looking at the ukraine back in 2014

634
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,799
which became

635
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,880
quite the cyber battlefield

636
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,760
in terms of understanding how uh

637
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,159
networks would be attacked in time of

638
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,200
war and what could be done in order to

639
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,520
defend those networks and so i think

640
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,320
we'll go to you now to talk a little bit

641
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,200
about

642
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,760
how a big part of this was the

643
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,520
disinformation that spewed out of russia

644
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,360
well as i said earlier disinformation is

645
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,840
a critical part of everything that

646
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,440
the russians do the russians actually

647
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
have a doctrine um

648
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
called maskarovka which is all about

649
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,520
masking a perfect example of maskarovka

650
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,720
the sergey skripal attack in salisbury

651
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,960
whenever um theresa may stood up in

652
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
parliament and said it were the russians

653
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,919
gov um vlad the man we're calling you

654
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,000
out um vladimir putin turned around and

655
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,159
said no no no no it wasn't it wasn't me

656
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,279
it must have escaped from porting down

657
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,039
um the british chemical warfare

658
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,640
establishment just on the outskirts of

659
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
salisbury um and he wanted people to

660
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
believe it um the leader of the

661
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,159
opposition then stood up in parliament

662
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,039
and said yes we have to be completely

663
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,559
certain it was the russians behind this

664
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,240
it could have come from somewhere else

665
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,559
didn't quite cite what uh vladimir had

666
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,120
said um uh and all of a sudden that

667
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
started it a bit vladimir putin was

668
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,200
sitting in moscow behind his big oak

669
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,799
desk with a big super long desk big the

670
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,559
super long desk with a big tumbler of

671
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,400
vodka over ice in the best russian

672
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,320
crystal with a white cat on his knee

673
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
going yes they're doing exactly what

674
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,279
they want he just wanted people to be

675
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,440
putting alternative views out and not

676
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,760
pointing the finger directly at putin

677
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,880
the whole way through they've got a

678
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
doctrine of that and everything that

679
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,440
they do um is is focused around it um

680
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,279
and therefore you have to take all

681
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,279
messaging with a pinch of salt and

682
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,400
understand where it's coming from and

683
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,600
understand that people are trying to

684
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,679
influence you and yes they can influence

685
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,360
you and the russians are good at i'll go

686
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,799
back to the u.s elections um

687
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,400
did the russians interfere with u.s

688
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,760
elections hell yes did the russians

689
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,840
interfere with the brexit referendum

690
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,159
hell yes did the russians interfere with

691
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,320
some other european elections hell yes

692
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,279
um

693
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,880
you go onto my website and look at

694
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,360
hacking your serotonin there is very

695
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,600
good research out there a good academic

696
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,760
research that's put into a practical

697
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
application about how you can change the

698
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,400
way people think over a period of time

699
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,480
by taking that big data that's out there

700
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
by analyzing the big data that's

701
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,120
associated with an individual but also

702
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,799
with all of the individuals that are

703
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,799
linked to that individual work out what

704
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,960
they like what they don't like reinforce

705
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,840
certain views and undermine other views

706
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,000
by targeted messaging and targeted feeds

707
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,840
that come up onto social media and you

708
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,679
know what social media people are using

709
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,120
because it's because it's in there the

710
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,559
open source intelligence tools that

711
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,240
exist out there at the moment i got

712
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,120
briefed on one last week that blew my

713
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,760
mind i could put on that open source

714
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
intelligence tool a geographic circle

715
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,000
around this building and watch every

716
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
single social media output from any

717
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
device of anyone that's inside this

718
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
building um going up and being being

719
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,400
posted online and it's targeting it and

720
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,960
i can do that legally

721
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,320
a lot of the nation states that are out

722
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,080
there don't care about what's legal and

723
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
what's illegal whenever it comes to

724
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,520
looking at what's going on and getting

725
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,440
into the big data and they'll use that

726
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,559
to manipulate

727
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,960
um and we're seeing that across the

728
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,760
board um uh both

729
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,600
from the nation state of effect but then

730
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,039
you get the blurring between the nation

731
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,559
state and the serious and organized

732
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,799
crime um and the russian oligarchs the

733
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,279
russian oligarch system

734
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,520
it only works because they control

735
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,159
different aspects of the russian economy

736
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,600
and they're only allowed to do that

737
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,520
because they've got a political master

738
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,080
sitting over them who controls them and

739
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,440
they look after his money and he looks

740
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,960
after their money and you've got a

741
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,919
symbiotic relationship um and they

742
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,760
control all the criminal groups so

743
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,159
whenever we hear of different apts

744
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,159
operating out of russia

745
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,799
uh that are um serious and organized

746
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,720
crime well they're paying their dues

747
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,559
into the appropriate oligarch who's

748
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,399
paying their dues into the political

749
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,480
system that are taking the tasking and

750
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,679
being allowed to get on with what they

751
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,960
want they make their money they're

752
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
allowed to keep the money that they they

753
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,000
get but

754
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,520
they're part of the whole

755
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
government and political system they

756
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,200
they just want a boat ride i think is

757
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,720
what they want to they want to be able

758
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,480
to do that i'm on a boat

759
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,440
um

760
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
that's a great sort of high-level view

761
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,840
of where we ended up but it became

762
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,679
really interesting to see it playing out

763
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,159
on the state of affairs that was

764
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,960
revealed about russian society so 30

765
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,480
years uh since roughly the the the um

766
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,600
russians decided to apart from communism

767
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,399
and embrace western at least brands and

768
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,279
ideology has all been revealed to

769
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,840
understand that this was the biggest

770
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,520
giant smorgasbord of money that we've

771
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,720
ever seen uh pour out of not only the

772
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,039
post-soviet um uh

773
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,159
countries but from russia itself as

774
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,200
graft took hold within the organization

775
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,080
and what we've seen is evidence of this

776
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
in a number of different capacities

777
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,880
specifically around um the sanctioning

778
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,320
of a tremendous amount of russian super

779
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,960
rich and seizure of their property on a

780
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,559
global scale uh that has sort of i think

781
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,559
really revealed to us that uh russia

782
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,440
is completely a corrupt society and that

783
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,559
it's almost impossible uh to do and

784
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,640
transact legitimate business

785
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,799
and i think the other final thing is

786
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,000
that one of the

787
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,320
i would say smoking guns as it were with

788
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,200
the um with the uh the poisonings that

789
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,159
happened

790
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,240
um came as a result of an a um

791
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,360
a literally a russian spies um expense

792
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,880
claim uh that put them um in the same

793
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,159
place as the uh attacks occurred

794
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:30,960
so

795
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,240
um

796
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,039
and i call them the uh the the semi

797
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,520
intelligence service of russia uh

798
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,360
because even though we get the huge

799
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,399
headlines

800
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,720
of you know russians have infiltrated

801
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,360
and stolen data and you know um all of

802
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,679
those kind of things uh to be fair it's

803
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,840
usually because something wasn't patched

804
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,919
or somebody clicked on a link that they

805
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,200
shouldn't have

806
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,399
so so it's it i think there is a

807
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,360
mythology on the level of sophistication

808
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,720
there is and you have to remember that

809
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,080
part of the the overall network is the

810
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,440
human you have to patch the human as

811
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,960
much as you have to patch the network

812
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,440
that's in there and you know as ian said

813
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,320
um the bell and cat who were brilliant

814
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,640
in bringing out this exposure um one of

815
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,760
the things that they identified very

816
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,480
quickly was that all of the gru officers

817
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
um not only were getting their passports

818
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,320
with sequential numbers at different

819
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,720
times but um a vast majority of them had

820
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,240
registered their cars at gru

821
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,159
headquarters why they registered their

822
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,080
cars at gru headquarters well it's

823
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,520
because whenever they got stopped for

824
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,159
speeding or drink driving or anything

825
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,919
else and the russian policeman tapped

826
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,279
into his computer and looked at the

827
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,720
address of where the car was registered

828
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,039
went oh no

829
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,799
 there's no way am i going to be

830
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,320
able to do anything with this i would

831
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,480
let them go away so for corruption

832
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
inside the country it compromised their

833
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
intelligence agencies

834
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,559
all right so we're gonna fast forward

835
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,600
um and what nato found was um putting

836
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,440
soldiers on the ground in hostile

837
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,000
countries uh is a very expensive

838
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,240
endeavor to do the sorts of things to

839
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
find the bad guys so in the past i would

840
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,880
say 25 years plus uh nato has heavily

841
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,440
invested in something called isr okay

842
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,200
and you want to sort of break down what

843
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,039
isr is i think we've got a slide coming

844
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,039
up but i'll just quickly mention that

845
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,799
these are all the different platforms

846
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,960
that are nato you've got rivet joint

847
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,360
from the uk down in the lower uh left

848
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,559
corner you have a ea

849
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,399
18 prowler

850
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,720
a replacement for the grumman

851
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,840
platform

852
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,360
but interestingly enough and then you've

853
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,159
got the new version which that's um an

854
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,320
artist's rendering because the actual

855
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
device is so classified there's no

856
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,919
pictures of it available publicly of the

857
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,399
kh-11 spy satellites that are up there

858
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,440
if he had said kh11 20 years ago um in

859
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,799
this public environment he'd have been

860
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,559
um locked away yeah is it still

861
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
classified top secret yeah and you know

862
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,840
aviation weekly notwithstanding right um

863
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,679
so there is an interesting thing that i

864
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,679
came across in doing a research for this

865
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,080
and you can imagine what

866
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,960
painting on the side of your ea6 growler

867
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,279
with a dude with a lightning bolt

868
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,679
through him and um the open source

869
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,760
intelligence on that is means that that

870
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,240
airframe was involved in the direct

871
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,080
shall we say suppression slash

872
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,720
elimination of a target

873
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,760
that was talking on a cell phone

874
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,799
so that when the um

875
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,720
six ea 18 growlers were sent to poland

876
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,720
probably stuck a really big cord with

877
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,039
those kind of overt capabilities that

878
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,440
they're now on public display about what

879
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,080
that airpla airframe platform can

880
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,600
accomplish

881
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,799
and

882
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,640
we now look at

883
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
the battlefield space from an

884
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,080
electronics emissions so on the

885
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,000
right hand side was an amazing open

886
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
source intelligence project

887
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,559
which i am confident

888
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,039
yeah sorry yeah left-hand side i am

889
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,080
confident that um this data was taken

890
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,559
directly from cell phone providers but

891
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,760
that's every russian cell phone uh

892
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,600
that was on the ukrainian 3g network um

893
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,760
put onto a map

894
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,240
now if we can do this in the open source

895
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,120
world i am pretty certain that it can be

896
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,000
done

897
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,240
far more granularly and far more

898
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,279
accurately to then produce what we're

899
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,480
seeing here

900
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,279
which is an electronic version of where

901
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,200
the bad guy's at you want to talk about

902
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,960
that and yes you can look at the nodes

903
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,399
again go back to the nodal analysis you

904
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,159
can see where the communications are

905
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,080
coming from the center is that going out

906
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,279
to different places that will then give

907
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,399
you the headquarters it'll give you the

908
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,399
commanders it'll give you the location

909
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,760
that's there and if you've got

910
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
something that can

911
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,159
have an effect on that location military

912
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,880
speak for uh blow it to pieces

913
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,440
then you can use it um the the pictures

914
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,960
of the platforms that are up there you

915
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
bring all of the intelligences together

916
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,360
isr intelligence surveillance and

917
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,600
reconnaissance for target acquisition

918
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,240
purposes so sometimes it's called istar

919
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,360
um and you've got space-based non-air

920
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,119
breathing you've got air breathing so

921
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,239
they fly in the air um and you've got um

922
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,839
uh subsurface

923
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,320
submarines etc and you've got

924
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,800
ground-based systems that are there nato

925
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
has no ground-based systems that it'll

926
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,199
admit um because nato hasn't deployed

927
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,839
any into ukraine certain nation states

928
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,879
may do um air systems are flying on a

929
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,480
daily basis the whole way around the

930
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,040
outside of the ukrainian border um north

931
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,879
south uh eastern

932
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,879
sorry not north um

933
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,159
uh west

934
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,480
and south um and are feeding the

935
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,599
intelligence that they're getting to

936
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,879
give these sorts of pictures into the

937
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,800
ukrainians so they've got a good idea of

938
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,320
exactly where all the russian commanders

939
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,800
are um and they'll do everything from

940
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,119
intercepting the signals communications

941
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,119
looking at radars because a radar is

942
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,879
associated with a weapon system through

943
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,239
to what's called measurement and

944
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,760
signature intelligence which is

945
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
fantastic i can tell you if a vehicle's

946
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,280
been in a position 24 hours ago and

947
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,720
where it's moved to and whether that

948
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,880
vehicle was a was a wheeled vehicle or a

949
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,359
tracked vehicle um using

950
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,359
certain techniques with measurement

951
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,359
and signature intelligence and you bring

952
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,079
together all of these assets

953
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,599
at all different levels to give you that

954
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,680
wider intelligence picture and take what

955
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,280
you've got on the left which is really

956
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,520
comprehensive and actually put an awful

957
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,960
lot of color on it and you might

958
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,599
actually be able to identify by name who

959
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,200
some of the individuals are that's

960
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,240
correct and so this folks is the big

961
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,160
data software piece that we're talking

962
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,640
about in terms of trying to get to the

963
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,040
right hand output are

964
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,520
i'm going to say this hands output which

965
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,240
is a clear picture of where important

966
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,960
assets are on the battle space which

967
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,480
then goes into a planning uh phase

968
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,280
and i just want to mention the fact that

969
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,680
it is highly likely that the cyber

970
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,880
capabilities of western nations along

971
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,119
with the ukrainians are being used to

972
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,920
aid the accuracy of that of gathering

973
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
that particular data and we'll talk

974
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,119
about that in a moment um i just want to

975
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,800
quickly contextualize russia right now

976
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,280
and phil will run down fairly quickly

977
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,680
here on um kind of

978
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,839
if anyone is still facebook friending

979
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,240
russia

980
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,920
anyone's still facebook friending russia

981
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,320
well um we've got we've got fen sitters

982
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,400
so they haven't blocked russia in what's

983
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,040
going on um and we saw that in the

984
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,359
united nations vote but if we're looking

985
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,040
at it in particular the main countries

986
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
that um are sitting on the fence we've

987
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,880
got china we've got india we've got

988
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,480
pakistan whoever thought india and

989
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,480
pakistan would be political bedfellows

990
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,640
in something and we've got iran and a

991
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,560
number of other north korea a number of

992
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,920
other small countries why are they

993
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,480
sitting on the fence um

994
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,000
they're sitting on the fence because

995
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,240
they can see opportunities a to look

996
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,040
after

997
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
their own economic needs by getting

998
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,520
cheap grain cheap oil cheap cooking oil

999
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
and other bits and pieces out of russia

1000
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
china's sitting there going we can be

1001
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,880
the broker for this because we can make

1002
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,040
money from it on oh by the way we can

1003
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,079
buy russia by russian natural resources

1004
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,680
um and all the rest of when the because

1005
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,000
the war will finish and china plans 25

1006
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,240
years ahead um they've done that through

1007
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,440
most of africa um and uh

1008
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,599
they'll be sitting there watching their

1009
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,599
own little territorial ambitions around

1010
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,880
the world and whether there's an

1011
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,400
opportunity for them to go and exploit

1012
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,720
those the thing that has stopped china

1013
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,440
going into taiwan is xi jinping looked

1014
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
at the economic sanctions that were

1015
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,880
brought in against russia very very

1016
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,800
quickly indeed and went we can't afford

1017
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,240
that against china and chinese business

1018
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,720
and therefore um oh general please take

1019
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,880
that plan to go and invade taiwan that i

1020
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,640
told you to take off the shelf and put

1021
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,320
it back on again and sprinkle some dust

1022
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,119
over it just in case their isr assets

1023
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,200
can see that we've moved it yeah a

1024
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,520
hundred percent that um

1025
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,839
so to just kind of give you the quick

1026
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,680
rundown of the space that we're working

1027
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,480
in from the russian perspective um

1028
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
they're outclassed in a number of ways

1029
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,520
especially on the intelligence side uh

1030
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,320
you can consider that the entire network

1031
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,000
of the ukraine's

1032
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,880
3g and used to be 4g

1033
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,280
has been compromised from a russian

1034
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,320
perspective so that led to some

1035
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,640
startling capabilities that

1036
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,160
nato has been assisting ukraine with uh

1037
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,400
and that is uh this

1038
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,520
which is the capabilities of taking

1039
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,400
nato's doctrine and capability and

1040
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,720
marrying that up to a contemporary

1041
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
warfare environment like we really

1042
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,320
haven't seen before

1043
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
um and i think probably to sort of like

1044
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,960
um

1045
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,560
to sort of put some uh uh perspective on

1046
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,520
this i'll let phil sort of talk about

1047
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,400
what the joint isr pro process is and

1048
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,520
why that became such a powerful tool and

1049
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,599
i want to draw your attention to the

1050
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,560
lady soldier down in the corner

1051
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,160
holding a cell phone uh where they have

1052
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,000
um one 800 uh spot russia um where you

1053
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,040
can call in if you see a russian um

1054
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,000
military vehicle or russian troops so go

1055
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,800
ahead

1056
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
yeah they the diagrams set themselves

1057
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,079
effectively

1058
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,400
they're they're almost the same thing

1059
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,079
the intelligence cycle is what i use

1060
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,240
direct say what you want

1061
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,160
that's the hardest bit asking the

1062
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,839
question you know what what is the

1063
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,440
question that you want answered and

1064
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,079
remember intelligence is all about um

1065
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,520
gathering information that you don't

1066
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,680
know so using donald rumsfeld you have

1067
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,800
to know what you don't know and then go

1068
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,960
out and find it

1069
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
and then filling those gaps in to allow

1070
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,880
you to make decisions so

1071
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,359
direct your collection assets collect

1072
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,359
what the information that you need

1073
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,880
process that information together and

1074
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,480
see if it answers the question and give

1075
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,599
it out to the people who are going to do

1076
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,280
something about it

1077
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,000
the

1078
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,680
in many cases those that are going to do

1079
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,720
something about it could be go and

1080
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,560
collect more information so you tell

1081
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,599
your your um isr processes what you want

1082
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,599
them to go and pick up and this is where

1083
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,800
you're telling individual sensing

1084
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,040
platforms to do stuff so i want you to

1085
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,560
go and hoover up

1086
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,760
the

1087
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,440
mobile phone data from there i want you

1088
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,359
to look for this particular number or

1089
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,760
this particular um imei

1090
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,400
number registering on that particular

1091
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,599
cell tar you're getting into the

1092
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,319
granularity or you could be directing um

1093
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,079
people on the ground um something that

1094
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,440
the ukrainians have got they're running

1095
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,079
a lot of soe type operations yeah um so

1096
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,000
someone who's still behind

1097
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,880
in

1098
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,480
enemy lines they're still in the dumbass

1099
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,720
region but they're they're ukrainians

1100
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,560
and they're loyal to uh the ukrainian

1101
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,560
government to go and see where different

1102
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
commanders are do they go to that coffee

1103
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,560
shop that we think they're in um at

1104
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,319
seven o'clock every morning answer yes

1105
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,680
we're gonna hit that coffee shop but

1106
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,280
we're gonna hit the coffee shop with uh

1107
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
either sniper rifle or an improvised

1108
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,800
explosive device or something else and

1109
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,880
therefore it's all a cycle and it's a

1110
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,800
continuous cycle that goes the whole way

1111
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,280
around um achieving that list of high

1112
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
value targets and high priority targets

1113
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,880
and the effects that you want to deal

1114
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,680
with them

1115
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,079
on many cases it's to

1116
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,839
take out the target

1117
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,760
in lots of other cases it's actually to

1118
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
confirm that the target is there

1119
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,960
and they could be very valuable and

1120
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,480
you're listening in and you say do not

1121
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,839
take out that target because they're

1122
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,240
giving us too much valuable information

1123
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,079
yeah and in the words of borat

1124
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,240
tremendous success uh as we approach the

1125
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,839
elimination of various leadership

1126
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,480
including the highest-ranked uh russian

1127
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,520
general who was wounded um and narrowly

1128
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,160
escaped from his luck with his life when

1129
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,280
the ukraine hit a headquarters it's

1130
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,359
highly likely that they would have known

1131
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,280
that he was operating in the region

1132
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,079
we've seen the results of the attack on

1133
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,440
the moskva which was the flagship of the

1134
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,960
russian fleet uh we saw the tremendous

1135
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,920
ability of one intelligence analyst on

1136
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,599
the ground he was actually a combat

1137
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,520
engineer who said this looks like a

1138
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,440
really great place to cross a river

1139
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
really want you to listen if you hear

1140
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,119
any boat engines

1141
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,839
gets the report i hear boat engines

1142
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,800
roger that and they were able to deploy

1143
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,520
and um really uh mess up the russians

1144
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,480
attempts to do uh river crossing in

1145
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,040
daylight which is never a good idea um

1146
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,960
and usually ends in tears

1147
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,200
and i think one of the biggest things uh

1148
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,800
that came out of this was the

1149
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,440
revelations that the germans and other

1150
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,920
allied nations were monitoring russian

1151
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,160
soldier communications and could

1152
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,520
identify

1153
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,599
folks that gave the orders for various

1154
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,319
massacres that occurred uh in the area

1155
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,800
for follow-up war crimes tribunals when

1156
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,119
when this all becomes so

1157
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,480
it was a digital war that had a giant

1158
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,560
sort of kinetic component

1159
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,079
and they we're getting towards the end

1160
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,720
of this to say has war fundamentally

1161
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,200
changed because of the introductions of

1162
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,920
these new technologies the soe type of

1163
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,160
operations which is the gentleman his

1164
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,880
identity is cloaked the ability to build

1165
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,680
complex weapon systems at home such as

1166
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,480
the neptune missile you see there and

1167
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,520
handheld drones being used to extend the

1168
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,640
ability and reach and visibility of

1169
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,560
just the standard soldier that's sitting

1170
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,280
out there phil your thoughts um the

1171
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,760
numbers of different ways of having that

1172
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
those effects on the battle space and

1173
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,359
and forming on those effects has grown

1174
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,839
enormously um but i'll come back and

1175
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,280
simplify a little bit more and because

1176
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,359
we're talking cyber in many cases here

1177
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,480
and the question that i get asked

1178
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,560
frequently was why has cyber not had a

1179
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,760
greater effect

1180
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,560
on what's going on in inside ukraine um

1181
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,800
and it's twofold the first one is

1182
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,280
ukraine has been preparing um and

1183
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,800
fighting a cyber battle with russia

1184
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,599
since 2014 in fact before 2014 so

1185
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,280
they're well prepared for it they've got

1186
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,359
the defenses in place they know how to

1187
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,400
make sure that the networks are

1188
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,880
protected and um the rest of the world

1189
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,520
is helping ukraine in doing that um so

1190
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,599
this is nothing new the second and the

1191
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,920
most important effect is this is a

1192
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,280
kinetic war

1193
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,160
you cannot cyber intercept a one five

1194
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
two millimeter high explosive shell or

1195
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,839
seven point six two millimeter short

1196
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,000
bullet or it has no effect on a forty

1197
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,319
year old um uh

1198
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,960
jet aircraft that is dropping dumb bombs

1199
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,560
um there's no cyber component that you

1200
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,240
can interfere with on that

1201
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,079
and that's what's going on on the ground

1202
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,920
and that's what's having the horrific

1203
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,440
effect and that's what's unfortunately

1204
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,800
killing people

1205
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,520
yeah and sort of to put an echo on that

1206
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,440
is that the cyber war that we thought

1207
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,280
was going to happen didn't but the

1208
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,680
innovations of a nation that is known

1209
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,000
for having talented programmers and

1210
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,240
being able to uh build applications

1211
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,440
rapidly created an app space for the

1212
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,640
ukrainian soldier and it went high level

1213
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,200
that accelerated their capabilities of

1214
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,880
using the resources that they have and

1215
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,480
applying them to the targets that they

1216
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,680
found this was actually the ability of

1217
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
big data gis

1218
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,079
as well as talented programmers within

1219
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,040
the ukraine building applications for

1220
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,480
the military

1221
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,440
to enhance its capabilities so think

1222
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,280
about that when you get the ca near

1223
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,280
constant um ukrainian uh and uh develop

1224
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,400
outsource um uh messages on linkedin is

1225
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,319
that these are some very talented and

1226
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,720
capable people so do you want to just

1227
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,880
sort of close a little bit on your view

1228
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,599
of sort of the app space for modern

1229
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,880
warfare

1230
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,160
well i think it's more than modern

1231
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,480
warfare it's it's it's modern society um

1232
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,240
and we have to realize that you're from

1233
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,640
an intelligence perspective um your

1234
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,880
intelligence information warfare and all

1235
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,800
the rest of it used to be

1236
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,040
fixated on the battle space and we're

1237
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
seeing that inside ukraine we're also

1238
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,400
seeing it spilling out of ukraine

1239
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,599
elsewhere and all of us are targets

1240
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,920
academia is a big target for

1241
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,680
nation-state attacks especially where

1242
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,599
there's research going on into

1243
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,680
the use of these sorts of areas

1244
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,400
and

1245
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,640
that means that individuals in academia

1246
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,040
who may be connected through their first

1247
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,640
level connection or second level

1248
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,079
connection to key people that are

1249
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,480
working on that are potential targets if

1250
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,560
it's a route to get into things and one

1251
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560
of the biggest threat vectors i think at

1252
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,920
the moment

1253
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,720
is

1254
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,079
um through our smart devices and it's

1255
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,560
through the apps on our smart devices

1256
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,319
and it's understanding your what's

1257
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,000
behind the apps how many people download

1258
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,760
an app and actually read through the

1259
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,920
terms and conditions or just click go on

1260
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,920
it if i ask people to put their hands in

1261
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,359
the air here

1262
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,440
as to how many people got tick-tock on

1263
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,960
their devices

1264
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,200
and uh then i had another couple of

1265
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,800
hours and could explain just how

1266
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,319
compromised tiktok is and that means

1267
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,560
that every single thing that you put

1268
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,640
through your device is being fed off to

1269
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,960
an intelligence agency um all of your

1270
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,200
photographs all of your emails all of

1271
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,079
your contacts um every single thing that

1272
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,440
is processed on that device is going off

1273
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,359
to the intelligence agency

1274
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,240
the same thing when pokemon go hit the

1275
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
ground pokemon go and i was a sad

1276
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,520
individual who did read through the

1277
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,359
terms and conditions and if you look at

1278
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,760
it it was developed by an individual um

1279
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,680
uh who set up a company that was

1280
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,119
partially funded by a front company of

1281
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,359
the cia

1282
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,520
and that was what was overtly available

1283
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,880
what concerned me in the terms and

1284
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,400
conditions and the data privacy side of

1285
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,720
things was um it clearly said what it

1286
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,240
would take off your device and it was

1287
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,400
literally everything anything that was

1288
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,680
on there any data source um whether your

1289
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,960
emails your contacts your sms messages

1290
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,359
anything it give you give permission to

1291
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,200
access that and it also had a little

1292
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,720
line in there saying that all of this

1293
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,720
data would be transmitted back to

1294
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,880
servers in continental united states

1295
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,480
question why

1296
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
well that allowed certain legislation to

1297
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,240
come into play for the united states to

1298
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,040
legally then intercept and

1299
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,280
use that data

1300
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,800
apps

1301
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,480
that's the biggest threat i think at the

1302
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,559
moment so whenever you get into future

1303
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,520
life app development or protecting

1304
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,520
the way apps are done

1305
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,119
look at it very carefully indeed

1306
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,920
fascinating areas and my sort of last

1307
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,559
thought on this uh is that in the

1308
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,160
ukraine war

1309
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,960
application web application security is

1310
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,520
a matter of life and death

1311
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,079
thanks guys

1312
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,240
[Music]

1313
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,079
i think we've got time for a couple of

1314
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,960
questions if there are any

1315
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,240
oh we've got one one here

1316
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,160
[Music]

1317
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,720
thanks for that that was fantastic um

1318
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,920
just one of the things i'm trying to

1319
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,520
read into that are you almost suggesting

1320
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,680
that russia's technical capability is

1321
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,000
likely to be something that really hurts

1322
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,319
it in future

1323
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,920
that technical capability is something

1324
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,440
that really hurts in the future it will

1325
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,359
hurt russia as this goes on it sounds

1326
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,319
like you're suggesting they're a lot

1327
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,480
less technically advanced or just we're

1328
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,160
not seeing that

1329
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,680
the biggest thing from a technological

1330
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,280
perspective that's hurting russia's

1331
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,079
ability to prosecute the war is their

1332
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,640
lack of access to high-tech the chips

1333
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,079
that they need for the smart weapons to

1334
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,400
be able to replace their arsenals um and

1335
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,839
everything else that's getting damaged

1336
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,160
military kit is very complex and breaks

1337
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,599
frequently if you can't get the spare

1338
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,720
parts for it

1339
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,240
and they can't get the spare parts

1340
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,079
that's why the sanctions are really

1341
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,599
important as well as the effect that

1342
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,880
they'll have on the oligarchs and

1343
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,960
pressure and everything else and they've

1344
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,800
resorted to stealing uh uh steel to

1345
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,119
repair their their vehicles and

1346
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,200
infrastructure because they can't get it

1347
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,520
domestically

1348
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,520
okay folks thank you very much indeed

1349
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,850
pleasure

1350
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,980
[Applause]
