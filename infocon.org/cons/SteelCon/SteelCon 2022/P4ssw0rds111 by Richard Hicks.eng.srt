1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,160
okay so uh let's get started so i've got

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,800
a url at the top there um which i'm

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,320
going to try this see if it works but

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,519
apparently if you go there you should be

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,759
able to ask me some questions later and

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,920
the idea being if we don't have time for

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,520
me to answer them at the end of the talk

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,520
i can go through my laptop and i can

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,119
have a look at and try and get back to

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,960
you with questions or even on twitter or

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,439
whatever tweet out the answers

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,880
so

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,119
passwords

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,720
uh let's go with who am i and why should

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,440
you listen to me at all um but anyway

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
richard hicks is my name uh otherwise

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
known as uh scriptmonkey

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
uh ten plus using offensive security

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,840
doing pen testing last five in

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,840
uh more red teaming stuff attacking more

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,160
financial institutions in the last

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
year or two um in purple teaming for a

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160
large uk insurance company so um and

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
before that if i had to told you i'd

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
have to wake you up afterwards

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,079
government it contracted contracting

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,680
and i happen to like star trek which

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,280
might come across a little bit in this

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,199
presentation so apologies if you're a

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,040
star wars fan

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
i am not an i.t support engineer that is

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,760
not my work pass but it works as one if

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,439
you need it

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,119
you see with an id support lanyard on my

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,560
neck report

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,680
um

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,400
okay so

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,360
okay so a day in a past life

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,000
um in a previous life i used to manage

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,960
the

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,080
um password cracking rig for a large

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,159
security consultancy

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,320
um and that meant

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,040
trying to wrangle like 40 pen testers

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
who all wanted to use a single resource

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,479
to play nicely with each other over this

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,560
limited resource and stuff so this is

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,640
just sort of a typical day so i'd wake

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,159
up in the morning on a monday and go oh

50
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,520
my god

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
then i'd uh have myself some i keep on

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,799
hitting the wrong button

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,960
have myself some coffee or a little

54
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,759
grape tea hot yeah

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,880
and everything would start feeling

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,719
better and i'd settle down to work and

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,240
sometimes call upon my friends to help

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
me out with that work if things got a

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,119
little bit too difficult

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,399
but it's okay because we generally

61
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,799
succeeded a little bit of root dance

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,598
i'm going now check my emails

63
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
about the password tracking rig and i

64
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,920
would see invariably see the rig is

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,720
broken the rig is slow

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,400
oh my goodness

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,879
nothing is working at all etc

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,040
um

69
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,599
and uh the thing is about password

70
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,400
cracking is it's not really

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,160
like recognized as a skill i suppose

72
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
inside of like professional circles it's

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
it's almost assumed knowledge

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
uh to a lot of degree like tall plus

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
word list times rules plus hash list

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
equals plain score right

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,720
but

78
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,080
that'll get you some that'll get you

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,120
results

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,280
but really that's not how this works or

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
it shouldn't be right so it shouldn't be

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,959
how any of this works

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,040
um and that's what my talk is about it's

84
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,760
applying some common sense because

85
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,120
i would invariably log on to the

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
cracking rig and i'd see something like

87
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
this

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,319
um i don't know i don't know if you can

89
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,239
actually read that but

90
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,640
someone set off a job for blowfish or b

91
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,280
crypt yeah that's going to take 41 000

92
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,599
years to complete exhaustively

93
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,800
yeah and it's doing 80 hashes a second

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
like what is the point of running that

95
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,920
dictionary against

96
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
the amount of words you're clearing

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,159
is is next to none in comparison to

98
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,200
where you could be if you were doing

99
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,879
something more intelligent you'd be

100
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
spending your time cracking

101
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,799
um spending your time making educated

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,239
guesses versus

103
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,000
uh a candidate of spring 1990 in 2022 so

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,799
yeah

105
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,519
good old cars reaction there

106
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,840
um so like i said they would come i

107
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
would get emails and they would say

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
everything's ever everything happened

109
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
and invariably i'd be sent a screenshot

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
somebody looks like that line length

111
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
exception

112
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,159
token uh delimiter not found or token

113
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,319
delimiter exception etc

114
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,040
um and i would say

115
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,680
every time i don't think i've found one

116
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,760
time that the rig was at fault it was

117
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,560
because they switched it with hash list

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
in the ordering on the command so just a

119
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,080
gotcha that's quite common or

120
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,879
they're using the wrong um minus m so

121
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,959
the attack uh sorry the hashing mode the

122
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,639
hashing algorithm

123
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,000
is specified by a number in the command

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,320
line they're using the wrong number

125
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
maybe they've copied the command from

126
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,160
when they were previously doing another

127
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,639
hash type and now they've moved from net

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,479
entered mb2

129
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,320
to henceforth straight

130
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,919
um and they've just not updated from

131
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
5600 to a thousand

132
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
um in that case

133
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
i would always end up sending them

134
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,440
normally to the wiki but in more recent

135
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
editions of hashgap you can just run

136
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
hashcat minus minus example hashes and

137
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
get an example

138
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,639
um print out of every hash that they

139
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,960
support

140
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,040
some of the other things i'd see on

141
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
there is people cracking it and not um

142
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
not setting the options to like optimal

143
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,759
values

144
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,600
so um work profile minus w

145
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
the difference between selecting

146
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,880
work profile one which is go gently and

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
work profile 4

148
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,840
here is about

149
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,160
twice the speed on my on my this is all

150
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,759
on my laptop right so this isn't on my

151
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,680
crack so please ignore the numbers in

152
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
terms of like oh

153
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,039
that's quite slow

154
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,639
but it's on my integrated graphics on my

155
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,840
laptop so yeah so i've gone from 1 300

156
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,120
megahash per second to

157
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,680
2582.9

158
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,160
in the benchmark mode just by simply

159
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
adding w4 to the command line and by

160
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,960
default hashcat will do w2 so

161
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,600
profile 2 so not nearly as bad as w1 but

162
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
not as good as w4

163
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,320
there is a gotcha in that

164
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,120
every guess is a gpu cycle

165
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,520
if you hog your gpu and you're running

166
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,000
gui programs say x

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,520
or um

168
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,039
you're expecting like a gui interface to

169
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,039
be reactive

170
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
um you can end up being in a situation

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,639
where it's sort of like browsing by

172
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
powerpoint using that using the pc by

173
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
powerpoint but if you're headless or

174
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,520
you're in there as ssh for example go

175
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,960
for nw4

176
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
um it's been rare

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
that i've seen things like this so but

178
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
i've seen it lock up in quite such a way

179
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
but it can happen

180
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,639
um

181
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,000
and there's something else as well that

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,520
people could keep forgetting about which

183
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
is minus o so

184
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,880
if you see on the left hand side they've

185
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,039
got optimized kernel enabled

186
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:29,919
um

187
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,919
in the center i don't i've not used

188
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,960
minus o in my command line

189
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,199
and even on work profile four

190
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,960
i'm only cracking well less than a

191
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,880
thousand when i was up near two and a

192
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,360
half before so um

193
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,840
yeah it makes a massive difference

194
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,080
sorry trying to struggle to try to

195
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,400
struggle with debris and nerves so

196
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
uh

197
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
sorry

198
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,520
right so

199
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,758
um

200
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
yeah so that's that's with the optimized

201
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,479
kernel there is a trade-off in the

202
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,000
there's a length trade-off with common

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,960
hashes

204
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,360
hashtag will tell you um if you have a

205
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
look at the wiki i can't remember

206
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,240
the number off it's on my head but it's

207
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,080
like i think it's like 32 characters or

208
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,360
longer

209
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
in terms of passwords

210
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,560
the also if you set it and hashcat's

211
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,120
like well this is a slow hash anyway

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
there's no benefit to

213
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
an optimized kernel i'm just going to

214
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,160
use real mode

215
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
then it will tell you and disable it by

216
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,400
default like its own way so it's almost

217
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,679
always worth doing minus

218
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
so

219
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,199
okay we've covered certain pieces

220
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,240
like some of the dirts of hashtag

221
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,599
dictionaries so this is almost like the

222
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,080
main thrust of this talk i suppose

223
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
um and it's to try and get people to

224
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,039
think

225
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,560
in a different way so

226
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,599
we all know

227
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,720
custom dictionaries targeted towards

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,360
your targets your clients are often the

229
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,199
most successful right so

230
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,160
typical sources using cool uh thanks did

231
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,479
you ninja

232
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
there's one here that i use uh which old

233
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
colleague of mine called leaky.pipe

234
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,759
literally just turns any word

235
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,919
into a large uh

236
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
number of mutations of lead speak

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
so typically you know comfortably and

238
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
now throw numbers at the end of it for

239
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
for just a simple quick check

240
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,080
if i've already got access to a network

241
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
then i should be thinking about the

242
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,560
dictionaries

243
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
like building dictionaries as i go so if

244
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,719
i'm as a domain user

245
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,479
why aren't i using names of the

246
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,640
computers and servers that are in there

247
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
so call it from av

248
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,640
get that create a create a word list out

249
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,760
of it

250
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
um there's a load of tools in hashtag

251
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,040
utils

252
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,000
that do things like permutations

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
um it will do combinations of two words

254
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,800
so every word in one list

255
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
with every word in the other list and

256
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
output them and it will even do up to

257
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,920
three um but they give a warning of like

258
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,279
both

259
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,920
uh the combinator side of life and in

260
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,279
crunch

261
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,680
you can completely fill your hard drive

262
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,480
if you if every very quickly if you get

263
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,560
a command and you don't watch it so just

264
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,839
be very careful when you run those

265
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,959
things

266
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,560
but yeah so custom word this is normally

267
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
the way to go

268
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
um

269
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
language specific so this this is

270
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
puzzled a lot of like junior pentesters

271
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
like how do i how do i target like a

272
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,440
german website and it's like well

273
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
most public breaches are international

274
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,720
anyway

275
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
so you'll have german words in there

276
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
anyway but if you really want a german

277
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
dictionary or in this case a welsh

278
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
dictionary

279
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,040
um

280
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,120
sorry i'm welcome yeah

281
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,560
use the resources that you've got to

282
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
hand so a spell is a dictionary on linux

283
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,279
you can black out

284
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
all of the um

285
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
a spell sort of stems with all of the a

286
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
spell

287
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
um

288
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,959
i don't know what you call the end of

289
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,800
the word the endings

290
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
of the words

291
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
into a into a text file and all of a

292
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,480
sudden it's not necessarily all the

293
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
words like i'm pretty sure some of those

294
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,760
words are not welsh like they're

295
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,839
complete nonsense but

296
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,760
it just basically puts all the stems of

297
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,839
words with the endings so all the leaves

298
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,079
the heads etc

299
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,680
but you end up with a nice list of

300
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,880
mostly

301
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,320
the language that you're looking for

302
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
the size matters right so

303
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
bigger isn't always better

304
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
when you're when you're testing a

305
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
corporate environment

306
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,920
say for example

307
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
consider the case rather

308
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,640
there's a guest wi-fi network

309
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,200
for i don't know acne corp down the road

310
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,160
they're using wpa2 psk it's just a guest

311
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,519
network they just want to secure it so

312
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,440
they don't get randoms on there

313
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,160
um are they likely to use

314
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,519
curse words

315
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,040
budget you know sugar whatever yeah

316
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,920
um in their password they're not right

317
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,040
so why am i testing 25 000 of damn

318
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,760
things against the slow hash right

319
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,399
because wpa2 is pretty slow in the grand

320
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
scheme of things now we're near like you

321
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,240
know as fast as empty by the way

322
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,600
so

323
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,079
maybe i need to be considering maybe i

324
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,440
just filter out the stuff i'm not

325
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
interested in out of my dictionaries

326
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,360
before i go and

327
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,600
set them up to crack

328
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,040
that said in a d maybe someone would put

329
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,240
i hate my

330
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
job yeah so it might be worth keeping

331
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
them i don't know it's up to you it's

332
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,760
your call

333
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,399
uh public dumps they're full of garbage

334
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,040
so this is me looking for the source

335
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,240
attribute very common attribute in html

336
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
and this is out of just a raw rock

337
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
you've done and you can see

338
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,519
like who's really going to set their

339
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,480
passwords to a line of html they're not

340
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,360
um okay you may get your developer maybe

341
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
that's just been a bit weird um for the

342
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,160
odd pen testers then tickle one equals

343
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,839
one that is a bold move if you're doing

344
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,160
that on a password uh change form by the

345
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,959
way

346
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,480
doing that on an update

347
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,240
danger right so

348
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,200
um

349
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
but either way

350
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,079
it's not really something that i'm

351
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,079
interested in and i've controlled see

352
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,600
that right because i didn't want a full

353
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,079
full like list of it

354
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,800
there's loads of it in rock u and

355
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,760
problem is rocky isn't the only one so

356
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
crap station

357
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,360
stuff is the same issue you've got image

358
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,399
tags

359
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,240
it's got it's weirdly formatted and i

360
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,160
think um

361
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,079
that's down to just uh

362
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,760
character i suppose like non-characters

363
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,800
or unico characters um getting in the

364
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,279
way but you can still see this html in

365
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,399
there

366
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,480
i don't want that in my dictionaries

367
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,639
so maybe it's worth cleaning um

368
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
and the problem that popular wordpress

369
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,920
have

370
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,240
is the problem multiplies so

371
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,639
people-based projects

372
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,839
off of

373
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,120
common wordless we've got rocky 2021 in

374
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,000
there

375
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,320
massive compendium of words of words

376
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,959
created from all these public dumps yeah

377
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,720
great i can guarantee you there's loads

378
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,399
of html in it there's loads of stuff

379
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,440
that's irrelevant for me as a as a pen

380
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
tester doing normal jobs

381
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,920
for cracking like corporate passwords um

382
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,519
and security companies including my last

383
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,639
employer so

384
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,880
apologies if i'm sort of like dumping on

385
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
a little bit but uh

386
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,880
security companies are no

387
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,480
stranger to this either

388
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,880
they take stuff base it on classic rock

389
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,760
you

390
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,839
and you can guarantee that it suffers

391
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,320
the same issues rocktastic 12a is a

392
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
really popular word list at least in my

393
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
circles um

394
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,240
for cracking it's really massive yeah so

395
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,199
it's like

396
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,560
1.1 billion words 13 gigabytes in size

397
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
it's huge

398
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,560
and it will get you don't get me wrong

399
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,519
right

400
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,440
these word lists will get you cracked

401
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,839
they will get you passwords

402
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,120
but will they get you them as fast as

403
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,440
you know doing a bit of a smarter move

404
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,199
having having clean dictionaries before

405
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,639
you go in

406
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,600
before you start engaging

407
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,440
um

408
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
adding rule sets you get problems

409
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,440
uh

410
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,480
i would i suppose um

411
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,279
so we look at this i just pick password

412
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,959
as an arbitrary thing and to be honest

413
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,600
hashcat does do some weak password um

414
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
guesses itself uh without being in the

415
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,760
dictionary or do some

416
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
some base guesses so i think

417
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
a password should feature inside of that

418
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
but um just for argument's sake let's

419
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,360
see where the position of the lowercase

420
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,320
password first appears in rocktastic 12a

421
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,040
well it appears 168 million

422
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,079
words in

423
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,320
all right so without the rules of being

424
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,199
applied here you've already done 168

425
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,040
million guesses against whatever hash

426
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
you're trying before you've tested the

427
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,399
word password

428
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,839
against it

429
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,120
um it appears again then for some reason

430
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
i think i know why

431
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,639
but it does duplicate yourself inside

432
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,720
this list so i'm not only doing it once

433
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,680
i'm doing it twice so slowly down twice

434
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,519
crack station's not no different in fact

435
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,839
it's worse position in the

436
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,440
technically in terms of like where it is

437
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,000
from the top which is 891 million words

438
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
in yeah so now bear in mind password is

439
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
not that

440
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,279
not likely

441
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,000
to be someone's actual password

442
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,440
i hope not in these days but

443
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
i have seen in corporate environments

444
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,720
still today where password with a zero

445
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,240
exclamation mark and a couple of ones

446
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
after it is

447
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
so

448
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,199
before my mutations applied

449
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,040
um i'm still doing 891 million guesses

450
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
before he even gets that one

451
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
if we have rule sets in

452
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,880
so we take blocktastic 12a as an example

453
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,920
so 168 million words in i had a rule set

454
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,360
of dive so that's 99 092 rules of

455
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,120
mutators

456
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,199
in total and we make an assumption here

457
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,399
right so

458
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,000
just for illustration so you can make

459
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,800
the assumption that all rules in dive

460
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,519
are valid mutations of

461
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,600
the word password it's not the case

462
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,880
absolutely not the case or valid

463
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,040
mutations of the words before password

464
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,199
rather it's not the case it's going to

465
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,720
be a lower number

466
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,639
but just because i'm rubbish at maths

467
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,639
let's just keep the numbers simple

468
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,320
i was

469
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,920
trillion guesses before we guess the

470
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,199
word password

471
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,079
um

472
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,560
against our target hash

473
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,880
now that might not matter if you're

474
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
doing something like

475
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,560
md5 ntlm md4 etc they're really really

476
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,639
fast hashes to crack you've got gpu

477
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,000
cycles to spare

478
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,519
go at it

479
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,040
but the moment you start getting away

480
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,839
from that you start going to

481
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,759
slower hash forms

482
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,920
then that's where things make a massive

483
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,199
difference so

484
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,880
like we saw earlier where we saw someone

485
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,639
trying to crack vcrypt

486
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,560
we're talking you know

487
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
the heat depth of the universe before we

488
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
start testing the word password against

489
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
our hash

490
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
um

491
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
it gets worse

492
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,280
if you consider context so

493
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,480
we are now in 2022. um what is the

494
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
likelihood that someone will have a

495
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,599
password of spring 1990 to spring 1999

496
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,119
because the first 10 passwords of

497
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,359
rocktastic are those

498
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,559
so if again if we multiply and consider

499
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,280
that they're all valid transformations

500
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,919
um i'm wasting 43 seconds of my hash

501
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,400
rate of wpa2 on my laptop

502
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
all right

503
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,120
43 seconds nothing in the grand scheme

504
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,960
things

505
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,919
that's the end of 100 passwords into

506
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,799
blocktastic i'm still testing seasons

507
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,240
and years

508
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,880
we're still they only go up to 2015

509
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
because that's when rock plastic was

510
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,039
made

511
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,600
so they don't test anything beyond that

512
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,880
so

513
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
now i've actually wasted 430 seconds so

514
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,240
over five minutes yeah to test

515
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
100 passwords that probably aren't going

516
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,039
to hit

517
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,480
again

518
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,880
this doesn't say they won't hit but it

519
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,559
might be unlikely that they would hit

520
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,600
based on the target that you're

521
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,919
targeting

522
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,640
so

523
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
let's change the paradigm well they're

524
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
going to do that business view so you

525
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
need words

526
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,960
not word lists

527
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
what i mean by that is you need to be

528
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,160
able to curate your word list into

529
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,480
individual you need to basically clean

530
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,880
them up you need to remove the garbage

531
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,919
you need to uh dedupe them not only in

532
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,600
themselves because you'll see uh

533
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
duplicates of words in in individual

534
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,679
wordpress

535
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,600
but you need to dedupe them across your

536
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,440
entire

537
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,080
number of word lists so that at the end

538
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,360
you have one

539
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,840
one list of individually unique words

540
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,080
and hopefully a lot of them um

541
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,320
rather than focusing on oh i cracked it

542
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
as part of rock you oh i cracked it as

543
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,000
part of weak past v2 et cetera et cetera

544
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,320
and there is clearly a need especially

545
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
if you're doing more than like the

546
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,320
faster hashes to do maintenance and it's

547
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
not an easy task and it's not a quick

548
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,520
job

549
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,679
and you've got to keep on top of it

550
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,480
so

551
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,320
um what are some of the issues we have

552
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,880
with doing this uh maintenance and

553
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,039
and things it is

554
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,960
darn it i didn't find my thing right

555
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,000
um

556
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,280
so one of the ones that you come across

557
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,200
is locale

558
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
um just like the meme says it's a

559
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,600
universal translator broken again

560
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
locale is how a computer system

561
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,919
understands the characters

562
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,559
in a file

563
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,400
and you'll see the

564
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,600
characters are encoded differently

565
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,280
depending on the look out of the system

566
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
so engb for example

567
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,880
isn't going to necessarily worry about

568
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
unlocks on their characters yeah but d d

569
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,400
utf-8 will do

570
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,919
and there will be differences between

571
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,400
the two so if we take this example

572
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,440
i've done a sort and a unique rocky.text

573
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
and i've thrown into a text file

574
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,919
i've then fixed the

575
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,240
locale on a specific locale and done a

576
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,120
sort minus u to rocky.txt and send that

577
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
to a text file and i said hey

578
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
there shouldn't be any differences

579
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,039
but can you give me the differences out

580
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,280
of those files sure enough i've got

581
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,600
differences now those are like showing

582
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,360
up as weird characters that's unicode i

583
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,159
guess

584
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,120
um

585
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
and it makes sense that those would be

586
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
in a different order because that's what

587
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,480
would have been affected by the lookout

588
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
change um so we can see

589
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,678
that if we don't do this

590
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,039
and our order because a lot of a lot of

591
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
future follow-on tools depend on lists

592
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,400
being sorted

593
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,640
so if they're not sorted what you end up

594
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,520
doing

595
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,320
is

596
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,640
you end up either the tool ignores it or

597
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,799
it won't accept it or you'll break it'll

598
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,480
result in unexpected behavior

599
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,120
and if i'd read the manual it tells you

600
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,039
this straight away in the man page for

601
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,240
sort

602
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,799
set lc autistic um

603
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,039
because otherwise you won't do it won't

604
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,840
do native by values comparisons that

605
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,240
will use the characters

606
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
so

607
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
we've got a solution now to do all of

608
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,720
our passwords kind of sorting words

609
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,679
well sort of yeah so example command lc

610
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,120
or seesaw

611
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,360
i use a few extra extra commands or

612
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,400
extra switches

613
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
to sort of speed it up so i thought to

614
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,640
spawn four parallel processes because

615
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,480
that's what how many cores i wanted to

616
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,320
use on my system

617
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,480
i asked it to limit memory buffers per

618
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,559
process to four gigabytes

619
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,720
i asked it to unique and i asked it to

620
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,320
put it to a file

621
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,799
and then i went to bed

622
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,799
and i woke up in the morning

623
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,039
and it was yoon killer so

624
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,480
what's in killer out of memory killer so

625
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
unkiller who gets invoked on a learning

626
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,919
system anyway

627
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,320
um whenever it's a critically low or

628
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,520
over re over allocated memory on a

629
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,200
system so

630
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,240
sort

631
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,200
uh it tries to be nice i've set i've set

632
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,039
rules on it to be nice yeah i'll only

633
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,039
take up four gig et cetera

634
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,000
um

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,880
but

636
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
if your system in normal usage outside

637
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,919
of the sort job that's going on runs out

638
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,960
of memory

639
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,240
it's going to look like one heck of a

640
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,159
tasty process for mean killer to come

641
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,799
along and go huh he's arguing a lot i'll

642
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,880
get rid of him

643
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,559
and and it will and then you'll wake up

644
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,280
and be super sad

645
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,320
okay so how do we get around that

646
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,240
well there's nothing

647
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,039
nothing for it but split we need to

648
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,640
split up

649
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,600
uh large large words into more workable

650
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,039
wordless

651
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,640
if you think about it sorts trying to

652
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
load the entire word that's into memory

653
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,679
and then it's trying to do that then

654
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,320
he's trying to do a sorting uh operation

655
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,919
which i can only imagine involves

656
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,440
multiple arrays

657
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,520
um so multiple copies of the same data

658
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,120
in memory

659
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,799
i guess in some way i'm sure there's

660
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,720
optimizations there but it takes up a

661
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,840
lot

662
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,200
um

663
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
and so the only approach you can do is

664
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,200
split the file so here i

665
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,440
before you even try sorting rocktastic

666
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,000
12a i decided to split it out and i've

667
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
done it arbitrarily i've just taken hey

668
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,159
give me a line count

669
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,200
and you can do split based on bite size

670
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,120
but it doesn't preserve line ending so

671
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,640
you don't want to like chop your

672
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,039
password candidates in half right

673
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,200
so you do it via lines

674
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
that's the easiest way of doing it

675
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,720
and all i did was take the total value

676
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
and i went ah you know what 100 files

677
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,200
it's workable i can do that it's a bit

678
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,039
of scripting but it's all right

679
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,120
so i just divided by 100 so i've got 11

680
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,559
million lines 11 million passwords

681
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,520
in every single one of the files

682
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,360
and that creates 100 files

683
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,520
so straight away these things are more

684
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
workable

685
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,799
so i can sort in unique

686
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,559
each one of these files

687
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,799
i can sort in unique between them etc

688
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,039
etc but that's a lot of work that's a

689
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,320
lot of effort

690
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,039
and a lot a lot of bash groups

691
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,080
um

692
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,960
if only there was another way

693
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,120
sinusoidal prime developed a tool based

694
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,039
upon two tools inside of a hashtag

695
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,279
youtube it's called rni and rli too

696
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,320
i like remove list or remove line

697
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,679
um that's what i think it stands for

698
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,679
so they made remove line ng or remove

699
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,520
less ng

700
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,679
it can deduce single files so you can do

701
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,279
the sorting and unique

702
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,039
it can remove words based on a single

703
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,880
list so if you wanted to get rid of

704
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,400
swear words or whatever out of there you

705
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,679
could have a list of swear words and try

706
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,200
it on that

707
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,120
but yeah you can sort of unique files

708
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,559
across directories so you can have your

709
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,080
large mega

710
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,720
amazingly clean and targeted wordness

711
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,039
or a series of them in one file and then

712
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,880
literally when you get a new dump a new

713
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,200
public leak or something comes out or a

714
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,039
new source of passwords

715
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,559
you can go hey

716
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,960
rling

717
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,720
here's a new file i want to import into

718
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,200
my my mega word list

719
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,919
can you tell me on remove any words i

720
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,520
already know about and then just add the

721
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,799
ones i need

722
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,480
yeah

723
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,520
so if we do that and i try this

724
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,640
against the split out rocktastic 1280

725
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,279
and here all i'm doing is i'm taking the

726
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,520
first 11 million

727
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
passwords

728
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,559
and saying hey

729
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,080
can you put

730
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,120
any

731
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,159
that do not exist in any of the other

732
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,640
parts of rocktastic 12a so i'm comparing

733
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,120
it against the other 99 files

734
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,360
and saying put the unique ones in a file

735
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,400
for me

736
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,960
and then i'll do that for all 99 files

737
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
and i should have at the end of it a

738
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
file with nothing but clean

739
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,840
single unique

740
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,919
words and i do it

741
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,880
and we see at the end it's removed 4.9

742
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,559
million words

743
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,960
from the 11 million i started with

744
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,120
because they already appear

745
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,600
somewhere else in onetastic

746
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,400
so

747
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,080
the password thing was kind of like a

748
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,760
teller but

749
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
if we look harder how much time we're

750
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,159
wasting per word

751
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,640
4.9 million in the first 11

752
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
of testing

753
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,640
words we've already tested inside of the

754
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,279
same word list is a bit mental um

755
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,480
so yeah so

756
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
the need to kind of like prune and clean

757
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,360
up

758
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,919
uh where this is huge

759
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,880
um

760
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,320
and here we've got

761
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,080
what i what i said earlier is like so

762
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,720
okay say rocktastic 12a is my gold word

763
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,080
list

764
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,000
and i get rocky.txt and i'm like hey you

765
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,440
know what i just want all the words i

766
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
don't know about the rock you i don't

767
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,840
know about to be added and it's found

768
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,200
three thousand three thousand words

769
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,840
that aren't in rocktastic 12a

770
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,279
and if you look at the words they're

771
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,720
actually all the special characters are

772
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,799
all like unicode etcetera and that's why

773
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,840
i suspect when not tastic 12a was solid

774
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,480
and unique that locale was the issue and

775
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
locale just like

776
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,919
that that issue caused them to drop it

777
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,039
on the floor

778
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,840
so

779
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,440
uh so i've just regained 3000 words but

780
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,120
i haven't imported 14 million

781
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,520
the words i already knew about

782
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,399
um

783
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,279
so yeah so

784
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,000
this is one of the biggest excuses i

785
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,240
used to get back when i was in uh in

786
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,200
there

787
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,880
was oh but it works right i don't deny i

788
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,919
do not deny big wordless crack hashes

789
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,919
right you'd they have to is it

790
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,640
scientifically impossible for it not to

791
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,520
like be somewhat successful

792
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,679
um i ain't got time to change dicks and

793
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,120
stuff i've got i've got work to do i've

794
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,799
got to do actual like pen testing

795
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,480
password cracking meh whatever i just

796
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,080
gotta get on and start doing the hacker

797
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,120
planning

798
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,159
um

799
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
the problem is is this time

800
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,240
doesn't necessarily have to be out of

801
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,640
your engagement it could be done

802
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,039
it could be done as like a precursor to

803
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,120
this stuff if you organize your

804
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,360
word list in advance

805
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,600
then you already have

806
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,960
um

807
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,120
a good start in terms of optimizing the

808
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,360
attack so you're not spending as long

809
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,120
cracking passwords

810
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,279
you've got more time to do your job

811
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,000
or do the actual hacking or the fun bit

812
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,159
um and you'll get results hopefully

813
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,480
quicker over time

814
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,840
and one of the ways you can do this if

815
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,200
you've already prepped in advance with

816
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,960
your word lists is

817
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,159
use sim links right and use alphabet so

818
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,919
alphabetically order them there's some

819
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,799
links in the folder and you glob in

820
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,039
because hashtag will support it and use

821
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,039
a star at the end so

822
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,960
hashtag now will automatically go

823
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,799
through my test dictionary folder and go

824
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,200
a b c and it will just test those word

825
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,760
lists in that order so i could

826
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,520
i could prioritize all of my custom

827
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,880
dictionaries i've got i'm not going to

828
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,640
bother running like you know dupe or

829
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,720
whatever on the custom dictionaries

830
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,399
but i could do all the custom

831
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,799
dictionaries and at the end i can go hey

832
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,360
you know i'll take my lovely

833
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,880
curated

834
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,799
well-ordered word list and chuck that at

835
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,720
the end because it's massive but throw

836
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,159
that in and see what we can get

837
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,039
so summing up garbage in equals garbage

838
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,039
out we need to split our word list into

839
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,720
a smaller list there's no penalty for

840
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,880
that because we need job into to get

841
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,320
them back

842
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,559
um eliminate stupid words but not just

843
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,840
in the dictionaries but against

844
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,880
everything

845
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,399
and we need to focus the dictionaries at

846
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,679
the target so we need to apply some

847
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,520
intelligence about what are we trying to

848
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,480
crack

849
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,039
what do we think it would be and is it

850
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,880
suited like is there any point in me

851
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,559
trying to spanish dictionary against

852
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,640
the uk government

853
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,240
website or something i don't know

854
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,919
i mean trying to target it more to you

855
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,120
to your target

856
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,000
and remember to fix your lookout

857
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,880
so

858
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,960
we covered straight mode

859
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,039
in hash cap but hashtag support support

860
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,880
is one of the most common most issues is

861
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,480
masks as well

862
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,120
and it's very very common

863
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,520
to see someone just do question mark a

864
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,399
bunch of times in this case eight times

865
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,320
and in this in this command we can see

866
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,240
one they've missed out minus minus

867
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,760
increment so the only thing they're

868
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,480
testing is all eight character words

869
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,000
that could be made out of the question

870
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,919
mark a

871
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,279
character set

872
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,279
what does question mark a mean

873
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,080
well it means lower upper digit and

874
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,880
special right it's a special

875
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,960
master that relates to that

876
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
the special is in what you think is

877
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,919
necessary

878
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,760
especially is very american

879
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,559
so

880
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,240
special contains those characters and

881
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,080
those characters alone

882
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,720
it doesn't contain a parent's name

883
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,960
well it contains a hash i suppose that's

884
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,320
an american household but it doesn't

885
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,159
contain the pound sterling sign it

886
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,559
doesn't contain the euro currency sign

887
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,519
um and it doesn't contain upside down

888
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,679
question marks upside down uh

889
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,080
exclamation marks etc

890
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,840
so how do we get around that well we can

891
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,120
specify custom masks so we can say hey

892
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,880
you know what i'm going to make my own

893
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,720
special character set

894
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,960
i'm going to set use minus one

895
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,039
um specify the first map first custom

896
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,760
mask and then instead of doing

897
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,919
question mark and all of these things

898
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,640
i could even use -2 and say hey do you

899
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,000
lower upper digit and then do one

900
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,039
yeah to get all of my special characters

901
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,799
um or

902
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,240
hashtag knows this is an issue and they

903
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,039
provide quite graciously uh

904
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,080
common

905
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,559
character sets for common languages

906
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,640
already in their child sets folder so

907
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,000
you can add

908
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,159
special characters from these uh

909
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,440
character sets

910
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,559
to your masks

911
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,480
so

912
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,640
just an example of like the efficiency

913
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,960
of masks and like how powerful they are

914
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,880
so password one exclamation mark max or

915
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,679
mac mastered when you seven l's so

916
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,000
lowercase one digit one special but

917
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,279
sodas

918
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,760
and collapse three at

919
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
um it would be found by the same mask

920
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,440
yeah so i find all the weak passwords

921
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,279
from password one or

922
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,480
uh whatever

923
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
plus i also find a password that would

924
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,919
probably never feature as part of a

925
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,360
dictionary

926
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,279
um

927
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,799
that master bug

928
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,399
is number 11

929
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,039
in the net spy top 40 masters in 2015

930
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,880
which is a resource i'll put a link in

931
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,960
my presentation and if you need a link

932
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,320
sent to you

933
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,919
let me know i'll send it um it's really

934
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,279
good nice list 40 40 mass time sorted

935
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,880
quickest to slowest

936
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,039
um that gives me real good hits

937
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,960
utility of them so i mentioned about

938
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,320
country specific attacks you can use a

939
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,000
hybrid attack so you can use minus six

940
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,240
which will prefix it a mask to addiction

941
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,559
to a ditch all addiction words you use

942
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,399
minus seven which will uh um suffix the

943
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,799
mask to every dictionary word so say you

944
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,000
wanted to just test the year 2022 you

945
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,159
can set up a mask to do that and then

946
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,200
run all your dictionary words with

947
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,720
2022 added on the end pretty easily um

948
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,679
it can also make a difference with

949
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,399
country specific attacks or perhaps like

950
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,519
i said use the um already provided

951
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,799
character sets

952
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,960
and use it to append extra special

953
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,399
characters at the end if you want

954
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
there's some curios about it so

955
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,760
the default mat if you don't if you

956
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,600
forget and i've done this and i know

957
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,120
others have done this

958
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,679
if you forget to give a mask and you're

959
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,440
in attack mode three

960
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,840
hashtag will take your hashes and

961
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,159
hashtag will look incredibly busy and it

962
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,000
will quite happily spend the next six

963
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,159
hours cracking away

964
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,600
on 15 character passwords of that format

965
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
you don't get an error you just

966
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,519
it just goes yeah i've started the crack

967
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,320
job

968
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,559
you get six hours of probably worthless

969
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,320
cracking because it's doing the 50

970
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,519
character

971
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,360
mask of that of that construction

972
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,960
so just be aware about if you are doing

973
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,280
minus a3 make sure you specify a mask at

974
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,719
the end of it or you'll regret it so um

975
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,199
there's the two urls for next fight

976
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,918
really good resources also corelogic

977
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,440
they published a hundred of the most

978
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,839
common mass uh masks they've uh

979
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,159
generated using there was a darpa

980
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,839
project as it was

981
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,679
called pathwell there's an interesting

982
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,440
talk on that as well on that website

983
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,359
probably worth checking out equally

984
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,239
hashtag comes with default um like ad

985
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,320
default complexity masks

986
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,040
as part of the hashtag release so like

987
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,480
you know the one upper one lower one

988
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,399
digit one special

989
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,560
it's already got masks for that

990
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,719
um so that'd be cool generate your own

991
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,359
so generating them uh there's a tool

992
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,440
called pack that's analysis correct

993
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,560
toolkit

994
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,079
super important to keep a record of your

995
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,599
planes

996
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,720
and uh just checking time oh well

997
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
okay so it's super important to keep a

998
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,839
record of your planes if you're doing

999
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,079
this when i say planes i mean the

1000
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,839
passwords that you've successfully

1001
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,960
cracked okay your plain texts

1002
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,359
um they're the commands that you use so

1003
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,760
you basically feed your plain texts

1004
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,839
into statsgen which generates some

1005
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,520
statistics around it

1006
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,599
such as most common character etc

1007
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,359
positioning and things

1008
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,040
you feed that output into mask generator

1009
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,079
and it will output a hdmask file now one

1010
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,480
of the lovely things with match gen

1011
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,760
is

1012
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,400
you can benchmark you use the benchmark

1013
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,079
mode in hashcat

1014
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,760
to get your maximum

1015
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,920
hashes per second or ppf so i can't

1016
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,520
remember what that represents frames per

1017
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,920
second maybe and that's you

1018
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,440
put that number

1019
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,200
into pps

1020
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,520
when you do your math gen start pi and

1021
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,680
give it a target time

1022
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,960
3600 is 3600 seconds or one hour

1023
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,599
and it will generate every mask

1024
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,640
in

1025
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,280
fastest to slowest order that it thinks

1026
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,760
that my rig with that benchmark speed

1027
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,440
can crack or cover exhaustively within

1028
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,960
that time period

1029
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,040
so if i'm at the end of the engagement i

1030
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
know i've got another three hours left

1031
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,000
on this job i could do target time

1032
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,400
uh it's gonna be fun three i'm not going

1033
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,359
to do that um

1034
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,560
um if you do take your time specify the

1035
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,680
target time

1036
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,200
and um

1037
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,440
have it generate the masks for me it's

1038
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,839
pretty quick as far as i'm aware um

1039
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,040
and then

1040
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,599
set my cracking going yeah and i know

1041
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,160
that i should get a good clearance of

1042
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,839
i've at least

1043
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,359
applied some form of statistical

1044
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,119
analysis uh

1045
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,560
to my approach of cracking these

1046
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,839
passwords rather than just flinging

1047
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,760
rocky at it um

1048
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,440
how to use it

1049
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,359
instead of specifying question mark

1050
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,680
specify the file maybe the html

1051
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,320
what is hashes

1052
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,480
uh genuine quote there

1053
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,359
um

1054
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,119
so

1055
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,880
what happens if you've got hash that you

1056
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,280
do not know what it is so i know you pop

1057
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,720
the web shell

1058
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,000
web app rather

1059
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,119
you've done the database you've got a

1060
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,119
bunch of hashtags no idea well hashtag's

1061
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,040
got an identified function so what that

1062
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,400
does it will run

1063
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
every parser in hashcat against the

1064
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
hashes that you've got

1065
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,000
and it will return any that accept what

1066
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,520
you've fed it

1067
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,000
so i mean just start off a 10.

1068
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,400
i can tell you right now that

1069
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,040
none of the hashes i fed it were

1070
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,400
my sequel 4.1 or admin 2

1071
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,800
they were all md4 md5

1072
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,000
but

1073
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,079
so it mixed results but at least gives

1074
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,480
you a start for 10. um

1075
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,200
something better though

1076
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,359
and the x fine so

1077
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,880
again

1078
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
that's from sinusoidal prime or rather

1079
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,359
actually i think waffle uh cracking name

1080
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,560
as well because it looks like i've just

1081
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,839
said tag what form but anyway

1082
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,520
um waffle created a tool called mdx

1083
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,400
final

1084
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,839
nbx find is

1085
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,920
it's designed to run

1086
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,000
massive numbers of unsolved hashes that

1087
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,640
you have no idea what they are against

1088
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,480
very large word lists

1089
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,320
and it effectively brute forces

1090
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,880
algorithms in a parallel way

1091
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
so i think it supports over 500

1092
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,320
algorithms

1093
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,400
um and it does that massively parallel

1094
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,480
it is cpu band

1095
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,520
but if you think of it like hash cat or

1096
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,920
and the x-fine cracks algorithms

1097
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,880
so

1098
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
what is that 32-car

1099
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,240
headstring no idea right md4 md5 ntlm

1100
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,200
who knows

1101
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,920
um well mdx fine will know

1102
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,760
so i fed it a bunch of random hashes on

1103
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,079
the side there and we can see

1104
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,040
i've sent it uh a word list i actually

1105
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,720
sent it against rocky and completed

1106
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,680
pretty fast you see it's identified mp5

1107
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,440
and d4 sha-1 sharp 256 and

1108
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,040
and you think oh well that's it that's

1109
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,200
five hashes i think but it's also found

1110
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,640
six seven eight oh that's yeah uh

1111
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
it's carried on all right

1112
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,280
it will return anything that it's able

1113
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,000
to resolve to a genuine word so it's

1114
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,200
done mtl11 but it's also reported that

1115
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,280
that hash ecc

1116
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,480
is nd4 utf-16 which anyone who knows

1117
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,960
what mtlm is that's ntlm that's the

1118
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,119
format of ntlm

1119
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,520
so it reports it twice once

1120
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,119
md5 rev so it's even reversed the hash

1121
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,960
in the case that maybe the hash itself

1122
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,720
is modified

1123
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,040
um and it's and it's returned the

1124
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,280
password it knows backwards but it's

1125
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,720
return that oh yeah it matches against

1126
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,440
md5 reversed shah when reverse

1127
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,680
it'll do things like shah when truncated

1128
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,400
or shot 256 or 512 truncated so if it's

1129
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,560
just chopped off it'll still try um

1130
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,480
it'll do things like

1131
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,160
uh md5 inside of shah one inside of shah

1132
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,800
256 inside of

1133
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,960
name yet nania hashing algorithm it will

1134
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,680
iterate hashing algorithms over

1135
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,280
algorithms

1136
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,960
so my thoughts are with this is if you

1137
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,480
pop a website

1138
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
and you can create a user account

1139
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,920
you create a user account with a

1140
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,839
password of whatever you want it's like

1141
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,440
a canary token

1142
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,200
you take the hash once you've gone in

1143
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,880
and you've got your db done once you've

1144
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,720
created a user account

1145
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,319
take your hash

1146
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,400
you take the word you set it to

1147
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,640
and then you go hey mdxfind go find me

1148
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,240
the actual algorithm that's being used

1149
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,280
here

1150
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,560
and it will come back pretty quick

1151
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,560
um like i said is cpu bound and as cool

1152
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,400
as that is it's not a hashtag john

1153
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,800
replacement um

1154
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
it's very it's just another tool in your

1155
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,760
arsenal to be wearing to be aware of

1156
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,640
command and and the documentation for

1157
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,359
this is terrible in the there's very

1158
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,800
little out there it's very geared

1159
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,480
towards correct me if you can challenge

1160
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,119
output which is slightly different i

1161
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,640
suppose mindset

1162
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,160
um this quite difficult to get to

1163
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
richard i'll give you a rundown of this

1164
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,520
this is like the

1165
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,440
basic command that's on most tutorials

1166
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,640
you find out there

1167
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,000
but i'll give you a quick rundown of

1168
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,960
this so

1169
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,920
um

1170
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,720
minus h or means hey and the x minus try

1171
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,560
all your known hashing algorithms any

1172
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,960
supported hashing algorithms try more

1173
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,200
but you can stack them up right so i

1174
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,440
then do minus h but it goes ah but don't

1175
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,280
do any that are salted so i'm not

1176
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,119
passing a salt file in

1177
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,319
salt.text don't do any salted hashes

1178
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,599
don't do any username hashes so some

1179
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,599
certain hashing algorithms can mess with

1180
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,599
like users and assaults or put solvent

1181
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,119
users together in different ways et

1182
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,280
cetera and the xbox can cope with that

1183
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,400
but i don't want to deal with that right

1184
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,200
now

1185
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,040
don't try that md5x is any

1186
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,440
nested md5 so

1187
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,200
for example

1188
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,359
if the hashing algorithm

1189
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,280
that it hits it could do like

1190
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,079
md5 inside of md5 up to five times for

1191
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,880
example yeah but i've asked it to

1192
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,280
iterate five times

1193
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,200
which then means it's doing md5 inside

1194
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,800
of md5 five times times five

1195
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,720
so that could take up a lot of computing

1196
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,960
power a lot of turning so i'm not

1197
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,359
interested in nd5 and mp5 multiple

1198
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,680
multiple times and i think the minus i5

1199
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,640
will take care of md5 in md5

1200
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,720
uh itself without needing to consider it

1201
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,119
as a special hashing algorithm itself

1202
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,040
and the same with crypt anyone familiar

1203
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,200
with unix crypt for example is literally

1204
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,640
nd5

1205
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,119
multiplied thousands of times

1206
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,760
um i've skipped all of those algorithms

1207
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,119
in this case

1208
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,000
mine is f give it a hash file

1209
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,599
and then give it a dictionary of words

1210
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,599
that i wanted to go against

1211
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,680
um

1212
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,599
yeah

1213
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,960
so evolve or get better at stuff

1214
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,680
uh where i find all this information

1215
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,390
forms on hashcat

1216
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,760
[Music]

1217
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,440
loads of crap if you can challenges and

1218
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,280
the hobbyists hang out on there

1219
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,960
netbooks.com has written that net knox

1220
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,560
has written a couple of good books on

1221
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,480
hash cracking they've got strategies in

1222
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,560
there they discuss prints

1223
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,040
they discuss uh things like purple rain

1224
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,720
attacks but trusted set and things like

1225
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,480
that so they discuss more

1226
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,720
strategization around how to crack past

1227
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,880
uh passwords

1228
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,680
uh it's really worth a read um blog.sun

1229
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,359
is your prime.com they do write ups when

1230
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,800
they do crack me huge fan challenges and

1231
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,119
you find little snippets of oh that's

1232
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,040
all i didn't know know about before such

1233
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,319
as arling

1234
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,200
or rli ng

1235
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,640
one of the websites i get some

1236
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,200
dictionaries from wpa7.org

1237
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,760
he specializes in wpa2

1238
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,920
cracking uh handshakes and he publishes

1239
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,359
some of his dictionaries one of the ones

1240
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,599
i really like is the wikipedia em

1241
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,280
it's got apparently an english dump of

1242
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,560
wikipedia

1243
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,520
in the dictionary was quite nice

1244
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,040
rick um so unfortunately many many

1245
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,400
months ago went offline and i had to

1246
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,160
come back it might come back if it does

1247
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,640
come back it was an amazing resource the

1248
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,000
public dumps

1249
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,880
both

1250
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,680
found planes so you could

1251
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,040
give your word there you could generate

1252
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,960
your wordless from it and

1253
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,280
hash lists that aren't found yet

1254
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,920
um you know hashes that aren't found and

1255
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,359
were listed there so it was good to

1256
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,920
practice and play about with really sad

1257
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,359
that it's gone actually that's quite

1258
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,560
quite a loss

1259
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,599
um

1260
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,359
if you're going to do mdx find there's a

1261
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,920
bible being written by a chat called

1262
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,319
xerox line or xerox ellen

1263
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,319
dot pw um

1264
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,240
go and have a look at that

1265
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,440
that'll talk you through some more

1266
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,000
advanced uh methods of using it

1267
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,079
there's also videos out there by win xp

1268
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,520
5421 giving talks in america with mdx

1269
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,680
find et cetera so you may get some more

1270
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,599
information that way

1271
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,280
uh one of the things i do once i do all

1272
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,800
my password cracking is a bit of

1273
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,359
analysis so another shout out to the uh

1274
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,200
founder or one of the founders of seocon

1275
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,920
did you ninja with his pitbull toolkit

1276
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,000
it's usually expandable

1277
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,400
i myself have checkers custom checkers

1278
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,440
myself

1279
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,839
based on the company i work for so you

1280
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:06,560
know

1281
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,800
i do password analysis based on if

1282
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,319
someone i work for an insurance company

1283
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,240
if someone has a password password that

1284
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,160
contains the word insurance or a variant

1285
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,640
of it or i know how popular that is in

1286
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,560
my company

1287
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,520
um

1288
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,200
so it's quite good you can customize it

1289
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,160
in that way

1290
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,760
and a couple of twitter's worth a follow

1291
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,359
for password cracking tips and tricks so

1292
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,839
like i said when xb5421 chickenman's

1293
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,280
really nice on twitter he'll reach out

1294
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,440
and help you as much as possible stealth

1295
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,040
floyd another nice guy he's got a

1296
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,720
training course dedicated to password

1297
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,599
cracking if any you're interested um

1298
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,680
i think he's in the us so whether he'll

1299
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,040
come over the uk or whether you can do a

1300
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,680
remote i don't know but he's his

1301
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,200
company's actually selling a training

1302
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,000
course on it james cosmi as as opposed

1303
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,119
to i think his name is xpo ip i think

1304
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,480
and you'll find him all over the hashtag

1305
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,800
forums really useful resource

1306
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,920
and simon prime whoops daisy

1307
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,800
cynoprime is the actual group the crap

1308
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,480
me if you can kind of like

1309
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,040
ctf

1310
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,680
so

1311
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,079
i come to the end but

1312
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,599
what time is it now 5 16.

1313
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,200
okay so i'm going to call it there there

1314
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,400
in that case

1315
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,240
but if you do want to find me uh you can

1316
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,960
go to my website or hit me up on twitter

1317
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,040
more than happy to answer any questions

1318
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,400
that come in i'll just double check now

1319
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,520
see what come in uh okay yeah so

1320
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,920
what is star trek

1321
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,079
create a show known to man uh

1322
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,359
okay

1323
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,880
is it true i have a massive word list i

1324
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,200
have many many word lists from many many

1325
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,480
word lists

1326
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,160
anyway

1327
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,079
uh

1328
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,760
what rule set can i add to dive and rock

1329
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,480
you just speed up cracking tommy tom

1330
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,079
tommy's is my arch nemesis uh in my old

1331
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,640
company uh he was one of the ones who

1332
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,560
who was like oh it's too it's too much

1333
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,240
effort but

1334
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,800
yeah great okay thanks for the troll
