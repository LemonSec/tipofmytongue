1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,120
good afternoon everybody um hopefully

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,120
you've all had your ice cream because

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,360
obviously that's very important that we

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,840
all get ice cream and we're all

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,239
duly hydrated

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,359
this session uh is entitled how to

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
enhance your cyber security career

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,960
through regional

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
alliances

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,960
um just by way of show of hands just

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,039
before we get into the presentation

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,119
proper can i just

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,239
find out if you are members of any kind

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,920
of regional uh user groups or clusters

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
or any kind of community where you get

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,480
together on a regular basis to talk

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,640
about cyber security i'm sure of hands

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
okay so a few of you are but others

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
aren't okay so that's good to know okay

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,000
um so we are going to talk about this in

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,920
quite a lot of detail today about the

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
power of alliances and

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,199
i think it's important before we do that

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,399
however is to have a bit of an

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,119
introduction about who i am so that you

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,960
get an understanding of

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,840
my career and my background so that you

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,320
can at least see how i've used alliances

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,600
and

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,040
partnerships throughout my entire career

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,159
to get to do the things that i get to do

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,000
so

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,840
my name's gary hubbard

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,080
i've been in cyber security and

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,759
information security for about 35 years

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,600
i've worked for

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
large organizations the likes of ge

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,799
money i worked for sainsbury's i worked

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,799
for rspca in the past uh and a variety

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,880
of smaller organizations that to be

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,399
honest with you you probably will have

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,240
never heard of

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
so the smallest client the smallest

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
company i ever worked with was

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
an entrepreneur so it was literally a

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
one-man band and helps them implement

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,040
information security

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,119
but over the that 35 years i've worked

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,920
with a variety of different people

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,719
to get to a point where i'm

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,800
asked to go and speak internationally

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,878
about cyber security

53
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,040
organizational resilience business

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,599
continuity risk

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,319
standards etc and of course good old

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,920
cyber security from a technical

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
perspective but that is lesser and

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
lesser and it's more and more now around

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,879
talking about things like fraud and

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,319
cyber crime

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560
and how do we

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
affect change in society

63
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,480
i'm invited to speak on the bbc i've

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
been invited to speak as i said around

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
the world um and i'm also

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,760
being invited to contribute to various

67
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,160
different journals and to various

68
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,080
different books as well

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
um and i've already authored my own

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,879
books as well so the last book that you

71
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
can see here the art of cyber security

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
is a book that i wrote

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
on my own and it's not just purely me

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,480
plugging the book i promise

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
what i'm trying to show you here is that

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,080
the majority of the work that i have

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,840
been published in has been a

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
collaborative approach it's been me

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,239
working with other people

80
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,239
to develop a piece at work that is used

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,319
again internationally it's used in

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,560
academia it's used within law

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
enforcement but it's people working with

84
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
me or me working with them i'm very

85
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,799
lucky and very proud to have that happen

86
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,920
just this last week i was invited to

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,120
speak at amazon headquarters down in

88
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,280
london uh at the

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,040
london policing college or with the

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
london police in college

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
with these group of

92
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,159
individuals who were there to talk about

93
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,280
again

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
national and international

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,680
cyber crime and fraud and talk about

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
mechanisms and methods that we could

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
employ that would actually change the

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
way that law enforcement works in

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,000
relation to cyber crime and fraud

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
it's a collaborative approach it can't

101
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,560
be just one person who understands how

102
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
to do all of these things that's just

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,360
not

104
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,400
ever going to happen this is why

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160
regional alliances and building

106
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,959
alliances is so important

107
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,639
but

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,960
what is an alliance what do we mean by

109
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,040
an alliance well

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
this is the definition so these are the

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,199
definitions so an alliance is a

112
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
relationship based on similarity of

113
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,600
interest nature or qualities the state

114
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
of being joined or associated

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
and that's why i was asking earlier if

116
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,240
you are part of any kind of groups or

117
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,440
are you um you know in any clusters

118
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,199
already where you actually get together

119
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,800
and you discuss

120
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,199
information security cyber security in

121
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,360
its broader sense

122
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,639
now

123
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,840
some of you may have noticed at the

124
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
beginning of this presentation on the

125
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,160
front

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,960
slides in actual fact there was a logo

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,320
sort of hidden

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,120
slightly in the background there um

129
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
if anyone noticed that then well done

130
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,560
there's no prizes but well done

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
i include it because i am a bit of a

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
star wars

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
fan and i think star wars has many

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,479
lessons to teach us when it comes to

135
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,280
uh cyber security and um

136
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
one of those of course is that the whole

137
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,320
franchise would have been a whole lot

138
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,199
different

139
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,000
had the empire just encrypted that

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
usb stick and it would have never been

141
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,199
put into r2d2 and of course where's the

142
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,919
network segregation when r2d2 can just

143
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,759
go and plug himself into any old usb

144
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,680
port and seems to get gain access to

145
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
every single aspect of the death star

146
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600
but enough of that because we're not

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,919
here to talk about star wars um but what

148
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,919
we are here to talk about is what it

149
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,320
does have to teach us which is that star

150
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,360
wars

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,199
teaches us that you've got to have some

152
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,360
clear objectives and in your careers if

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
it's any surprise to you i don't know

154
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
but you have to have clear objectives

155
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,280
about what you are trying to achieve so

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
when you're thinking about joining

157
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,639
joining a cluster or you're joining a

158
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,199
group you've got to ask yourself what am

159
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,840
i going to give to that group and what

160
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,080
will they give to me

161
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
because it's a a two-way exchange it's

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,639
not just about what you can get from

163
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,199
that group

164
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,919
it's about being stronger together

165
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,680
and i'm going to again repeat this

166
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,520
message quite regularly here throughout

167
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,919
this presentation which is

168
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,240
we can't just do this on our own

169
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
there's a multitude of skills in this

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,919
room right now that if i was to look to

171
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,639
protect an organization

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,400
maybe all of you could be involved in

173
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,160
helping some of that but you certainly

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
all come from a different walk of life a

175
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,520
different

176
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
perspective you offer a different

177
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,680
viewpoint you have a different

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,160
upbringing a belief system which again

179
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,720
together helps us

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
better defend

181
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,919
organizations that we are there to

182
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,960
defend

183
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,680
so we're stronger together

184
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
[Music]

185
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,400
but trust takes time

186
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
and what i would say to you again is if

187
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
you are thinking about joining a cluster

188
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520
or if you are already a member of a

189
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,199
cluster that

190
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,520
it's about a relationship it's about

191
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,039
coming together working together and

192
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
when you worked with a small group of

193
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,840
people over time you can contribute and

194
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
you can develop your own skills as well

195
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,440
as theirs

196
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,199
and you can become a part of that

197
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,080
trusted community

198
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,840
so okay why is this important why are

199
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,319
you know why do we need to have groups

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,520
why do we need to have alliances well

201
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,440
let's be perfectly honest the problem

202
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,680
isn't going away and when i talk about

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,360
the problems i'm talking about the kinds

204
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,599
of things i was talking to the london

205
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
police in college just this week

206
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,759
you know the very size of the problem

207
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
that we are facing with are just

208
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,240
increasing all the times the police

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,319
themselves have recognized that actually

210
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,919
the first responders aren't them it's us

211
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
we are the first responders we are the

212
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,680
people who are the best and first and

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
possibly last line of defense the police

214
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,919
aren't coming charging over the hill to

215
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,440
protect us

216
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,280
the threats are only ever increasing the

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,160
globalization of the problems is only

218
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,560
getting worse and again the

219
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
conversations we were having about the

220
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
difficulties that law enforcement has

221
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,039
about tackling fraud and cyber crime

222
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,800
he's very simple

223
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,639
we're talking about a legal system that

224
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,559
is ill-equipped to deal with the

225
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,880
problems that we're faced with today

226
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,080
you know if you just think about the

227
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,240
computer misuse act who's read the

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
computer misuse act

229
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,399
exactly very few people have read the

230
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,399
computer mr sac but i can tell you right

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,480
now it is woefully inadequate for the

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,320
world in which we live

233
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
and the emerging technologies that are

234
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,920
there you know we've got to be thinking

235
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,320
about the uh internet of things

236
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,640
it seemed a complete alien concept when

237
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,880
i was talking about cryptocurrencies and

238
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
the frauds around those and i was

239
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,959
talking about how do we secure nfts

240
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,279
which again seems like alien concepts

241
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
now i only know about nfts and

242
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
cryptocurrencies not because i'm an

243
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,959
expert in that but because i'm part of a

244
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,120
cluster part of a group that has

245
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440
professionals and specialists in those

246
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
areas and i can bring them to me and i

247
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
can say look i've got this problem

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
i need to be able to solve what can we

249
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
do together

250
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
and of course you know this

251
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,680
heightened competition in uh in business

252
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,760
again is only ever increa causing us

253
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,040
problems

254
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,360
can i again show by way of show of hands

255
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,480
and i appreciate people on uh on camera

256
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,920
here uh won't be able to show their

257
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
hands but be thinking about this who

258
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,199
here runs their own business

259
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
who here works for a business

260
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
so you yourselves you will know that in

261
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,320
your organizations that commerce is only

262
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
getting more difficult we're looking for

263
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,240
ways to improve our securities and to be

264
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,120
more competitive having good knowledge

265
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
and skills in this area will absolutely

266
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,040
help

267
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,480
and it's of course this increased

268
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,959
demands from customers

269
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,079
now

270
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
as i've already said there is a

271
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
there's a problem that we face that we

272
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,959
ourselves can be fooled into thinking

273
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,839
well i'm a you know a one-man band i'm a

274
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,440
one person here solo artist i know cyber

275
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
security i'm really skilled in this one

276
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,800
particular aspect of that particular

277
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,680
aspect well unfortunately as the saying

278
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,279
goes no

279
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,320
man is an island you need to work

280
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,360
together

281
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,399
you need to build

282
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,839
those alliances you need to build

283
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,040
partnerships now i'm going to tell you

284
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,800
right here right now i've worked for

285
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,279
small consultancies my own i ran my own

286
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
consultancy for a while sold that to a

287
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,680
larger business and then i put that

288
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
business behind me i've now gone on to

289
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,680
build my own business again

290
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,760
and i promise you that right at the

291
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,800
heart of that business strategy

292
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,320
is alliances building alliances building

293
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,560
partnerships is absolutely at the heart

294
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,399
of what we need to do

295
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,279
because it allows us to put skills share

296
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,360
creativity exchange information combine

297
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,920
resources collaborate and work together

298
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
putting all of those things together

299
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,480
makes any one person far stronger than

300
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
should i try and do all these things on

301
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
my own

302
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
and again as a

303
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
a person who's building my own business

304
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,640

financial experts and that also includes

309
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,279

310
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,360

315
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,800
cyber security and information security

317
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,000

319
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000

321
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,800

338
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,800
you to my linkedin page i'd like you to

339
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880

i will be sharing these slides i will

341
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,639
also be sharing some information about

342
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,160
some of the clusters that we're talking

343
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,279
about here

344
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,760
and also just for fun

345
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,160
i would like you to send your most

346
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,000
interesting photograph from the

347
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
conference

348
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,519
to that connection when you connect with

349
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,680
me and we will choose that name uh one

350
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,079
of those um images and

351
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,399
uh connections at random and you will

352
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,160
win the copy of the uh the book that i

353
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,839
showed you earlier the art of cyber

354
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,839
security

355
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,800
so there's an incentive so you can go

356
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,639
onto linkedin you can start to build up

357
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,399
alliances and you can start to network

358
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,240
through that particular medium as well

359
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,399
now i have worked with some individuals

360
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,800
when i talk to them about networking and

361
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,480
i talk to them about connecting with

362
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,720
other people and about going to groups

363
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,639
i've had some of them say well i like

364
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
working alone

365
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,519
well

366
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,279
unfortunately

367
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,240
you will get picked off you will get you

368
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,399
will fall by the wayside i've seen over

369
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,720
the last 35 plus years

370
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
of working with individuals

371
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,199
who have said that they are lone wolves

372
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,279
and they prefer to work alone

373
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,720
unfortunately

374
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,560
they don't develop they become obsolete

375
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
funnily enough i was talking to

376
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,880
one of my fellow colleagues at uh the

377
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,000
yorkshire cyber security cluster mike um

378
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,560
earlier today talking about how

379
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,839
our knowledge

380
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,760
quickly becomes obsolete

381
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
in this world

382
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
i've been doing what i do for 35 plus

383
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,399
years

384
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
and

385
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
you know in all honesty with the with

386
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,120
you it's if i every five years every 10

387
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,639
years you have to renew you have to

388
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,040
refresh your knowledge how do i learn

389
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
how do we learn we work together we

390
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,639
learn by working together

391
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,720
so let's start now

392
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,079
and again i'm very aware that it's

393
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,079
straight after lunch so we're into this

394
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,959
new zone um i would like to for us to

395
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
start to understand how we can work

396
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,480
together better

397
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,920
so

398
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
let's network

399
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,040
i'm going to ask you and i'm going to

400
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,440
time you you've got five minutes what i

401
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
would like you to do is come out of your

402
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,800
seats

403
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,560
and go and introduce yourself to

404
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
somebody you have not met yet

405
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,519
that's in this room

406
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,519
you've got five minutes

407
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,399
and i am watching you so please do

408
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,040
out of your seats go and say hello to

409
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,880
somebody that you haven't met

410
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,480
and when you go and say hello to someone

411
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,160
you haven't met find out what their

412
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,720
skills are yep please go and say hello

413
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,279
to someone

414
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
for anybody who's watching online then

415
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,000
um you can just obviously go and take a

416
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,560
look on linkedin go and take a look at

417
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,399
uh various groups that you think you

418
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,839
should be a member of

419
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,240
uh go and take a look around the the

420
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,639
linkedin groups but not just

421
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,199
information security but broader than

422
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,320
that so don't just keep to your own lane

423
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,800
within cyber security think about

424
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
the other kinds of areas so governance

425
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
risk and compliance the areas that maybe

426
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,040
you feel uncomfortable with incident

427
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
management business continuity

428
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
is that your area if it's your area then

429
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,040
go and speak to some of the more

430
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
technical aspects

431
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,399
that's a great way to be able to start

432
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,040
networking just online

433
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,519
okay guys so just one more minute and

434
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,800
then we can take our seats again

435
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
and just also for those people watching

436
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,959
online what i like to do what i find

437
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,040
really interesting is to actually step

438
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,680
even outside of our industry go into the

439
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,560
hr groups find out what hr think about

440
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,720
information security what do finance

441
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,959
directors think about cyber security

442
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,800
what are they talking about because if

443
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
you want insights i think being online

444
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,440
going into linkedin groups you're almost

445
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,759
like a ghost you can wander through a

446
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,959
party listening into conversations

447
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,040
and you can find out what their true

448
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,839
concerns are what their worries are

449
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,839
and then that translates into business

450
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,440
so when you're sat with your finance

451
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,360
directors or your hr directors your

452
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
operations directors or your ceos you

453
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,199
can actually talk in the way that they

454
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,040
understand and you can explain that you

455
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,800
understand their problems it's a great

456
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,120
way to build your networks as well

457
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
okay guys can you take your seats again

458
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,040
please

459
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,639
thank you

460
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,480
okay thank you for that

461
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,919
hopefully you've made some new friends

462
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,439
that's awesome

463
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,400
and

464
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,280
that's what it's all about so networking

465
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
um can feel

466
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
can feel awkward sometimes

467
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,039
um

468
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,760
because it feels quite forced

469
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
because you don't quite know what to how

470
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
to start the conversation maybe and you

471
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
know not everybody just loves walking up

472
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,640
to complete strangers it's uh and

473
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,720
starting and get engaged in conversation

474
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
it feels alien it's not something that's

475
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,160
taught that often in schools i don't

476
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,120
believe

477
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,640
so it can feel quite alien to us

478
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,440
um but there is another way

479
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
and this really is the mainstay of this

480
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,039
presentation and this is what i'm trying

481
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
to get you to understand is that there

482
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,799
are mechanisms there are absolutely

483
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,240
linkedin and there's loads of groups

484
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
that you can go and join and you can be

485
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,720
a silent observer you know what is it

486
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,919
they say

487
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,440
lurk more

488
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
you can always look and just sit in the

489
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,880
background just listening in and

490
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
passively taking on this information or

491
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
you can engage

492
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
and that's what we really want you to do

493
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,840
we really want you to do that through a

494
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,200
cluster now there is um a stand

495
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,760
uh outside that you'll have seen which

496
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,400
is the yorkshire cyber security cluster

497
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,440
um

498
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
we have a number of our members here uh

499
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,520

500
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,039
so i would encourage you to go and say

501

collaboration and it's about driving

506
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
regional sector growth through uk cyber

507
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,880
clusters it's mission and i'm not going

508
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,799
to read this to you because you can read

509
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
yourselves

510
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,960
but ultimately its mission is to

511
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
grow

512
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,280
the ecos it is to nurture talent it is

513
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,200
to develop

514
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
a network of professionals and

515
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
professional groups who can come

516
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,760
together who can drive

517
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,240
national and even international

518
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
initiatives

519
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,000
its mission

520
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,840
in short is

521
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,880
uh it exists to uh to drive economic

522
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
growth in the sector

523
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
it's about networking knowledge exchange

524
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,080
sharing of best practice and there's

525
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
some key words in there

526
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
some really key words that you need to

527
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,919
take away you need to absorb these

528
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,480
information because it's important if

529
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,760
you are going to develop as part of one

530
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,440
of the clusters

531
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
it's opportunities for regional and

532
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,760
ultimately national growth

533
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,160
i believe one of the reasons we love

534
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
what we do is because we feel like we're

535
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,320
part of something bigger than ourselves

536
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,840
it's certainly the thing that drives me

537
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
and it's the thing that has driven me

538
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,760
for the last 35 years that i feel like

539
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,440
i'm contributing to a safer world

540
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
now you can only do that in part by

541
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,679
working for one organization or starting

542
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,080
your own business but by being a part of

543
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,320
a larger cluster it allows you to have

544
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,720
that influence

545
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,799
now there's a lot of words on here on

546
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,039
these screens and again i'm not going to

547
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,559
read them all out to you because i think

548
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,480
it's more important that you understand

549
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
you take some of this away with you

550
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,159
which is why i wanted you to connect to

551
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,600
me so i can provide these slides for you

552
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
but as it says here it's about

553
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,039
developing that ecosystem stimulating

554
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
innovation and addressing the cyber

555
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
skills gap

556
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,080
is there a cyber skills gap

557
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,320
it depends on your point of view but

558
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
certainly within most organizations and

559
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,640
certainly within ourselves there are

560
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,559
gaps there are gaps in our knowledge

561
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,280
because we can't know everything

562
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,919
but working together we absolutely can

563
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,480
pull the perfect team together

564
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,000
and when you think even when we think

565
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,919
about hacking and hacking groups and we

566
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,200
think about apts we know that

567
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,679
it's not just one person

568
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,520
carrying out a particular attack it's a

569
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,200
social engineer it's somebody who's good

570
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,679
at coding he's somebody who's good at uh

571
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,520
with apps it's somebody who's good

572
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,600
understands iot devices it's somebody's

573
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,120
good with whatever it might be

574
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,559
but it's a team of people who come

575
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
together to perpetrate those actions

576
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,080
against us and yet we find alien to then

577
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,840
put ourselves into a position where

578
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,240
we're working with collaboratively with

579
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,760
other people

580
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,799
so we need to do that more often

581
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,600
now there are a number of strategic aims

582
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,000
and strategies that

583
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,240
the ukc3 have put in place

584
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,760
first of all

585
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,080
it's about strengthening the uk's cyber

586
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,559
system as our ecosystem as i've already

587
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,600
mentioned the second is building a

588
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,640
resilient and prosperous digital uk who

589
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,880
doesn't want that that's what we would

590
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
all want to be a part of

591
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,120
it's also about taking the lead in the

592
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,520
technologies vital to cyber power

593
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,840
i've spoken to a number of you

594
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,159
out there and some of the technologies

595
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,720
that are being used and some of the

596
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,919
developments

597
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
in place i think is

598
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,320
significant it's magnificent

599
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
and certainly i wish that this

600
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,919
conference would have happened last week

601
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,840
so that when i went to spoke at the

602
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,919
events for the london policing college i

603
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,000
could have taken some of your insights

604
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,159
to that event because i learned so much

605
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
already today

606
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,240
it's also about advancing uk global

607
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,080
leadership and influence secure and

608
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,280
prosperous

609
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,158
international order

610
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,600
it's not just about the uk

611
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,880
because we know that we talked about

612
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,720
that earlier it's a globalization it's a

613
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
global problem that we're facing

614
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
so these strategies that we're looking

615
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,520
to employ of course you know extremely

616
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,760
important importance we have a number of

617
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,240
objectives or strategic objectives and

618
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,080
they are simply these

619
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,000
and that is that we need cluster

620
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,760
developments we need

621
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,799
cluster collaboration that's what kc3 is

622
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,360
all about because even a recognition

623
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,919
that there are clusters but they can't

624
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,760
work in isolation they need to work

625
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,039
together

626
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,960
it's all about promoting clusters which

627
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
we're doing today and again about

628
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,120
growing the network which hopefully

629
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,720
following this presentation you will all

630
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,320
rush out and look for your own cluster

631
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
to become a member of

632
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,120
and it's about representation

633
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,559
how we're going to do that well of

634
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,480
course there has to be a framework

635
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
there's a enablers the way that we do

636
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,200
this is really important as well but the

637
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,960
structure is there

638
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,279
it's there for you to actually

639
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,640
participate in to be a part of and to

640
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,360
contribute to

641
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,600
we need you to be a part of that system

642
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,200
because without you

643
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
the ecosystem

644
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
fails

645
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,360
just like again the rebel alliance it

646
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,440
needed many people to be able to come

647
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,840
together to be able to be successful

648
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,600
wasn't just down to one person

649
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
talking about this individually again

650
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
what i would just like to just point you

651
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,559
to is this idea about growing cyber

652
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,000
skills

653
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,799
so the uk cluster itself

654
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,760
um the ukc3

655
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
it's about

656
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,960
not just you coming along and we absorb

657
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
all your knowledge and take you and you

658
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,720
know leave you as a you know as a husk

659
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
on the ground it's about developing your

660
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,240
skills

661
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,400
who here i mean i asked the question

662
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,640
earlier who here read the computer miss

663
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
you sites very few hands went so

664
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,320
how many in this room have read the gdpr

665
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,520
the

666
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,440
general data protection regulation who's

667
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,640
read it

668
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,480
excellent who would consider themselves

669
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,120
an expert in it

670
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,559
okay

671
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,080
and i would only leave my hand up

672
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,760
because of the fact i've been a dpo for

673
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,080
20 years

674
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,919
but by being part of the cluster you can

675
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,400
learn and you can understand about how

676
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,080
cyber security and information security

677
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,520
assists with things like gdpr

678
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,200
what are your skills gaps because you've

679
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,840
got them i've got them we've all got

680
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,120
them of course this

681
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,360
collaboration as i've already mentioned

682
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,240
it's about developing this uh ecosystem

683
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
it's about working together

684
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
and it's about also directing funds in

685
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,919
the right place

686
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
this is a government-backed scheme

687
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,559
so it's not like we just get you to

688
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,080
volunteer for these things of course

689
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,159
that is pretty much what we are asking

690
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,799
but when it comes to events when it

691
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,000
comes to um and major initiatives there

692
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,120
is funding that is available from

693
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,720
national government to be able to assist

694
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,919
to push

695
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,720
this agenda

696
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
of course this promotion of course is

697
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,799
about capturing good news stories we

698
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,760
want to develop ourselves but we also

699
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,120
want to make sure that we're working

700
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,360
with individuals and we're working with

701
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,159
organizations to promote the good work

702
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,080
that cyber security professionals are

703
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,480
doing

704
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,799
and it's about growing the network now

705
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,200
in terms of the network itself um i

706
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,360
asked earlier who's a part of

707
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,039
any particular group or any clusters um

708
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,279
so again there are clusters up and down

709
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,640
the country

710
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,760
that ukc3 have put in place so depending

711
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,159
upon where you've traveled from

712
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,520
there may be a cluster that's quite

713
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,679
close to you and i would urge you to go

714
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,679
and seek out those clusters they'll be

715
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,600
on linkedin they will have their own

716
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
websites

717
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,080
but can i ask again by way of show of

718
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,880
hands who here is in the yorkshire

719
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
region

720
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,480
so quite a few of you

721
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,159
okay

722
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,080
you need to be seeking out

723
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,919
the yorkshire cyber security cluster if

724
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
you're not already a member and become a

725
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,159
part of that community so you can again

726
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,279
contribute and you can help us represent

727
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,720
who we are we can represent um

728
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
the stakeholders engagements

729
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,360
building stronger relationships tech uk

730
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,279
dcms and dit etc

731
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,960
we have greater representation if we

732
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,720
work together

733
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,159
and i've already mentioned it there's

734
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,320
money to be

735
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,880
to be given to us to clusters to for

736
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,559
organizations to be able to develop

737
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,960
cyber security

738
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,720
you can get a part of be involved in

739
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,200
these conversations just like i was with

740
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,880
the london policing college that came

741
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
about through collaboration and

742
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,320
conversations and networks that opened

743
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,760
up to me

744
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
through working with the cluster and

745
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,679
then the people i met at the cluster

746
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,520
and then they identified some of the

747
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,600
skills that i have that perhaps were

748
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,520
needed in that particular area or just

749
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,399
the fact that and i fully admit this

750
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,480
that i was there purely to represent

751
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,880
what i term as the common man we had

752
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
some major large organizations in that

753
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
room talking about some major

754
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,640
initiatives but they seem to have

755
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,840
forgotten

756
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,919
the sme they forgot about the small

757
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,240
organization they forgot about

758
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,559
you know the uh the entrepreneur who's

759
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,240
just set up a business and hasn't got a

760
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,200
clue about cyber security

761
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,440
and they are represented within

762
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,840
the clusters that we put together

763
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,520
they represent all of these areas

764
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,600
because they know that it's important it

765
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,399
showcases our capability

766
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,640
we build uh partnerships with academia

767
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,399
as i've already said

768
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,760
some of the initiatives that we're

769
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,679
working on within the yorkshire cyber

770
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,039
security uh cluster is to uh work with

771
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,600
local businesses to again develop their

772
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,440
cybersecurity skills

773
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
to teach

774
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,200
children about cyber security and

775
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,559
hopefully

776
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,799
engage with them so that they believe in

777
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,200
a career a career in cyber is something

778
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,240
that is worth exploring

779
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,919
and lord already knows that we need more

780
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,399
women in cyber so going into schools and

781
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,760
and uh you know really inspiring the the

782
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,720
next generation of female hackers and

783
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,200
social engineers would be amazing to be

784
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,399
a part of that i think is absolutely

785
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,799
vital because we again need that

786
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,840
diversity in thoughts and

787
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,799
in

788
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,120
action

789
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,559
so

790
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,640
it's essentially a platform for

791
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,919
innovation

792
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,559
collaboration and knowledge

793
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,679
exchange

794
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,120
so

795
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
it's a call to arms

796
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
you need to join your local

797
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,919
um

798
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,360
cluster

799
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,720
so again if you want to take your phones

800
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
out and take a picture of this feel free

801
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,679
but hopefully you've connected to me and

802
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,679
i will send you these slides anyway

803
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,960
and i'm looking forward to seeing the

804
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,840
most

805
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,159
interesting photograph keep them clean

806
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,080
please

807
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
um that you have and again we'll pick

808
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,559
your name at random um

809
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,200
as part of that but join your local

810
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,440
cluster you know within yorkshire i've

811
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,039
already mentioned it several times here

812
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,120
i'm very proud to be part of the the

813
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,919
cluster itself uh within yorkshire

814
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,039
our

815
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,480
um

816
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,720
reason i raised on detroit is exactly

817
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,080
the same as that within the uc3 which is

818
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,240
to have regional resilience or to build

819
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,120
regional resilience it's also to

820
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,360
uh for innovation and growth

821
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,960
and we're always looking for ideas we're

822
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,399
always looking for participants to

823
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,559
people to come along to the cluster

824
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,520
itself

825
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,919
and to be able to assist

826
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,919
and that nurturing of cyber talents

827
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,279
we're always looking for people who can

828
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,960
come along who might have a different

829
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,600
viewpoint a different idea

830
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,159
um and if there's ways that we can help

831
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,480
you to develop in your area if you have

832
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,399
a question if you have a problem then as

833
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,480
a team we might be able to assist and

834
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,880
support

835
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,000
now

836
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,440
what does it do what does the clusters

837
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,200
do typically well ours most specifically

838
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,840
we have weekly support of the

839
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,880
modules for cyber epq we have

840
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
monthly webinars

841
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,200
and we have a website with blogs so if

842
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,039
you are a budding writer or if you're

843
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,799
interested and you want to feel you want

844
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,320
to contribute

845
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,240
then you can write blogs and we will

846
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,399
happily take those blogs and feature

847
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,519
them on our website you can join

848
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,080
the cluster come along to a meeting meet

849
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,760
different people we will discuss

850
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,240
different topics as i've said it's not

851
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,039
just about talking about one particular

852
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,080
aspect for anyone of you

853
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,399
here who is a member of as i've said any

854
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,120
kind of group that's here that talks

855
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,440
purely about web apps or you're here

856
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,039
just purely because you're developers or

857
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,480
you're here purely because you do pen

858
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,640
testing or you're here purely because of

859
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,880
the fact that you do iot that's great

860
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,159
and you should be part of those

861
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,480
ecosystems

862
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
but you're only going to

863
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,720
reaffirm what you already know

864
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,399
you might learn some new tips and tricks

865
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,840
and ideas

866
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,760
but with a cluster and the cluster like

867
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,159
the cluster the yorkshire cluster you're

868
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,000
going to learn something brand new

869
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,679
because we're going to be talking about

870
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,000
data protection we'll be talking about

871
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
data ethics we'll be talking about

872
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,720
privacy we'll be talking about online

873
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,960
safeties bill we'll be talking about

874
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,679
some of the technical aspects so this

875
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,080
very week we were talking about web and

876
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,480
email defenses and we had some great

877
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,640
speakers coming in experts to talk about

878
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,360
those particular aspects i'll certainly

879
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,200
learn something new on every single

880
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,360
session that we hold because we don't

881
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
talk about the same kind of things every

882
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,279
single time

883
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,159
cyber security is far more than just the

884
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,000
nuts and bolts and the flashing lights

885
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
we know that we'll have experts talking

886
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,360
about social engineering for instance

887
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,799
and in terms of the actual cluster

888
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,279
itself well here are

889
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,519
our steering group

890
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,960
some of our steering group are in this

891
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,240
room right now and um i am going to ask

892
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,000
because we've got about 10 minutes so i

893
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,320
am going to ask uh at the end because we

894
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,880
are coming very quickly to the end

895
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
a couple of the uh

896
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,600
custom members to come down here just to

897
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,640
talk about what they've got out of being

898
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,840
members of the the cluster

899
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
itself what i am going to say in terms

900
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,640
of

901
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,720
finishing my part of the talk what i

902
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,559
would say to you is that

903
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,880
in conclusion

904
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,640
there are all of these different kinds

905
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,679
of groups that you could be a part of

906
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,960
and

907
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,120
in essence you know we are stronger

908
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,440
together if we work together

909
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,399
and the final um

910
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,799
message i will give to you before i ask

911
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,480
a couple of the cluster members to come

912
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,279
down

913
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,120
is um actually i read a book or i read i

914
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,240
read a book

915
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,760
and every day it has a different quote a

916
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,399
different thing and on the july the 21st

917
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,760
the day before

918
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,440
i put the uh some of these slides

919
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,120
together um

920
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,360
this was the inscription that i read

921
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,279
made for working together

922
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,799
whenever you have trouble getting up in

923
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,240
the morning remind yourself that you've

924
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
been made by nature for the purpose of

925
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
working with others whereas even

926
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,159
unthinking animals share sleeping and

927
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,480
it's our own natural purpose that is

928
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,359
more fitting and more satisfying

929
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,719
marcus aurelius and what i would say is

930
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,879
if it's good enough for marcus aurelius

931
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,679
then it's good enough for us

932
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,280
we need to work together so with that

933
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
could i just ask a couple of the cluster

934
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,520
members just to come down and assist

935
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,000
with the last five ten minutes of the

936
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,320
presentation um

937
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,280
shaz would you like to come down

938
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,679
nice

939
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,598
thank you

940
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,839
so it's the same question to you both

941
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,440
just

942
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
a few minutes

943
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,719
ladies first

944
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,440
so

945
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,280
what would you say you've got

946
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
most out of being a member of the

947
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,240
cluster right okay um can you hear me

948
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,839
yeah okay

949
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,000
um course leader for cybersecurity

950
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,920
forensics and

951
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
um the first time when i heard about by

952
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,640
csc was when um

953
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,880
it was a security event and i noticed

954
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,160
that it was to do with our region and i

955
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,119
thought oh this is a great idea to join

956
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,520
find out what the demands are in

957
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,320
industry in order to help and improve

958
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,760
our courses

959
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,839
and be able to improve the students

960
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,640
skills as and after graduation they

961
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,960
could find jobs so just improving um the

962
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,800
courses that we offering to site

963
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,560
to the student

964
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,200
here so that was the first idea i

965
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,920
started i had i didn't know

966
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,800
how

967
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,839
how much benefit i got out of this so

968
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,040
basically i've got a group of so

969
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,079
lovely people i work with i learn every

970
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,400
day something new and this is something

971
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,760
that i really love and then we help each

972
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,320
other we help people and it's just so

973
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,640
fulfilling and satisfying

974
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,320
perfect thank you

975
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,200
excellent thanks all right

976
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,800
introduce yourself and then

977
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,599
yeah so uh my name is alex martin um

978
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,520
business development manager basically

979
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
in sales for cyber security

980
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,680
uh reason why i joined the cyber

981
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,079
security cluster was uh more for the

982
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,760
networking side of things

983
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,960
um i think um there's a few phrases out

984
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
there but uh the man who says he knows

985
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
everything probably knows nothing

986
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,640
and also

987
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,839
if you can't explain

988
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,160
um an industry or a topic

989
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,839
succinctly and quite quickly favorably

990
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,359
to understand you don't understand it

991
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,960
enough yourself

992
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,359
so i joined the cluster to to network

993
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,320
with

994
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,800
people from within cyber security again

995
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,960
to share our stories um there's some

996
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,720
funny stories out there as well anybody

997
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,000
wants to connect to me we'll have a chat

998
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,440
and have a good laugh at some of those

999
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,200
guys as well um but it was again

1000
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,520
knowledge is power and getting the

1001
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,640
stories that are out there

1002
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,480
from other people's experiences in the

1003
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
industry so that you can then take that

1004
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,480
information and translate it to

1005
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,079
other people in your network that you're

1006
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,160
talking to i think that is that is key

1007
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,440
just keeping that the flow of

1008
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,599
information going from from one group to

1009
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,880
another from one person to another

1010
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,079
making sure that everybody kind of

1011
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,920
understands what's going on in the

1012
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,079
industry how it's affecting everybody

1013
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,520
and honestly how we can all work

1014
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
together and collaborate to

1015
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,240
make it a more safer place really

1016
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,640
perfect thank you

1017
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
okay so

1018
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,760
uh with that thank you ever so much chad

1019
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,000
thanks thanks um

1020
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,680
i would just like to thank you for your

1021
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,040
attention um if there are any questions

1022
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,200
feel free if you do have any questions

1023
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,640
please let me know

1024
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,160
are there any questions

1025
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,118
one at the back yes

1026
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,119
okay so uh for benefit of those people

1027
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,560
on on camera who might not have heard

1028
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,680
that

1029
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,760
we're all extremely busy so your point

1030
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,160
was that we're all extremely busy how do

1031
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,359
you find time for something like this

1032
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,800
i would say how do you not find time

1033
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,640
because

1034
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,560
you can um i mean certainly in terms of

1035
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,240
efficiencies working

1036
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
being more efficient you know some of

1037
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,920
the things that we do talk about

1038
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
on our clusters and some of the people

1039
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,880
that

1040
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,760
are in there will talk about different

1041
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,920
ways of working which will improve you

1042
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,960
so you will

1043
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,880
you may find that what you're doing

1044
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,480
actually is you're working quite

1045
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,160
inefficiently and some of the tools that

1046
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,880
you're using are could be improved you

1047
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,040
could have a better process for doing

1048
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,560
some of the engineering that you're

1049
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
involved in

1050
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,040
so

1051
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,920
by

1052
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
almost taking a step back

1053
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,440
and looking at the problem in its

1054
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,079
entirety it will help you to move

1055
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,640
forward faster so it's slowing down to

1056
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,800
move faster and i think there's a

1057
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,760
there's an old analogy um and i don't

1058
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,800
know who said it but it was about um

1059
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,960
sharpening your axe

1060
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,200
and it was the i won't give you the full

1061
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,240
story but effectively um someone once

1062
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,960
once asked if you were to cut down a

1063
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,599
tree if it was going to take you

1064
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,800
10 hours to cut down a tree

1065
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,960
cut up that time how would you go about

1066
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,280
cutting down that tree and they said i

1067
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,320
would sharpen my axe for nine hours

1068
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,280
and then i would go to work on the tree

1069
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,680
or you could do it the other way

1070
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,480
and you can just go straight at the tree

1071
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,920
doing the same thing with a blunt

1072
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,160
instrument and for the next 10 hours go

1073
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,240
at it hard slog

1074
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,480
working wholly and efficiently

1075
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,240
but you will still you will still feel

1076
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,079
the tree

1077
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,760
which way would you prefer to work

1078
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,119
so i don't know if that answers the

1079
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,200
question but i think for me it's about

1080
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,800
taking that step back and then working

1081
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,280
more efficiently

1082
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,720
thank you

1083
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,359
any other questions

1084
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,640
yes sir

1085
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,799
all right

1086
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,200
[Music]

1087
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,480
um so the question being uh is there a

1088
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,599
charter ship to standardize

1089
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,400
um the industry i don't not so much of

1090
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,560
the industry i think certainly at the

1091
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,240
ukc3 there is a an intention to

1092
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,000
have all clusters operating in a very

1093
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,760
similar way so they all have a very

1094
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,599
similar structure i think that would

1095
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,520
ultimately be the desire

1096
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,480
um but every cluster is

1097
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,560
relatively autonomous and can operate it

1098
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,960
however it wishes to operate

1099
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,720
but fundamentally i think that is the

1100
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,800
desire because of all the strategic aims

1101
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,200
that that were mentioned earlier there's

1102
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,520
no desire i don't believe for them to

1103
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,079
create a a standard that all

1104
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,920
organizations would follow like you know

1105
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,119
iso 27001 or you know various other

1106
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,520
different standards um but certainly the

1107
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,280
idea is that all

1108
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,359
the the hope is that all clusters will

1109
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,400
operate in a similar way

1110
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,240
thank you

1111
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,118
any other questions

1112
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,160
no okay thank you ever so much for your

1113
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,440
time i hope that's been of use and again

1114
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,040
the yorkshire cyber security cluster

1115
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,000
table is just outside please go and

1116
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,440
have a look

1117
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
and and sign up and hopefully we'll see

1118
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,119
you at the next event thank you very

1119
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,119
much
