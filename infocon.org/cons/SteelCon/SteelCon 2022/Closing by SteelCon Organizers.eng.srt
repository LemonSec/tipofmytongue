going to come out in batches so we're

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
expecting sort of fairly big queues

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
because the way they're doing it the

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,080
queue is big just sit down wait let the

117
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,680
queue go down let the next match come

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,560
out

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,159

120
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,000
food we had left over from lunch there

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
is more food coming out for dinner than

122
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,519
there was lunch so we should not be

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,918
short of food this time

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,358
um

125
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,759
the doors to the outside world at some

126
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,840
point i don't know what time it is but

127
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,440
at some point they get locked from the

128
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,840
outside so you can go out

129
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,199
but to get back in again you have to

130
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,280
bust security and ask nicely to come

131
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
back in so if you go out for a cigarette

132
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
or anything like that or just get fresh

133
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
air

134
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
just be mindful that

135
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,639
whether you can get back in or maybe

136
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,639
leave somebody inside or whatever

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,639
fault it's university internet

382
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,720
connectivity problems i think possibly

383
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,839
all of us have had problems with the

384
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,680

bring all their stuff along to show or

406

00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
think they've been with us since the

417
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,959
first years we did the kids track

418
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,519
and without getting the kids involved

419
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,480
early

420
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
we should we can lose them so get them

421
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,679
in now get them interested even if they

422
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,640
don't go into security or computing jobs

423
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,119
it gives them a mindset of hacking and

424
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,880
playing with stuff that's valuable for

425
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
