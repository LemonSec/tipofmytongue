1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,000
right welcome to the last talk of still

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,040
con

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,400
and

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,840
just a general thing if you want to fall

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,519
asleep please do just don't snore okay

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,640
if i start snoring please tell me

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,720
right so oh keep us here um

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,320
my general talk today is about

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,480
vulnerabilities that aren't so

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,400
uh i'm not saying what we got from here

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
there's a i could see a few pen testers

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,199
we got anybody from the other side

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
yep so you get you the people who get

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,480
the reports go

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,280
why are they reporting on this rubbish

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,800
which is generally what i've found and

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,879
i've had many years of writing the same

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,200
old crap into reports just checking

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
there's no children no that's okay um

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,160
so it's just a general talk about these

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,960
so

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,239
this is me

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
that is a burning furby it's been my

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,120
avatar for about 12 years

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,480
on various different social medias um hi

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
i'm dave hey

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,720
um i'm also the grumpy person who

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,320
is pretty much the embodiment of the

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,680
actually meme

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,119
um

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,720
you know somebody post something open

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,640
about like how they have to drink eight

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,479
bottles of water a day or you'll

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,799
dehydrate massively and then one goes

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,280
well i think you'll find

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,880
somewhere so i've had to actually mute

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,560
my in-laws because i had to stop myself

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,680
doing it so um

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,119
this is where a lot of this comes from

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,880
is i sit there and i look at the look at

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,040
the sort of myths and i go

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,560
that's bollocks

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,240
so

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,759
um where am i going yeah so

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,040
sort of to explain um i don't

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
back in the naughties i moved from unix

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,000
admin to a to a security guy and then i

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,720
don't know anybody remembers 2000 in the

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,439
security field you had saints and satan

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,399
you had map that was it then a product

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,560
called nessus came along

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
which every started using for everything

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
eventually went commercial because they

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,880
did

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
um

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,720
skipping back to my notes now um

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,878
but in those days you had mailing lists

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
you didn't have massive collections of

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,360
tvs you had no exploit db most of stuff

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
you had to write yourself or use nessus

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,040
so i've written a few scripts

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,720
this one is revealing how old i am

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
um and unfortunately this is one of

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
those ones that's responsible for one of

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
the things that we often get anybody

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
seen ntp mode 6

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
because that's basically that finding

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
and i i saw that in a report two days

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
ago that i q aid

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
and had to then say take it out it's

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,640
absolute bobbins

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,958
um

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
so it it's

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,319
i just find it irritating that we report

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,040
stuff that has no real risk that there's

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
no way of exploiting it there's no way

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,400
of manipulation of it

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
and

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
we waste time trying to evidence it we

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
waste time trying to write about it

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
you guys waste time reviewing it

82
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,480
reviewing the risk on it and eventually

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,080
fixing the damn thing

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,280
and it serves very little purpose

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
um

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,239
so

87
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,000
i'm just going to go through a few

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
sample error messages i want it's a bit

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,120
of audience participation i want you to

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,959
see whether you can guess what nessus

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,440
said by default scores these

92
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,680
so tomcat 404 error messages so if you

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,159
go a default 404 error message you go to

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,200
tomcat there's a page there it says page

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,360
not it found what does nestus call that

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
at anybody for starters

97
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
well number a cvss number six any any

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,560
advancement six

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
oh you're a cynic after my own heart

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
it's actually um it's actually five

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,439
which is a bit overkill because five is

102
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,120
a medium risk a medium risk generally

103
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,319
says

104
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,319
you can exploit this you can pull

105
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,319
information from it you can try and

106
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,840
break things with it

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,319
that seems rather excessive

108
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,720
unencrypted telnet

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
so the literal logic is it looks at port

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,200
23 and sees where it has start tls

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,560
any idea of the cvss

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,680
not quite that bad

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,080
seven any any ransom seven other than

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,080
9.8

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,880
nope it's 5.8

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,639
which as you can see compared to the

117
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
previous one is a bit strange actually

118
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,479
that's the score one score i agree with

119
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
it's about anyway bearing in mind that

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,080
to exploit that you have to be on the

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
same network segment you have to have an

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,360
administrative position or be on a

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
wireless segment to actually sniff that

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,800
data

125
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
or the cam table gets full in the router

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
something weird like that has to happen

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,199
that is quite difficult to exploit in

128
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
the real world

129
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
ssl version 2 enabled

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
burn in mind there are people here who

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,919
are younger than ssl v2

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,720
it came in 1996 so anybody who was born

133
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,680
after that he's younger than sslv2 i'm

134
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,960
just looking to see whether it's anybody

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,239
that old young

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,759
are you young chloe

137
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
so

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
any ideas of what that is so

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
all data will be encrypted there's a

140
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,680
vulnerability of a pattern oracle and my

141
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
sentence tells off in the end because i

142
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
didn't finish writing that sentence um

143
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
any idea where that goes

144
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
i mean technically an encrypted telnet

145
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,120
is five point

146
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,440
is five point eight so it should be less

147
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,560
than that in theory shouldn't it

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
but it's necessary

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
that's the high risk that literally

150
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,880
means drop everything and fix

151
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,639
which comparatively you have to be in

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,319
the same place but you're getting

153
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,560
encrypted data so

154
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
it's actually compared to that one that

155
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,720
one should be higher

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,000
final one is ssl anonymous ciphers

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
so anonymous ciphers are basically

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
unencrypted data you can select a cypher

159
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,639
it's not encrypted

160
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
it's not necessarily third it's in the

161
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,000
list it's one of those ones that can be

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
chosen you can exploit it by

163
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,800
um

164
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,280
uh um setting up initiation or in

165
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,479
advance or doing man-in-the-middle

166
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,240
attacks how much do you guess that is

167
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,639
seven that that would be sensible

168
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,319
so in just in the order that they're

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,639
doing levels of risk

170
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,680
it's like

171
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,240
it's random i i honestly i cannot fault

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
i cannot

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,759
work out the logic on this

174
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,680
so i've attempted to make my own way of

175
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,120
doing a cvs test score for tls findings

176
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,919
there's a python script

177
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,360
i'm planning to put this in place and

178
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
this is what i should be using in future

179
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
reports

180
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,639
because it's better logic than than

181
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,880
nessus has i'm not actually

182
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,319
just picking on lessons here there are

183
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,319
other tools that are just as bad

184
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,800
metasploit um

185
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
and there are nessus does save a lot of

186
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
work so there and as long as you

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,039
actually quantify what it is but this is

188
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,199
a problem these scores are random and

189
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,800
half of those things i clicked there's

190
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,240
no real world exploit well telnet maybe

191
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,560
um

192
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,520
let's go into

193
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
a few examples of things that are

194
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,479
that i've seen reported on since the

195
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,720
year 2000

196
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
and don't let's start with cross-site

197
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,479
tracing

198
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,240
so does anybody know what cross-site

199
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
tracing is

200
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,639
i'm hoping the pen testers do

201
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,199
but cross-site tracing

202
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,440
is you have a trace variable which is

203
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,039
used for debugging

204
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,960
and it responds with the headers

205
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
directly as it is

206
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
so that's it in one command

207
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,479
not really that exciting

208
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,878
um

209
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,680
oh sorry uh so it can be used to do sort

210
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,599
of like cross-site attacks cvs csrf

211
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,240
or cause type attacks

212
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,479
um it's basically a sort of grandfather

213
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,319
of those um

214
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,319
and and generally it will abuse anything

215
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,640
on the user agent to try and pass data

216
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
back and forth i'm just annoying him

217
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,839
because he has to keep on moving the

218
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,719
camera to catch me

219
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,320
um so there is actually reference

220
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,000
there's a sort of passive aggressive

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
comment in the apache manual about it

222
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
which basically goes this is not a

223
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
security vulnerability and

224
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,399
because apache is the only web server

225
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,760
out there that actually supports trace

226
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,920
nowadays

227
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,880
so i thought i'd try trace so try and

228
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
actually do a trace request using all

229
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
the cross-site ones in a browser here's

230
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
it in chrome

231
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,120
fails

232
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160
let's go try edge edges chromium

233
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,240
fails the same error message so chromium

234
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
doesn't support it what about firefox

235
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
i'm getting really desperate now

236
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,640
internet explorer

237
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,720
nothing last

238
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
exploit that you could do was in the

239
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,959
activex

240
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,200
http request module which was last

241
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,920
supported in ie7

242
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,640
which was out of support in 2010 i think

243
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,560
um

244
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,440
as in even if you could exploit it

245
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,399
there's nothing really there

246
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,680
so

247
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,959
modern day

248
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,720
is if we can't find an exploit let's

249
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
have a look at the possible cves

250
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,440
there are 11 cves how many are say

251
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,200
traces enabled on a server

252
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
10 of them

253
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,519
there is one real exploit only which is

254
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,680
a buffer overflow in java system web

255
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,079
server from 2010

256
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,240
and java system web server no longer

257
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,399
exists

258
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,880
this is a total rubbish finding it it

259
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
serves no purpose

260
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,399
it's really hard to exploit

261
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,720
there is one possibility

262
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,240
if there's a very specific build which

263
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
you have a waff or

264
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,079
any sort of caching web service in front

265
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,079
of you could potentially use it to try

266
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,640
and smuggle a header through i've never

267
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,079
seen a situation where i can do this

268
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,440
um

269
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,279
so

270
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
let's dip onto the next one etag

271
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,240
um

272
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,839
i'm starting to see people snore now

273
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,480
uh

274
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,360
so an etag header is um it's a header

275
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,279
designed for caching

276
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
so if you make a request for some of

277
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
that static content it returns an e-tag

278
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
header is that it which is composed of

279
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,200
an inode a sizer file and uh a timestamp

280
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
so the timestamp changes the size of

281
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,720
file changes the server knows to

282
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,320
actually the the client knows to

283
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,160
re-request update that resource and not

284
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,720
bother caching it it's just a method of

285
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,040
saving it the one vulnerability in it is

286
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,360
it says the inode

287
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,079
the inode itself can potentially be used

288
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,839
in a few things

289
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,600
there is only one thing i've ever found

290
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,519
that it can do and that's nfs

291
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
which is network file sharing on unix

292
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,440
um i'm actually responsible for the tag

293
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,160
problem because i put a plugin in niko

294
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,120
about 2008 to actually look for it

295
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,200
and everybody else copied it

296
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,480
so uh that is how an nfs

297
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,040
so i'll go back to nfs nfs has something

298
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,399
called a file handle which is how it

299
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,320
uniquely identifies a file that can be

300
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,720
found or or a directory

301
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
the file handle includes the inode you

302
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,560
can see in there this is sort of the

303
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
linux file handle

304
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
um so there's where it has your eye node

305
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
so it needs to find the inode there and

306
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,440
as you can see there's not really much

307
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
entropy there

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
if i can potentially guess uinode i can

309
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,800
potentially get

310
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
everything in that i could potentially

311
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,320
get an fs file handle

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,800
problem is i need a web server i need an

313
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,959
nfs server that needs to be on the same

314
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,959
thing

315
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,720
um so i need

316
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
all this to be to be true to actually do

317
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,959
that i need the tag to give out valid

318
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,120
eye nodes i need nfs to be the save

319
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
server to be enabled

320
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,240
they all need to be on the same volume

321
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,920
they all need to be exported and the

322
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,800
version s needs to be really ancient

323
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
um

324
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,920
again i've never seen this in 20 years

325
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,360
of pen testing

326
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
um

327
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,600
oops

328
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,880
i'm just going to walk back and check my

329
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,480
notes again

330
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,360
so

331
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,279
it's it it's another thing that can't be

332
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
exported checking cves

333
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
and any guess how many e's exist for

334
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
this

335
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,160
any number

336
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,720
two

337
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,240
hole two

338
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,639
first one is a program in server mass

339
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
from 2003 server master no longer exists

340
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,760
and it does not hide etag and then

341
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,360
there's the original one to say what it

342
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,839
is

343
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,880
all right again i saw this in a recent

344
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,639
report

345
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
why are we reporting this

346
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,560
it doesn't really serve a purpose

347
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,399
um

348
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,040
going on to unquoted spaces

349
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,240
which is something that you always see

350
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
in build queues

351
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
um so windows is a bit weird in how it

352
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
deals with it it's designed to be

353
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,839
um

354
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,600
accepting of change

355
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
so if you have space it doesn't do a

356
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,639
centralized passing like like bash does

357
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,000
it pass it passes everything

358
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,079
individually so you have

359
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,079
space in there can be a bit whipped as

360
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,360
you can sort of see the logic if you

361
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
have no quotes it just creates files

362
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,079
and if one quote it will

363
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,600
sort of treat it as if it's got quotes

364
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
or not

365
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,959
uh which is fine except for if you want

366
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,040
to try and call a program with different

367
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,480
amounts of quotes

368
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,519
so if if i type that command in

369
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,240
windows will try the following order

370
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
and it will try calling jim

371
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
dot xz with parameters of all those

372
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,880
so you can it will try those in order

373
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
so have the preference the ones without

374
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,199
the spaces

375
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,279
um

376
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,560
i'm just realizing how quickly i'm

377
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,399
racing through my slides um

378
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
so

379
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,959
if we go on to this one so if we see

380
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
this in the service definition a service

381
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,360
name a run or a run once and we see

382
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,279
program files bob

383
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,560
first thing it's going to try and do is

384
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,120
run program.exe

385
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,959
so in theory if we can replace

386
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,720
program.exe and create a file called

387
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,519
that

388
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
we can run any code we want

389
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,680
anybody see the floor with that one

390
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,839
the floor is we need to access c colon

391
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,519
backslash

392
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,639
which

393
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,600
we need to be administrators to do

394
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,639
so

395
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,320
it's again

396
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,959
it's a bit

397
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
difficult i have seen real world where

398
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,600
this will happen on d drives or e drives

399
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,959
or s drives but it's something where you

400
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,199
have to check

401
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,040
cves is a bit complicated we have

402
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,279
lots of cvs going back this first came

403
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,680
out in the year 2000 nt bug track where

404
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
it's first listed

405
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,120
um and it's covered by a whole cwe

406
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,120
um very few most of these cvs are

407
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
actually just for a missing quote in in

408
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,199
program files and they can't actually be

409
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,320
exploited because they're all on c drive

410
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,759
um tls vulnerabilities

411
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,560
so we have multiple again most of our

412
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,600
reports on webs are tls

413
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,199
and we have multiple vulnerabilities on

414
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,120
those

415
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
um there's some of the big ones actually

416
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
i've got heart bleeding heartbeat is one

417
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
that should potentially be worried about

418
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
but i haven't seen a heartbleed

419
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,079
exploitable for five years

420
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,199
um

421
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,199
most of these are vulnerabilities on ssl

422
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,279
v3 which you very rarely see

423
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,320
um

424
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,600
the only one i'm going to concentrate on

425
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,639
is the last one which is sweet 32.

426
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,759
so sweet 32

427
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,120
is where you can sniff track the traffic

428
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,320
um and if you use 64-bit block ciphers

429
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,199
you can

430
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,480
potentially decode it problem is you

431
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,920
need 785 giga traffic

432
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,959
um

433
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,160
so you need to be in a place where you

434
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,600
can intercept you need to be in a place

435
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
where you can for terabyte of traffic

436
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,759
almost a terabyte

437
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,600
in fact from the actual research paper

438
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
where they exploit this they have a

439
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
quote in our proof of concept demo this

440
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,720
attack currently takes less than two

441
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,560
days

442
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,639
um

443
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,839
but

444
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,519
keeping a web collection alive for two

445
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
days connection alive for two days may

446
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,599
not seem very practical but it worked in

447
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,000
the lab

448
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,280
so i i've reported sweet 32 multiple

449
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,359
times in in every report i've qa has had

450
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,839
sweet 32 in there at some point

451
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,720
listing the very ciphers

452
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,000
um

453
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,720
so

454
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,440
it's just more generalization um

455
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,160
about it so

456
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,440
and then so i'm just going to go into

457
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,679
conclusions

458
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,440
don't believe your tooling don't believe

459
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,200
the scores in your tooling

460
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,120
some things are just totally wrong you

461
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,880
use a bit of common sense

462
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,760
confirm what you find always confirmed

463
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,679
because something is just because nessa

464
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,280
says something is exploitable doesn't

465
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,720
mean it is

466
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,080
just because nicto says something

467
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
exploitable doesn't mean it is because

468
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
some of that stuff i wrote i was drunk

469
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,520
um

470
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,720
actually try and exploit stuff

471
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,360
just prove that you can do it

472
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,840
and score your risk appropriately don't

473
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,360
copy because it's not always right and

474
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,980
as long as you're consistent internally

475
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,720
[Applause]

476
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,640
and look at past vulnerabilities look at

477
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,000
those cves

478
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,080
look inside exploit db

479
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,160
make sure whether they're still valid

480
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,080
some of this stuff could do with fixing

481
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,120
but we have informational

482
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,039
vulnerabilities for that

483
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,919
let's just say to people some time

484
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,240
um and at that point i'm gonna ask for

485
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,919
questions because i race through my

486
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,440
slides

487
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
not that i'm nervous or anything but um

488
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,400
yeah

489
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,720
this is big sort of one that's difficult

490
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
to deal with so the question was is what

491
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
happens when your client pulls you up

492
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,039
and says oh sorry uh what haps when your

493
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,280
client pulls you up and says what you

494
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,320
say

495
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
isn't what's reported on nessus

496
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,600
um

497
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,039
what i say to that one is just be

498
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,760
prepared to explain your reasons why

499
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
half the reason why we export

500
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,080
why we report things is simply because

501
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,240
everybody else reports them

502
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,360
um

503
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,760
cookies for example we report because

504
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,039
everybody else reports and there's no

505
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,760
risk um you know android and obvious

506
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,120
skating files

507
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,799
yeah who cares

508
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,080
but report it because everybody else

509
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,679
does and if you don't report it your

510
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,320
customer will go why do you do that so i

511
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
would just say argue

512
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,799
get a movement to try and get everybody

513
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
to actually look at these things

514
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
properly

515
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,760
and maybe move things around

516
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,799
um oh

517
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,520
yep you sorry

518
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,009
[Music]

519
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,259
[Music]

520
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,799
so the question is is whether

521
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,480
vulnerability scanners

522
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,159
the people who produce vulnerability

523
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,559
scanners can start being educated on

524
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,400
this or whether we can raise i have

525
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,039
tried um there's actually a thread that

526
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,559
if you google my name you can actually

527
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,960
find where i think it was rob and i were

528
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,039
taking um

529
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
rapid seven to task for one of their

530
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
scores and they went

531
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,960
in the end we decided to keep it um

532
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,200
i'd love to do it i just need to

533
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,559
i

534
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,000
i think

535
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
it's probably one thing that we should

536
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,200
try and submit as bug reports every time

537
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,640
we see them but that adds overhead

538
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,760
so

539
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,559
i i'm happy for people to try

540
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,320
um i've had my fights with with the

541
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
tenable guys in the past

542
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,120
um

543
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,799
so but the more people who do it the

544
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,120
better

545
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
dave

546
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,559
you're not about hornets though

547
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,919
uh

548
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,158
um yeah

549
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,799
no live dangerously

550
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,280
i mean you guys are used to

551
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,280
yolo

552
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,720
classifying things based on your

553
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,720
environment

554
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,400
i mean i mean technically sis patton

555
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
though i have to assist for 10 years

556
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,640
because i let it expire um

557
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,440
is

558
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,880
we report stuff

559
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,960
risk management goes oh

560
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
that's not valid we'll rescore that for

561
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
our risk um

562
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,960
that's great for those big companies but

563
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,480
some of our customers

564
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
i've known more than hold of them put

565
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,080
together in it and i'm not being

566
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,480
big-headed about that it's just they

567
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
don't have any idea i literally had to

568
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
do a scope from somebody who went we

569
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
know nothing

570
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,240
we don't even know what a firewall is

571
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,280
so it's it's that's a great concept a

572
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,799
big company

573
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,120
little companies can't do that

574
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,000
so understand understand

575
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,960
and that's one to push so

576
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,280
at the back

577
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,600
so the question there was do we what do

578
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,440
you do when you find these sort of

579
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,159
things is i i normally turn them down to

580
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,440
informational

581
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,720
and that's what i sort of push when we

582
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
do qas as well

583
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,280
and i quite rant a bit because i'm quite

584
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,840
granty

585
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,679
so i try and try and turn them down to

586
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,440
information because some of the ones

587
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
it's like um

588
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
it's like compliance it's like getting

589
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,720
your password set to 27 characters

590
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,880
is a good idea but

591
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
you know it's not going to fix every

592
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
single problem

593
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
type thing so i try and migrate them

594
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,879
down because it's a good thing to do

595
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
stuart

596
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,120
yes

597
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,960
um

598
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,640
that's sort of where you have to give

599
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,320
feedback to the to the pentest firm but

600
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,600
that's a problem with the pen test

601
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,400
industry as a whole um

602
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,159
this is sort of half my argument is

603
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,919
downgrading this stuff that's irrelevant

604
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,840
to an info and then you can just go if

605
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
you don't fix it you don't fix it

606
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,200
concentrate on patching that server

607
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,279
because it's running something that's

608
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,799
two years out a day

609
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,159
that's where you should be comparing

610
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,880
because

611
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
um anybody's actually tried doing a real

612
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
world exploit of somewhere if you had

613
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,760
any red teamers in here

614
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,640
nope

615
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,960
the red team is generally they fish they

616
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,240
walk in somewhere they plug in the

617
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,799
network that's how they do it they don't

618
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,799
go oh i found

619
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,360
an e tag

620
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,039
the real world exploits you're going to

621
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,039
get are directly attacking your domains

622
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,360
so we'd rather you patch everything to

623
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,279
get up-to-date than just don't care

624
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,039
about the little things

625
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,159
so that's my sort of statement

626
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,840
and last one yeah

627
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,960
yes you can um sorry so the question is

628
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,880
is should we fix them anyway because

629
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,320
they might cause problems further down

630
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,799
the line so somebody will always install

631
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,600
it in d pro in d colon because that's it

632
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,559
and they'll have the permission set

633
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,080
badly in d column that happens um

634
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,880
it's

635
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,360
why you really should downgrade them to

636
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,760
is to lower the priority so if you got

637
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,320
you know a sql injection in your code

638
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,880
that's much more important to get fixed

639
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,039
um having a c column program is like a

640
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,480
minor thing that can go in a release at

641
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
some point

642
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,159
so it's not to stop people being

643
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,240
reporting this it's just to say don't

644
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,200
concentrate on the weak stuff

645
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,240
um reg

646
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,520
sorry i'm terrible with names

647
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,360
um

648
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,480
i declined to answer that question um

649
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
so the question is are there any vendors

650
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,760
who do scoring really well

651
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,279
none that i've seen

652
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,080
but

653
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,400
i i have quite ranty about cbss as well

654
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,200
but that's a different kettle of fish

655
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,480
um

656
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,000
so

657
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,080
i'm afraid that needs to be analyzed in

658
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,600
respect to your own risk department

659
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,320
that's cis patton um which i don't have

660
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
anymore um

661
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,240
any any more

662
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
right to the back scott

663
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,440
i didn't take the mick out your site

664
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,440
though

665
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,320
i think it comes from i can't remember

666
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,039
your name sorry i should know it

667
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,200
back to to yeah you

668
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,399
keith

669
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,919
what what uh keith said is is we report

670
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,679
stuff because our talks say stuff

671
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,799
and

672
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,120
everybody else says it so if if i do a

673
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,760
test then i'll if i don't say it if john

674
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,520
does a test there and he says it and

675
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,880
i'll get into trouble because i didn't

676
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,240
say it

677
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,399
so i think it's a bit of paranoia that

678
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,159
that

679
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,480
it was a good test because

680
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
um you didn't report this and it's not

681
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
trivial

682
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,799
so that that's generally where it comes

683
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,960
from

684
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,960
that's that's totally valid

685
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,080
um

686
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,039
and i i can't really i can't say

687
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,799
anything about that one because you know

688
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,880
there are reasons why

689
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,200
people report it it's very hard to get

690
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,880
into trouble for not reporting something

691
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,120
sorry for reporting something when it

692
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,520
when it when it's there

693
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,158
sorry samsung

694
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,799
so this started out of um a series of

695
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,200
blog posts i did um so i've only done

696
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,440
three so far and i do mean to continue

697
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,120
it because uh

698
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,720
it's just they take a long time to do

699
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,919
research on so if you look at our blog

700
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,039
pentespartners.com blog and if you

701
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,559
search for i think vulnerabilities that

702
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,000
aren't you'll find that you'll find the

703
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
articles there so if you do need to

704
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,600
argue it's like you can point them that

705
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,760
way

706
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,960
yeah but that's generally it so um

707
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,320
i'm going to say thank you and i do

708
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,039
apologize it's a bit short but you can

709
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,320
have half an hour of your life you can

710
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,480
get back
