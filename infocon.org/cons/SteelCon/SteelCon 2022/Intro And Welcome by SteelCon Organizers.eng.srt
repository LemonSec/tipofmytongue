1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,880
can

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,840
welcome still called 2022.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,929
[Music]

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
we are so glad to be back is it three

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,039
years off and

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,400
to be honest we've forgotten loads of

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,080
stuff everything's sort of trying to

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,600
remember how to do things but i think

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,439
we've got most of it right a few bits

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,359
got left at the last minute

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,720
unfortunately we ended up clashing with

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,039
tram lines which is why the the hotels

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,119
are so expensive why the parking might

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,558
be a bit full but

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,880
hopefully everybody got sorted

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,559
oh they're looking about half a room

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,920
full we still have a lot of bags and

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,520
stuff out there so i think there should

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,879
be quite a few people still making the

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,239
way in

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,320
but at least half of you have made it

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,840
which is good

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,800
right boring bit to get started uh we're

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,960
not expecting a fire drill today

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,360
if there is a continuous alarm it's

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
evacuate by our doors dot all over the

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,160
place just get yourselves out you're all

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,680
adults you're all wearing hi-vis vests

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,239
you know what to do

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,479
do we like the badges

31
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,080
but perfect for those physical

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,760
assessments and trying to sneak into

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,040
places

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
um this is the sort of second iteration

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,960
we did have some other ideas for badges

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,439
this year they didn't quite work out so

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,840
um we got this sorted

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
i gotta say big thanks to a guy paul

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
craig who is a sheffield printer he

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,360
sorted out badges the cable tie boxes

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,159
that you uh boxes that you got

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,119
the

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,000
bags he printed it all for us in town

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and he stored it all

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
and if you've seen any of the photos of

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
the amount of swag we've got

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
he just filled his warehouse it was

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,119
brilliant saved me having stories hope

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,200
so big thanks to craig for sorting it

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,600
all for us

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,119
we've had

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,119
uh let's say on twitter somebody

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,159
claiming that they're going to try and

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,680
sneak in and they they're going to

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,960
social engineer the way in and all that

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560
kind of stuff so we are going to be

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,399
checking badges this time

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
try and keep your badges at least on you

59
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,719
and uh and if you're challenged then

60
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,640
yeah just show it

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
if we do catch the person that is trying

62
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,000
to sneak in they will be thrown out

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
right sponsors

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
up until a certain point we had no

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,200
sponsors it was all really quiet

66
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
and uh we were getting worried

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
and then somehow with the amazing work

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,239
of mike it's away from kind of no no

69
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,160
none and then we got flooded with people

70
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
wanted to sponsor i don't know whether

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,120
it was

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
just sort of an end of season thing or

73
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
whatever happened but we're going to

74

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,599
atrium was being rebuilt a few years ago

108
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,680
and there isn't anywhere else in the

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
area that is practical enough to do what

110

134
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
stuff we've got to go through

136
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400

140
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,800
is this going to work yes you are

141
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,680
currently in penang it's over here if

142
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
you walk through between all the

143
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,039
sponsors

144
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,039
track three norfolk is right at the very

145
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,720
other end so just walk that way keep

146
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,479
going

147
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,720
track two which is peak is up the stairs

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,479
or up the list to level five

149
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,639
the lifts i've got a mind of their own

150
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,639
work out how to use them if you dare if

151
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,960
not just tip stairs if you can

152
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,039
there is another lift down this head

153
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
this end near norfolk that is just a

154
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,039
nice normal press button lift

155
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,960
so if that one freaks you out go for the

156
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,479
nice normal one

157
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,120
um other things to point out

158
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
very you've all got water bottles in

159
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,639
your bags we thought of that before the

160
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,440
heat wave we're just ahead of our time

161
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
as you go out of the right-hand door of

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,479
here

163
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,639
there is a fountain for filling water

164
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,720
bottles there are a few others on other

165
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,960
levels as well so to keep yourself

166
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,039
hydrated we want anybody passing out or

167
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,039
having problems with that

168
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,120

we've got

219
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,080
the daft thing about buying the goodie

220
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,400
bag stuff for you guys is

221
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
some of the

222
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
sellers they have a price break at 500

223
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,000
units and it's cheaper to buy 500 than

224
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,599
it is to buy 450.

225
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,199
so for some of the things like the water

226
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,080
bottles we have got at least 50 spare so

227
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,039
we'll be putting all those out on the uh

228
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,800

231
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000

233
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,599

234
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,160
into the boxes i'll move around and get

235
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,440
sold off because

236
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,560
somebody will want it somewhere

237
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,199
charities this year um back on bliss

238
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,560
which is one we've been sporting for the

239
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,479
start

240
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,400
and um

241
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
we also

242
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,360
after buying all the goodie bags stuff

243
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,440
we had about 400 quid left let's try to

244
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,719
work out what to do with it i couldn't

245
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,799
really buy anything decent with it so

246
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
i'll put a poll up on twitter wish you

247
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,399
like the most bees butterflies or trees

248
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,958
and it turns out hackers like bees just

249
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,320
about

250
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,040
so we have put it um i look at the

251
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
different bee charities and the bumble

252
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
bee conservation trust

253
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,560
they're doing a project in the peak

254
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,839
district which if you don't know you

255
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,320
look geography huge chunk of sheffield

256
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,160
is in the peak district so it's kind of

257
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
it's local for us

258
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,240
so with that spare 400 quid we put that

259
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,800
into the british b charity

260
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,680
so

261
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,959
you got a little bit less in your goodie

262
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,800
bags but the charity's got some cash out

263
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,440
of it and that's if you if you make a

264
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
donation sticky start it will get split

265
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
somehow between those two

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
bad news no party this year

267
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
good news we're off we're doing an after

268
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,600
conference social

269
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,640
well

270
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,240
if works pay for your ticket then yes

271
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
it's a work event

272
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,000
um right so obviously if anybody's been

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,519
been in the past you know we've used the

274
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,560
hubs for the party the hubs is no longer

275
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
bookable as a social venue for parties

276
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
and things so we've had to move into the

277
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,480
university itself so we're not going

278
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,600
through the student union we're going

279
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,440
through the university the university

280
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
doesn't do parties as in things like

281
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,320
birthday parties and hen do's and stuff

282
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
they do socials

283
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,320
so we're having an after conference

284
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,160
social

285
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
uh where is it it is straight upstairs

286
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,399
so where you came in through the main

287
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,320
doors and you went through the weird

288
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,240
lifts there's a set of stairs on your

289
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
left just go up those stairs we've got

290
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,079

291
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,519

292
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,800
flat space

293

food court we've got same as the old

295
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,600
place probably a bit more space

296
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,720
but of course we haven't got the open

297
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,880
air balcony but i i think it's good

298
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
trade-off we've got a decent space for

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000

so not the center not the entertainment

463
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,920
one not the one out of ten you've got to

466
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,519
