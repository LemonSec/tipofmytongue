1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,520
let's move on so today we're going to be

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,000
talking about

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,800
i'll take hacking for 100 keeping your

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,280
cta costs out of jeopardy

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,400
so

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,720
first things first

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,240
um don't take everything that i say is

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,240
gospel just know that i practice what i

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,920
preach so we're going to be breaking

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
everything down into four main

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,720
categories and this is just kind of

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,960
stuff that i picked up over the years

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
first things first

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
what is a ctf so a child trust fund is a

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,079
long-term tax free savings account for

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,360
children born between the 1st of

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,960
september 20 2002 and 2nd december 2011.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,760
it is also a counter-terrorism financing

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
for the hmrc's approach to reduce the

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
threat of terrorist financing by

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,879
detecting preventing

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
deterring and disrupting the flow of

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,680
terrorist finance

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,960
right

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
activity the l expression the

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,119
development petrol de tunisia

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,840
i think there are petrol pumping

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,080
what a ctf actually is

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,159
is stands for capture the flag if you're

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
new here you probably already know what

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,280
the ctf does

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,320
but

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
we're going to do a quick brief rundown

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,360
of ctfs and how they've diversified

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,600
so starting off with jeopardy so this is

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,960
the most common format that a lot of

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,320
people will come against

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,520
as you can see

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,040
it's broken ends in categories of the

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,840
top

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,439
plus the score on the

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,360
uh going down this is a very easy

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,560
representation of difficulty as well

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,399
and teams race to get the most amount of

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,840
points in a limited time so that's

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,079
that's pretty common

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,560
the next ones are kind of uh attack and

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,920
defense so

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,159
you've got things like with red versus

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,960
blue

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,479
these are two teams who have nominated

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,159
they're going to be doing offensive or

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
defensive work

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,439
blue team is tasked with maintaining

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,079
services and defending against attacks

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,680
while blue team or sorry we all red

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,799
teams

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,520
are

59
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,960
tasked with trying to compromise the

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,878
blue team servers

61
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,318
then you've got things like king of the

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,239
hill so this is kind of where you've got

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,920
the teams are a bit mixed but they're

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
trying to take over central server where

65
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,720
anyone is up for grabs

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
and so typically have things like the

67
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
red teamers would go in

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
they get in leave the door open for the

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,040
blue teamers who can then secure

70
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
everything and try and hold on for as

71
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
long as possible

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
then you've got some new stuff which is

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
things like hack the box battleground so

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,640
these are you've got a list of typically

75
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,599
four servers and each team is made of

76
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,200
four different teammates and you have to

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,959
try and compromise the servers as

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,760
quickly as you can

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,319
so non-traditional ctfs

80
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,360
these are kind of the ones that have

81
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
sprung up are kind of an interesting way

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
of looking at um the new stuff that's

83
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
out there so

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
you've got for example the defcon

85
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,519
scavenger hunt this is you know collect

86
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,680
as many wacky wild things as you can

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,000
you've got the tracelab ctfs this is you

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
know using osint for good to try and

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
help track down missing persons and a

90
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,760
local authorities you've got boss of the

91
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,239
sock this is you know your typical blue

92
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,840
team what it's actually kind of like to

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
be an analyst and so on

94
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
um then you've got correct me if you

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,159
can't this is you know password cracking

96
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,000
how to actually improve it based on word

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,159
lists and better techniques and so on

98
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,040
and then you've got the mr robot arg

99
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
which is sort of like long-running

100
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
challenges that ran over the entire

101
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,480
series to give you easter eggs and more

102
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,000
of an insight into the characters and so

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
on

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,239
so

105
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,000
that's an introduction to ctfs now we're

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
going to be talking about scope so scope

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
is we're just going to start with the

108
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,200
big stuff

109
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
so when you're doing your ctf what you

110
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,879
want to try and do is figure out some of

111
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,799
the big questions that come with it so a

112
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,239
lot of this stuff is things like how

113
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,680
long has it gone for where is it

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,799
happening

115
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,879
what kind of timing and so on and this

116
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,159
will give you a better understanding as

117
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,480
to how to cater a lot of your content

118
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,760
down the line

119
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,159
so

120
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,360
main things that you want to watch out

121
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
for when you're dealing with this is

122
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,599
keep in mind other events that will be

123
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,599
happening at the same time

124
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
you don't want to overlap with

125
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,200
defcon or black hat or anything else

126
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
like that and find out that no one's

127
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
showing up you also want to consider are

128
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
you catering towards teams or

129
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
individuals if you do that

130
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,199
it kind of has a knock-on effect onto

131
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,320
your technical requests you know the

132
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
amount of database requests and so on

133
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,919
individually versus teams is a bit lower

134
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,840
but also you want to try and figure out

135
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,160
when are the biggest spikes during your

136
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,080
competition so a lot of them will be

137
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,160
things like at the beginning you know as

138
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,440
soon as we find out that the challenge

139
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,199
has started it won't hammer the server

140
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,960
and then at the end it's a major crunch

141
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
to try and get as much as you can in but

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,840
then you might have some other stuff

143
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,199
that would happen at the same time so

144
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
for example at lunchtime everyone's

145
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,120
going away get food and then suddenly

146
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
they come back and they just you know

147
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,199
slam them

148
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,960
and keep in mind

149
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
when you're trying to cater your ctf who

150
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,639
is your target audience

151
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
so these are things like

152
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
are you targeting

153
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,960
industry vets students kids teachers

154
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,479
just because someone's got technical

155
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
experience in the field doesn't

156
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,840
necessarily mean that it carries over to

157
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
cts and especially when you're designing

158
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
your things

159
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,160
a lot of challenges might

160
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
go with all right just get the flag get

161
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
root and that's fine but that's not

162
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,759
always applicable to people in the

163
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,479
industry so they might not get that

164
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
also try and figure out what ages you're

165
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
catering for again

166
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
if you're going for students they're

167
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
going to be a little bit more techy but

168
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,639
if you're going for

169
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,160
younger kids you want to try and make it

170
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,199
as accessible but also kind of ramp up

171
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,800
the difficulty to go and i'll get into

172
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,639
this with um

173
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,919
some of the stuff later on and then

174
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
likewise you know are you targeting blue

175
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,560
teamers or red teamers and so on

176
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,000
then you kind of get into some of the

177
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,479
meta stuff that's there as well now

178
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,759
if you're

179
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,199
are you running a theme are you going to

180
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,880
be dealing with charity is this going to

181
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,319
be raising money or is it just for your

182
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,919
own club

183
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,680
if you are running something for charity

184
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,960
or non-profit

185
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
you could tie it in so for example if

186
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,639
you've got if you're trying to raise

187
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,160
money for child's play you could do like

188
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,319
a kids hacking workshop and go okay

189
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,440
that's great

190
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,319
um

191
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,680
if you are making something

192
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
family-friendly

193
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,039
it doesn't have to be tied to kids it

194
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,560
doesn't have to be aimed at them it just

195
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
means that you can make it a bit more

196
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,479
inclusive so things to consider are if

197
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,000
you've got a team of say

198
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
14 year olds and they're doing their

199
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,479
thing

200
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,680
they're probably going to ask their

201
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
parents for help does that mean that's

202
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,440
also part of the team do you want to

203
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
split them up or be that strict

204
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
um

205
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,960
if you are including

206
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,319
younger players

207
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,479
just be aware that some services as well

208
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,520
also require you to be 13 years older so

209
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,120
things like discord for example maybe

210
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,199
you'd overclouding

211
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,199
um

212
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,080
likewise if you can figure out your

213
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,680
completion rate

214
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
this will help you figure out how many

215
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,520
challenges you need to provide for your

216
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
audience again if you're targeting

217
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,639
younger kids they might take a little

218
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,759
bit longer because they're not entirely

219
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,880
sure how ctf works or that kind of stuff

220
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,639
so

221
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,560
uh

222
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,160
yeah we'll move on to the next one

223
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
when you are

224
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,880
so

225
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,800
again this is kind of a meta thing

226
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,599
trying to figure out if you are making

227
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,319
your competition quite competitive is it

228
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,240
educational is it fun

229
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,599
if you look at the different services

230
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,800
that are out there right now you've got

231
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
devcon that's you know highly

232
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,160
competitive cutthroat go go go that's

233
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,919
exactly where trying to go for

234
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,599
it doesn't matter if

235
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,960
not enough people pick up your

236
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,039
challenges or complete them because

237
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,479
these are meant to be the best of the

238
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,000
best so

239
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,840
it's up to them to get it but if you're

240
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
trying to do something like teach

241
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
someone a concept or introduce them to

242
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
hacking or something like that

243
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
you want to make sure that you have a

244
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
high completion rate because then that

245
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,479
way people are understanding what you're

246
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,080
trying to put down

247
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
they're trying to collaborate with

248
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,240
things like that

249
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
and so on

250
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,240
you also have some fun challenges as

251
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,440
well again

252
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,120
you don't have to focus on completion

253
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
right there but think about is this

254
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
something to showcase the cool exploit

255
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
is this the new cool thing like

256
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,879
logjam heartbleed whatever just an

257
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,720
interesting way to try and tie that into

258
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,759
something else

259
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,039
if you look at the different services

260
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,560
that are out there you've got like

261
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,639
defcons the competitive stuff try hack

262
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
me hack the box those kind of things are

263
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,280
kind of

264
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,720
you know about competitive but also

265
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,840
educational

266
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,159
if you look at vonhub for example

267
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,599
they don't have a leaderboard it's just

268
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,559
a case of cool download a vm play around

269
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,159
with it do what you can

270
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,839
um

271
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,320
lastly when you're looking at your scope

272
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,680
are you going to be doing it in a

273
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
physical space or is it a virtual space

274
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,680
and each of them have their own

275
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
different considerations to watch out

276
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,399
for so

277
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,080
for example if you're in a physical

278
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,399
space how many plugs do you have is the

279
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
infrastructure wi-fi available good

280
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,080
enough for what you've got

281
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
is there enough seating uh what's the

282
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,800
kovitz policy at this space if you do

283
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,680
something

284
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,200
virtual it can be a little bit more

285
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,320
difficult to advertise get the word out

286
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,360
you don't need to worry about things

287
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
like a covert policy but

288
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
it is open to the internet or it can be

289
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,640
open to the internet it's easier to

290
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
abuse

291
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,880
likewise if you do it virtual

292
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
it's very easy to run on costs and you

293
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
do not want to wake up with a big bill

294
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,200
an interesting use case of this is that

295
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,080
this is actually generator in dublin so

296
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,000
zero days is a ctf that runs every year

297
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,720
in april and to try and tackle this

298
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
issue they were originally setting up in

299
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,240
hotels in dublin but they found that

300
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,519
they had

301
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,120
difficulties with you know power and

302
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
venue and all that kind of stuff

303
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,760
before they'd self-hosted their kit and

304
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,839
put a switch on all the different tables

305
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,160
and just said okay connect up to that

306
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
here's the ip address of the competition

307
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
go nuts

308
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,800
but this time they decided to go with

309
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,600
aws now this meant that they had ample

310
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,519
seating it was very easy to organize

311
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
everyone could sit wherever they wanted

312
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
but it also meant that when they were

313
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,000
creating their challenges you had to

314
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
make sure you know nothing was using

315
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,200
brute force or harming the

316
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
infrastructure that kind of stuff

317
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,720
it also meant that afterwards they had a

318
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,399
great venue for the after party so

319
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,800
that's something to consider as well

320
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,320
right so

321
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
scoping out the details we've done that

322
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,519
and this is the easiest way that you can

323
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,680
figure out and reduce your costs because

324
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,040
once you've got your scope down you

325
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,839
don't have to worry about that

326
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,760
next we're going to look at design now

327
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,040
there's lots of different ways that you

328
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,399
can design a challenge but one of the

329
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,160
interesting ways that i came across is

330
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,880
so my partner is a ux designer and as a

331
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
result you know he tells me about these

332
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
cool things that come across such as a

333
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
design system so in ux the design

334
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
systems like a set of design standards

335
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
that describe your product so you've got

336
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,600
documentation principles how they

337
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
inherit sorry how they implement the

338
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,839
toolkit layouts you know all that kind

339
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,600
of stuff

340
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
and it basically means that you don't

341
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,760
have to reinvent the wheel

342
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,480
so when you're looking at this for a ctf

343
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,160
you can basically do the same thing

344
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,079
describe every facet of a challenge

345
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,880
right so your name the description

346
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,240
whatever else

347
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,959
this makes collaboration a lot easier

348
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,120
because you're basically talking about

349
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,959
everything what kind of difficulties for

350
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,040
what kind of points it is common stuff

351
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
which often gets tripped up is things

352
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,040
like your flag format you might say that

353
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
you've got a challenge

354
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,399
to give to someone else not a problem

355
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,760
it's already been done from another

356
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
competition but then they've got a

357
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,079
different flag former which

358
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,720
it's not difficult to change on the

359
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,320
infrastructure but it's a bit of a pain

360
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,839
and then sometimes it's just not

361
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,440
standard so if you can

362
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
you know it looks better if it's all the

363
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,120
same

364
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
um

365
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
then you've got a style guide so style

366
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,959
guide in

367
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,120
if you look at design systems from a ux

368
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
point of view there's sort of like a

369
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
high level set of guidelines whereas the

370
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,519
style guide

371
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,519
is a low level set of rules that kind of

372
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,000
describe each component individually so

373
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,519
in this case

374
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,399
you've got here this is the gov.uk

375
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,600
style guide

376
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,440
and as you can see whenever you're

377
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
talking about anything so bank details

378
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,560
you say okay when you're paying and go

379
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
from body use spaces rather than hyphens

380
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
inside in sword codes

381
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
you know you've got a list of bad words

382
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,720
here's the words to avoid technical text

383
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,200
and so on use back end not

384
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,519
back end and so on and

385
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,320
just a quick side note glove.uk all

386
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
their stuff they've got so much open

387
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,279
source stuff that it's surprising

388
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,839
considering it's a government

389
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,680
body but anyway you can use this to try

390
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,279
and outline some stuff like for example

391
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,360
with forensics you know any of your

392
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,040
challenges have to be a maximum of 50

393
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,399
megs in size

394
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,560
if it's a docker image it has to be able

395
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,399
to fit on a you know t2 nano and that

396
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,000
kind of stuff and these just kind of

397
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,760
standardize it make it a lot easier to

398
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
work with

399
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
now what's interesting is that

400
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,120
until recently a lot of competitions

401
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,760
didn't have a stock ads but defcon i

402
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,800
think is one of the few that have

403
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,240
started to brought it in and you can see

404
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,279
this here

405
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
they basically have a blog post that

406
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,200
describes all the different aspects of

407
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,440
defcon 29 so you've got things like you

408
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,639
know what kind of font do they use what

409
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,320
kind of palette what's the key phrase

410
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
these are the inspirations that describe

411
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,519
what they're trying to achieve with

412
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,360
defcon 29

413
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,399
and

414
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,720
this basically bleeds down into the

415
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,480
villages the competitions and so on i

416
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,600
kind of unify under one roof reinforcing

417
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,360
the idea that we're all part of the same

418
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,880
tribe and this is kind of the same with

419
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,959
every def con they try and say we are

420
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,399
all in the same group you're not alone

421
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,079
now

422
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,600
as a quick aside

423
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,800
one of the best ways to

424
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,800
do a bit of a litmus test for your

425
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,680
players

426
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,560
is what i call baby's first flag so this

427
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,399
is nothing special

428
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,920
essentially what you're trying to do is

429
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,399
you're trying to

430
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,440
uh

431
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
make sure that the the user is able to

432
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,680
use your platform right so this is all

433
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,160
very simple stuff it's just like

434
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,360
enter this

435
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,120
into the flag text

436
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,639
to get the flag and you get you know

437
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
poultry 10 points or whatever very easy

438
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,440
very easy to incentivize but

439
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
this makes sure that if a user is able

440
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,320
to do this they can get through

441
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,600
all the different challenges of

442
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,399
registering so platforms online emails

443
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,040
working captions working they can read

444
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,639
which sometimes that's not always the

445
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,920
case

446
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,440
but more importantly they can submit a

447
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,639
flag

448
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,920
so this means that they are able to

449
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,519
complete the basic user journey for

450
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,279
using your platform and then if they

451
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,639
have any other issues they can move on

452
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,000
to that

453
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
right so it's also a good one to use as

454
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,560
an example

455
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,279
for

456
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,720
other challenge designers so if you're

457
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
on the same team you can say look this

458
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,519
is what i expect you to do here's the

459
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
format blah blah blah blah blah

460
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,800
so pico ctf is a very interesting

461
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
um group at the moment they basically

462
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,880
started in carnegie mellon university

463
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,360
launched in

464
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,800
2013 by a student group and

465
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
when they started off it was you know 6k

466
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,000
participants all great the main thing i

467
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,480
want to highlight is first of all

468
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,320
they make the challenges that they've

469
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,800
got available to anyone right so they

470
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
have a new platform that's available

471
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,639
called pikachu and it means that you can

472
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,880
basically submit if as

473
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,639
the competition happens

474
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,240
you're not happy about works or you want

475
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,680
to try it later on

476
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,000
you can take a look at all challenges

477
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
the current ones and so on see how it

478
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,639
works

479
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,240
and just basically play around with it

480
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
at your own pace

481
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,600
now this is important because they've

482
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,759
written two papers about

483
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,639
using ctf to try and

484
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,440
get

485
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
um

486
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,800
kids interested in hacking so the two

487
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,560
main ones were

488
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
problem generation for capture the flag

489
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,639
competitions that was basically about

490
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,399
making unique challenges dynamically

491
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,720
creating challenges and basically making

492
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,920
something where you can go okay we're

493
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
going to talk about forensic forensics

494
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,839
today how do you make a forensics

495
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,440
challenge and you just go blam there's

496
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,800
one ready made

497
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
and this means that whoever's the the

498
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,639
players that are

499
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,560
going through the challenge

500
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,000
it's you know improved education

501
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
experience as a result

502
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
then you've got

503
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
um the

504
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,560
other white paper which is how to avoid

505
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,440
scaring players away sorry how to avoid

506
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
scaring students away in a ctf

507
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,240
competition

508
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,320
now the summary of this one is basically

509
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
they were trying to gear their ctf

510
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,320
challenges towards younger audiences

511
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,240
like we're talking like eight nine ten

512
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,800
year olds and the way that they did it

513
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,519
is they started very easy and very

514
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,839
slowly ramped it up and they found that

515
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,600
as you introduced more introductory

516
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,959
challenge very beginner friendly

517
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,000
challenges

518
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,560
then the kids loved it because they just

519
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,240
they go through it very quickly and then

520
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,279
that means that they're not as

521
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,959
intimidated to move on to some of the

522
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,600
more difficult stuff

523
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,639
um

524
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,399
briefly out of the pico ctf

525
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,000
uh stuff came to play parliament of

526
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,799
pawning which is their own capture the

527
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,919
flag team

528
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,520
who've been you know doing leaps and

529
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,799
bounds they're one of the best ones that

530
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,919
are out there on the planet now and it

531
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,119
means that they actually run their own

532
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,160
ctf as well called play ctf

533
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,400
so what i want to do next is what's

534
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
interesting is with uh carnegie mellon

535
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,559
sorry with pico ctf

536
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,760
in the last couple years they've

537
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,599
actually they outsource

538
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,039
a lot of their challenge creation to

539
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,599
students who are studying for um cyber

540
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,559
courses

541
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,760
but

542
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,720
they're using that as a way to try and

543
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
grade some students now what's

544
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,120
interesting is that with these there's a

545
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
little bit of a distinction between the

546
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,799
quality in these now i'm not critiquing

547
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,640
them necessarily but i'm just

548
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,919
highlighting some interesting stuff that

549
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,840
came out of

550
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,880
it um

551
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,320
let's just take a quick drink before we

552
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,799
go into that

553
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,760
so first of all

554
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,320
let's look at the description itself

555
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,240
on the left hand side you've got stunts

556
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,280
so

557
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,440
the description for this

558
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
it's very vague it's not very clear

559
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,880
exactly what you're trying to do how you

560
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,679
actually solve this challenge

561
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,679
even in the hints itself

562
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,520
it's like oh okay well maybe if you can

563
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
find a my api key you'll be able to do

564
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,640
it

565
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
now keep in mind this is a 20 points

566
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,559
challenge this is meant to be one of the

567
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,559
most easy stuff and at this point you're

568
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,919
expected to do

569
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,400
you know web reverse engineering maybe

570
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,919
opponent server that kind of stuff

571
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,000
you're given the source code for a c

572
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
file and then you're told okay use

573
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
netcat to try and get into it and then

574
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,360
talks about an api key and it's like

575
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,559
what this is meant to be something

576
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,240
that's you know the first thing that

577
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
people will come across

578
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,840
so the points to effort is well

579
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,320
compare that to matrices

580
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
now this is

581
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,280
pretty low points effort is a little bit

582
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
still askew but the important thing is

583
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,919
that the description is a lot clearer

584
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,360
can you find the final image here's the

585
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
final image the hint is a lot more

586
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,480
useful as well you can hide files and

587
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
find in other files

588
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,559
this one is a standard stego challenge

589
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,280
all you need to do is use stack hide to

590
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
extract the image and then do it a

591
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
couple of different times and then away

592
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
you go

593
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,120
now

594
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,200
in a standard user journey they have to

595
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,240
learn about stack hide and

596
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
staggernography it's a little bit of a

597
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
dangerous territory but as you can see

598
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,280
here

599
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
the number of people who attempted and

600
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,799
solved the challenge

601
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,760
with stonks is a lot lower compared to

602
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,039
treshkadal

603
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,240
and then again

604
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,480
you have this additional

605
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,160
metric which is how many people actually

606
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,840
liked it you might have solved it but

607
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,679
you might not be happy with the result

608
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,960
you can see on this one that's a lot

609
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,039
higher

610
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,160
so again

611
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,679
we've got another one which is same idea

612
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,720
but what's interesting is that with

613
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,039
uh like 100

614
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,840
the description isn't quite clear but if

615
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,600
you combine that with

616
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,440
you know the description the name and

617
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,720
the hint

618
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,159
it's pretty clear that all you need to

619
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,720
do is basically untie this file you got

620
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,080
to do it a thousand times and then with

621
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,760
the hint it says okay well you just

622
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,600
gotta script this but if you look at

623
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,039
information

624
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,559
it's not very clear and the hint itself

625
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,039
is quite redundant you know it tells you

626
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,480
here's the flag formula but you already

627
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,559
know because it's there

628
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,720
likewise the points to effort ratio is

629
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,520
completely off like 100 gives you 250

630
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,120
points this is almost what would be

631
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,360
considered a medium challenge but if you

632
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,360
can script it easy not a problem

633
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,200
so once you've got your design out of

634
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,240
the way

635
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,200
let's look at infrastructure and hosting

636
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,320
so

637
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,520
when you're looking at your

638
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,720
infrastructure the first thing you want

639
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,640
to do is look at platforms this is what

640
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,480
people are going to be interacting with

641
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,240
when they're actually trying to solve

642
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,760
your challenges and so on there's lots

643
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600
of different ones that are out there i

644
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
prefer ctfd because it's one of the more

645
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,960
mature stuff that that's there pico ctf

646
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,039
is you know fantastic as well but the

647
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,360
only problem is they stop making their

648
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
platform open source in 2019 still works

649
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,840
great and there's nothing stopping you

650
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,159
from running it

651
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,679
but each of them have their own sort of

652
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,679
plus and minuses if you think about your

653
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,200
platform as kind of like a content

654
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,360
distribution system like wordpress

655
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,039
it's just meant to be a front for the

656
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,960
users you're you're front end basically

657
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,480
but that handles things like user

658
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
management scoreboard rules that kind of

659
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,840
stuff

660
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,679
and there's also a fantastic list that

661
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,120
i'd recommend called

662
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,760
awesome ctf platforms which just goes

663
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,039
into a massive depth of all the

664
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,520
different ones that are out there

665
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,600
um when you're actually trying to figure

666
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,360
out infrastructure first of all start

667
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
with the minimum viable product get to

668
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,600
know how your infrastructure works and

669
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,840
the easiest thing you can do is just get

670
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,600
yourself a raspberry pi get some old

671
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
computer hell use your own computer or a

672
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,679
laptop if you've got it

673
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,480
set up the ctf platform your database

674
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
your file hosting see how it works see

675
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,600
how it tinkers with you've got

676
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,039
experience with this kind of stuff

677
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,600
already great

678
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
but then move on to making it maybe a

679
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,919
single vm just it's a basic web server

680
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,520
it's got a local database it just you

681
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
know uploads onto the file system

682
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
then ideally you try and make it a bit

683
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
more scalable so

684
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
from a vm to a container

685
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,200
a local database to maybe a cluster or a

686
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,600
relation database or even just you know

687
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,880
random db server that kind of stuff

688
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,480
integrate cloud storage and that kind of

689
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
thing this gives you a better idea as to

690
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,400
figure out your costs per head

691
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,760
because then you can go all right if

692
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,120
you've got a really

693
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,919
good

694
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,320
if you've just got your ctf platform and

695
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,360
you've got

696
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
a thousand people who are trying to use

697
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,679
your system at once how many instances

698
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,520
do i need am i able to scale it up and

699
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,039
shrink it down dynamically depending on

700
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,799
demand same thing with the different

701
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,159
challenges

702
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,080
once you've got that then you can kind

703
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
of integrate the other services that are

704
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,360
available depending on you know if

705
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,520
you're self-hosting or using cloud you

706
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,039
can kind of implement some extra stuff

707
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,640
so for example

708
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,720
you know elastic load balancing with uh

709
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,760
aws or traffic redirection fault alerts

710
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,400
monitoring all that kind of stuff now if

711
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
you go with anything to do with cloud

712
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,440
it's going to add some extra cost but

713
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
you know it's something that it's nice

714
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,440
to have the tools that are there

715
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,679
especially with monitoring

716
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,360
on the day it's very important to be

717
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,039
able to keep an eye on this because you

718
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,200
might find hey you know ten percent of

719
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
your traffic is being dropped mid

720
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,039
competition what's going on maybe the vm

721
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,720
is broken or something like that you

722
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,000
wanna try and make it as easy as

723
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,080
possible for people to

724
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,440
you know have a good experience and

725
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,280
having technical issues is not a good

726
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,799
thing to do

727
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,520
but it also allows you to monitor

728
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
your completion rate again you know are

729
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,919
people solving all of your stuff very

730
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,159
quickly very slowly do you need to do it

731
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,600
in batches

732
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,559
and

733
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,080
maybe lower the difficulty or release

734
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,520
more hints for your different challenges

735
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
that are out there

736
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,640
so looking at the different hosting

737
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,400
options that are out there you basically

738
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,600
have

739
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,640
cloud

740
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,240
or self-hosting

741
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
now

742
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,120
with cloud stuff

743
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
there's no ceiling on the resources that

744
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,039
are available so there's also no limit

745
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,480
on the cost

746
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,520
um

747
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,679
if you want to try and

748
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,200
make things a bit more efficient you can

749
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
kind of roll your own services to

750
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,919
replace some of the things that are on

751
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,159
there so for example instead of elastic

752
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,799
load balancing you'd use h8 proxy and

753
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,279
again try and get it to scale and so on

754
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,200
but as i go into later

755
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,279
that can be a little bit of a headache

756
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,440
the benefit with cloud is that there's

757
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,039
lots of documentation on there you can

758
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,520
learn everything that's available and

759
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
the services try and encourage you to

760
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,279
use them

761
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
at a cost

762
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,960
but you can easily self-host your stuff

763
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,640
as well again if you know how many

764
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,159
people are going to be playing based on

765
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,919
your scope then that gives you a better

766
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,440
idea as to how much resources you

767
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,760
actually need you could run a ctf on a

768
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,840
raspberry pi because you're just using a

769
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,120
web server

770
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,240
but

771
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,000
what happens if you get slammed beyond

772
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,840
just understand

773
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,919
the difficulties that come with reaching

774
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,440
that ceiling and if you're prepared to

775
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,919
deal with that

776
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,240
so this is the actual meat and bones of

777
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,120
it

778
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,320
when you're trying to keep your costs

779
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,120
low

780
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,039
figure out your scope that's the main

781
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,600
thing the second thing is

782
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,360
know the limitations of the gear that

783
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,919
you've got and your budget especially so

784
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,840
if you've got 400 pounds

785
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,799
for

786
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,480
all of your infrastructure and then

787
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,679
suddenly you find out that it's much

788
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,679
more popular than it should be

789
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,600
are you accepted to pay more

790
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
do you just want to pause it or do you

791
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,640
want to try and bring that down

792
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
to a more acceptable level but then that

793
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
means the players have additional wait

794
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,320
times or you have to cut off and kill

795
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,720
some challenges and things like that

796
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,600
you can use things like free tiers

797
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,279
creatively to try and get more

798
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,520
utilization so for example

799
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,400
let's say you've got aws does a free

800
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,159
tier available for

801
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,720
um a bunch of different things including

802
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,360
tier 2 nanos they give you 750 hours a

803
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,000
month it refreshes and

804
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
if you run that box constantly

805
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
throughout the month that basically

806
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,880
means that it's about one month's supply

807
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
so not an issue you can run a blog or

808
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,039
something like that on it however

809
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,799
depending on the timing of your event if

810
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,720
it's at the beginning of the month and

811
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,760
that means if you're only running

812
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,240
something for 24 hours cool you can

813
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,000
bring up a bunch of different services

814
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,880
and basically burn through that 750

815
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,120
hours very easily

816
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,720
but it means that you can come up

817
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,480
against whatever traffic and things like

818
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
that certainly very easily

819
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,240
what else we've got here so

820
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,320
you can save a lot of money by rolling

821
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,960
your own systems but in doing so

822
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,240
you kind of

823
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,520
it's very easy to go down the rabbit

824
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,960
hole so as i mentioned before you can

825
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,000
use henchy proxy instead of

826
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
elastic load balancer but then you have

827
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,559
the extra technical debt of trying to

828
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,039
keep that up and running yourself

829
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,039
um

830
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,240
what else we got here oh

831
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
try and utilize some extra services that

832
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,840
you've got there already so for example

833
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,679
if you've got dropbox plus because maybe

834
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,279
you're a student or you just pay for it

835
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,039
anyway that's a great way to save some

836
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,640
money because you can use that for some

837
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
extra storage and i'll come into that in

838
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,840
the next slide

839
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,400
but be wary if you're using any free

840
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,360
tiers

841
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,080
um some of the cloud stuff

842
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,720
is fine you know it works just like any

843
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,159
other enterprise gear but if you're

844
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,320
using a free tier of

845
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,919
dropbox for example they only allow a

846
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,039
certain amount of requests before they

847
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,799
shut it down

848
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,799
and if you can utilize what you've got

849
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,640
already so if you've got you know a

850
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,080
local uni or something like that they're

851
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,679
like hey do you want some you know

852
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,039
servers or things like that these are

853
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,799
cheap they're out of date and they sound

854
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,120
like a jet engine trying to take off but

855
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,559
it's free kit you could use that if you

856
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,760
need to

857
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
um try and keep things simple especially

858
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,880
when you're trying to debug it because

859
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,760
if you've got all these different

860
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,720
systems

861
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
it might be very cheap but that's a pain

862
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,240
in the hole when you're trying to debug

863
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
it

864
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,559
so

865
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,880
um

866
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,440
also best way to save money put in a

867
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,880
cost limit make sure that you don't

868
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,559
actually overspend what you've got in

869
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,600
place

870
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,880
um oh that's another thing try and reuse

871
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,120
a lot of assets so for example let's say

872
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,480
you've got three different challenges

873
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,720
that are forensics you've got one which

874
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,640
is all right here's a disk image and i

875
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,799
need you to find the flag you can then

876
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,480
say alright challenge2

877
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
same disk image but the flag is in a

878
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,000
different location and then same thing

879
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,320
for three so it's the same file and it

880
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,520
means that you don't have to upload

881
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,200
three different

882
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,320
files to cover three different

883
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,440
challenges and it just kind of brings

884
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,640
things down a little bit try and think

885
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,600
about

886
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
more offline based challenges like

887
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,080
cryptography forensics ocean that kind

888
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,159
of stuff even just like virtual machines

889
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,520
that you ask the user to download it

890
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
they get a container that they can run

891
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,120
on their own machine that's a great way

892
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
for you to not have to host it yourself

893
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,840
and you can keep the challenges there

894
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,559
uh troy hunt has a great blog post about

895
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,000
how he racked up

896
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,799
10 000 australian dollars because he

897
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,480
didn't properly set up cost limits or

898
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,520
alerts

899
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,600
and he just had to pay it because i mean

900
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,880
i mean to be honest he probably spends

901
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
about half the time anyway

902
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,279
but

903
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,799
um

904
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,279
yeah so on the topic of storage here's a

905
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,520
quick comparison of the different

906
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,919
services that are available in cloud so

907
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,039
the main ones

908
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,200
you've got at the bottom like amazon

909
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,240
azure google google is by far the most

910
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
expensive but kind of go with what you

911
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,200
know so if you've got experience with

912
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,399
aws

913
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,200
technically azure is slightly cheaper

914
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,880
but at the same time

915
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,520
if you're well versed in one

916
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,120
it's probably easier just to deal with

917
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,240
that especially if you're the only one

918
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
who's dealing with this or managing it

919
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,320
likewise you can technically

920
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,200
use dropbox watch out for dropbox basics

921
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,880
specifically because they have limits

922
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,320
onto how many

923
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,000
downloads a particular file is there how

924
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,840
much actual space you've got 20 gigs

925
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,760
goes very quickly

926
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,320
but interestingly enough if you've got

927
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,399
any of the paid tiers plus family

928
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,480
professional and so on it's only a 10 or

929
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,360
a month

930
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,799
and

931
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,799
you basically have

932
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,039
unlimited downloads there's no cap as to

933
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,480
where they're coming from or anything

934
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,240
else like that so if you've got that

935
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
service exact already

936
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,760
you know use it it's great

937
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,600
um the best value spend that i have now

938
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,200
saving money is one thing but the best

939
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,480
value in this

940
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,600
i would say is cloud support and there's

941
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,039
different tiers depending which provider

942
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,120
you've got but at the end of the day

943
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,960
you've got like you know your basic one

944
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,159
you've got your enterprise and then

945
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,480
you've got your really enterprise

946
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,919
the the different contracts that are

947
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,320
available basically boils down to your

948
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,600
um

949
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,279
slas and how quickly they'll get back to

950
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,080
you but it's always a good thing to have

951
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,360
especially when you're running an event

952
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,039
for the first time

953
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,720
if something breaks you've got someone

954
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,399
you can call they will turn around

955
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,919
within like

956
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,200
an hour or something like that and say

957
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
okay cool we figured out why your your

958
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
system didn't work

959
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,279
and you just need to change this config

960
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,559
and that's fine

961
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,200
so this is a great spend if you can

962
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,559
because on the day

963
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,840
everything's really hectic you're going

964
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,360
to be trying to troubleshoot things you

965
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,919
run around like a headless chicken

966
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,840
um last thing i want to talk about is

967
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
some extra tools that are in there so

968
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,640
secgen and juice shop are great tools

969
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,240
kind of spin up content very quickly

970
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,919
especially with secgen

971
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,000
you dynamically create challenges kind

972
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,840
of like the pico ctf stuff where it

973
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,159
dynamically changes flags and so on

974
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,360
if you just want to play around with a

975
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,519
platform or run something for maybe a

976
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,120
you know your local hacking club or

977
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,799
something like that these are great ways

978
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,240
to get familiar not only with the

979
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,039
existing stuff that you can model after

980
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,080
but

981
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,679
get your infrastructure in place and and

982
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,000
get some experience with it

983
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,679
the last thing that's right

984
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,519
i said the last thing but other things

985
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,159
to watch out for is when you do host

986
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,440
your services

987
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,120
make sure that um cloud secops knows for

988
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,240
example with aws you need to tell them

989
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,480
at least a week in advance hey i've got

990
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,320
this

991
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,919
hacking platform this competition that's

992
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,760
going on if you see malicious traffic

993
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
going to these ip addresses

994
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,960
don't worry about it it's fine it's

995
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,399
legit we're keeping an eye out that's

996
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,600
fine

997
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,360
at the same time

998
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,200
they'll know hey there's a whole lot of

999
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,799
traffic going on here we noticed that

1000
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,640
there's a whole lot of denial service

1001
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
traffic that's getting hit

1002
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,159
is this you and you can say nope that's

1003
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,640
not us cool they will mitigate it away

1004
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,159
the cost but it's there

1005
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,960
likewise keep an eye on your backups

1006
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,880
nothing worse than uh trying to restore

1007
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,200
backup mid competition going oh

1008
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,919
it doesn't work not me thankfully but

1009
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,559
this thing to keep an eye on um

1010
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,320
what i'd say is then the last thing is

1011
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,480
if you want to try and encourage players

1012
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,080
to let you know about any infrastructure

1013
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,039
things

1014
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,039
um introduce some kind of a bug bounty

1015
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,440
program just something simple that says

1016
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,480
hey

1017
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
you've got a problem with your website i

1018
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,279
found out that i can

1019
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,720
no one's going to burn a zero day on a

1020
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,799
ctf let's be honest but

1021
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,640
if there's a bug or something like that

1022
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,000
let them know just give them some extra

1023
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
points uh something token something that

1024
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,200
you know just rewards them it's good

1025
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,039
so now

1026
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,279
you've got your infrastructure sorted

1027
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,279
let's talk about logistics so this is

1028
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,960
basically just kind of tying up all the

1029
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,799
small bits and bots to do the actual

1030
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,519
competition so first of all

1031
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,960
start early

1032
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,039
planning takes an awful lot of time

1033
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,279
right infosec is full of people with

1034
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,279
terrible time management skills

1035
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,919
and we cannot estimate very well

1036
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,840
so keep in mind you're going to need

1037
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,000
some extra time things will break plan

1038
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,919
for ups

1039
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,159
um try not to have a single point of

1040
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,320
failure especially with access you know

1041
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,919
do things like separate your accounts

1042
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,919
just for the event that way if something

1043
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,720
happens someone else can take over

1044
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,039
um

1045
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,919
yeah there we go

1046
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,519
as you can see dark tangent here of jeff

1047
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,840
moss says that planning starts as soon

1048
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,519
as we finish defcon i mean he's right i

1049
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,559
mean if you look at the defcon

1050
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,919
documentary

1051
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,679
they're going they're finishing up they

1052
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,799
might take a break of a couple of weeks

1053
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,080
but then they're straight back into it

1054
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,919
and it's just because it is massive it's

1055
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,840
the same thing for some of your

1056
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,440
competition are we on time okay

1057
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,679
so

1058
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,159
yeah

1059
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,159
um technically this is a little bit more

1060
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,159
scopes but stuff but try and figure out

1061
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,839
your time and again who your target

1062
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,560
audience is if you are making a global

1063
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,679
event

1064
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,159
um some of the biggest industry

1065
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,960
uh users out there are

1066
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,440
often not always

1067
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,560
in the uk the us germany europe that

1068
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,760
kind of stuff

1069
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,520
and if you can try and figure out where

1070
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,000
your competition is best to overlap in

1071
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
those time zones it makes things a bit

1072
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,679
easier but it also is consideration for

1073
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,399
your infrastructure for so for example

1074
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,960
you got here on london if you kick off

1075
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,879
at about one o'clock

1076
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,000
that's 8 a.m or 5 a.m for folks in the

1077
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,040
us not ideal but then if

1078
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,359
they're finishing up at like lunch time

1079
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,400
or something like that and then suddenly

1080
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
you see a large amount of traffic coming

1081
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
in and like okay cool the us crowd have

1082
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,400
woken up

1083
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,040
and try and introduce

1084
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,480
some mandatory breaks if you can

1085
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,079
especially if this is something on-prem

1086
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,599
a lot of folks get like tunnel vision

1087
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,640
when they're working on this and that's

1088
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,560
kind of a blessing in disguise

1089
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,400
and forces them to you know take breaks

1090
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
go to the loo have something to eat

1091
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,599
and

1092
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,880
yeah

1093
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,240
it's funny because a lot of people

1094
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,359
forget to eat when they're focused on

1095
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,800
this kind of stuff but they need it so

1096
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,440
that they don't get burned out

1097
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,920
so let's look at some of the marketing

1098
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,359
that you need to look at so the best

1099
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,119
thing that you can do

1100
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,200
is again figure out is this a virtual is

1101
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,280
it a physical event

1102
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,720
try and network with different

1103
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,400
communities that are out there

1104
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,200
so

1105
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,280
some of the bigger infosec communities

1106
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,119
that are out on discord for example

1107
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,040
you've got dead pixel sec hack south

1108
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,440
digital overdose funnily enough hacks

1109
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,520
out is a south african discord but

1110
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,160
they're that prevalent and they do so

1111
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
many ctfs and things like that that

1112
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,520
they're just out there they're a great

1113
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,280
community

1114
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,440
but again try networks with some of your

1115
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,320
local stuff so for example if you are in

1116
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,680
uni and

1117
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,520
you know there's a kids hacking club or

1118
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,599
something like that nearby see if you

1119
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,200
can loop them in it's a great way to

1120
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,720
cross advertise some of your different

1121
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,240
events

1122
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,119
and same thing you know use twitter um

1123
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,880
to get your events and things like that

1124
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,720
tweetdeck is a fantastic tool where you

1125
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,839
can queue up a bunch of different tweets

1126
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,960
about you know what's happening and so

1127
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,079
on and you don't have to worry about

1128
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,560
making sure that you're in time

1129
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,240
um

1130
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
so this poster is kind of interesting

1131
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,040
because

1132
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,400
we modeled it after a study by mit

1133
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,520
so

1134
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,480
mit had this thing where it was a simple

1135
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,640
a b test where they said all right we've

1136
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,119
got two different loyalty cards

1137
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,440
one of them has six stamps and you know

1138
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,200
if you go to a coffee shop you get a

1139
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,880
stamp cool

1140
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,680
the other one had eight stamps but two

1141
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,520
of them were filled in already

1142
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,599
and after a quick you know a b test to

1143
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,200
see which one was more affected they

1144
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,359
found out that the eight stamps that had

1145
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,760
the two extra spaces there

1146
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,200
were a great way to get more people

1147
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,800
interested so this is kind of the same

1148
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,560
thing with what we did with our posters

1149
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,400
so we tried to say

1150
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,160
hey look you've got a head start you've

1151
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,839
got 100 points just by seeing this

1152
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,160
poster you know grab one of these slips

1153
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,280
and so on

1154
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,640
the thing to note with this poster as

1155
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,000
well is that we wanted to try and make

1156
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,079
it kind of eye-catching from a distance

1157
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,400
this is only meant to be a4 but as you

1158
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
can see like the biggest thing

1159
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,880
takes a path to page and you know that's

1160
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,720
my design

1161
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,240
we ran this at

1162
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,520
emf camp

1163
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,920
and as you can see fairly grand you know

1164
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
lots of people were taking it

1165
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,119
we actually kind of ran into a little

1166
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,560
bit of a bug when we were dealing with

1167
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
it though because it's all well and good

1168
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,040
saying lots of people took these slips

1169
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,240
but we didn't have a huge amount of

1170
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,200
uptake afterwards and it was because

1171
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,760
it's the the text on the bottom

1172
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,320
says golden ticket

1173
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,640
uh one per team great

1174
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,560
but it doesn't say anything about about

1175
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,880
the website on there so you're expected

1176
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,320
to you know take another url or scan the

1177
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,560
qr code or something and then grab it

1178
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,160
but a lot of people would come up to the

1179
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,599
notice board on the way to something

1180
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,760
else grab a slip and be like oh i wonder

1181
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,520
what this is for

1182
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,800
um

1183
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,400
watch out for rain as well especially

1184
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,240
when you put up posters this did not

1185
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,599
last i'm not sure if you can see very

1186
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,680
well but the qr code is absolutely

1187
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,240
banjaxed at the end um and also please

1188
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,920
tell me about your posters this is

1189
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,359
technically litter if you haven't picked

1190
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,960
it up

1191
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,440
so let's talk about

1192
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,760
comms so

1193
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,079
this is kind of your

1194
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,440
let's say you got your event up and

1195
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,200
running how do you actually reach people

1196
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,359
how do people reach you more importantly

1197
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,240
so discord has an announcements channel

1198
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,440
which

1199
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,119
basically is just basically your your

1200
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,800
official announcements about blah blah

1201
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
blah here's the channel and so on an

1202
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,599
interesting

1203
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,680
uh technical note is that other

1204
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,760
communities can subscribe to this so

1205
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,040
again if you've been networking with

1206
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,560
other discords and so on they can

1207
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,400
subscribe to your events

1208
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,480
and use that as a great way to easily

1209
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,960
advertise your stuff

1210
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
you can also utilize lots of different

1211
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,040
bots out there to try and link in

1212
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,560
some of your stuff so that you're not

1213
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,320
running multiple different services once

1214
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,680
so for example if you've got twitter

1215
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,280
you've got discord you've got irc

1216
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,240
whatever

1217
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,000
you can run bots that basically link

1218
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,440
them all together and they just do it

1219
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,599
all at once

1220
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,200
on the day

1221
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,720
make sure you've got a comms area for

1222
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,119
staff so it can be sort of like a green

1223
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,200
room for staff members to hang out and

1224
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,119
do whatever talk about oh hey there's

1225
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,480
you know some infrastructure or whatever

1226
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,160
that's there

1227
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,680
but also try and make sure that there's

1228
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,320
a space available for you

1229
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,359
uh

1230
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,599
sorry to make you available to other

1231
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,640
people so hang out in some chat channel

1232
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,760
or something like that that means that

1233
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,839
people can reach out to you and say hey

1234
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,119
something's going on or i'm having

1235
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,599
difficulty can you let me know it's a

1236
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,119
great way to find out that oh there's

1237
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,400
some kind of

1238
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,160
um technical issue and that's why you're

1239
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,240
not seeing the uptake of the really easy

1240
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,200
challenge that you thought everyone

1241
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,040
would solve

1242
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,520
uh what else we got there also you know

1243
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,680
big emphasis on making sure you've got

1244
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,440
moderators there to keep the peace but

1245
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,200
also just help guide people who might

1246
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,720
need some help

1247
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,240
uh

1248
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,200
okay

1249
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,400
um so quick story time so a couple of

1250
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,200
years ago during 44 con we had an arc

1251
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
which is an alternate reality game

1252
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,359
and what we decided to do is we had

1253
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,800
a bunch of different cash prizes we had

1254
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
ethereum that was available for people

1255
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,440
to

1256
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,040
rob essentially the story was in the

1257
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,720
the arg

1258
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,119
we were launching a new ico it was going

1259
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,280
to be you know a fake pump and dump new

1260
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,000
coin 44 coin great

1261
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,960
everyone has one because they attended

1262
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,839
and you can access that by going into

1263
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,240
our banking system which is great but

1264
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,480
it's only read access so no one's

1265
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,400
actually able to move any of the money

1266
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,920
but they can see it

1267
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,359
now

1268
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,599
we wanted to

1269
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,760
make this a high stakes thing and it was

1270
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,200
also

1271
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,319
it was different from the other

1272
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,440
challenges because only one group or one

1273
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,119
uh individual would be able to take all

1274
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,720
the money and then go it's you know time

1275
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,200
sensitive kind of thing

1276
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
there was about four thousand pounds

1277
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,359
sorry five thousand pounds available for

1278
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,680
grabs and what we did was with this

1279
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,599
banking system we kind of scattered it

1280
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,520
through all the different accounts

1281
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,880
there was a vulnerability in there that

1282
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,240
was privilege escalation that allowed

1283
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
you to then become admin

1284
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,920
iterate through all the money so iterate

1285
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,520
through all the accounts and drain them

1286
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,079
great then you got a bunch of cash

1287
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,839
the problem was

1288
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:38,640
we

1289
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,880
finished up the con and people didn't

1290
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,400
take the money yet they didn't realize

1291
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
what was going on so you know we're

1292
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,640
saying

1293
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,240
hey you know this is going on for a bit

1294
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,800
longer you can keep at it you know drop

1295
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,440
in some heaviest and that kind of stuff

1296
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,079
the problem was one of the teams were

1297
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,200
too good

1298
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,040
and they gone past the solution they

1299
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,720
didn't realize that this is what they

1300
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,560
needed to do they'd gone on a completely

1301
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
separate rabbit hole

1302
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,000
we found out

1303
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,880
um

1304
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,280
after chatting with them at the bar hey

1305
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,480
you know they were trying to fish for

1306
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,400
some hits and things like that

1307
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,839
we realized that they were actually

1308
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,160
hitting a completely separate

1309
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,400
banking service which had nothing to do

1310
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,079
with the game whatsoever even though in

1311
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,480
the rules and so on we outlined guys

1312
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,160
this is a scope don't touch anything

1313
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
else like that but they still thought oh

1314
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,359
my god

1315
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,800
there's five thousand pounds available

1316
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,000
for it

1317
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,680
so we had to reel them back and say no

1318
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,000
no this is where you go ah don't worry

1319
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,119
about that

1320
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,319
um

1321
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,760
yeah funnily enough at the same weekend

1322
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,960
as well ethereum crash so

1323
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,319
um

1324
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,000
branding branding is a little bit tricky

1325
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,440
because

1326
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,280
for myself especially

1327
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,760
usually i'll be part of another event

1328
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,280
and they'll be doing their own branding

1329
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,520
and then this time i'm kind of branding

1330
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,200
as myself so there's not a huge amount

1331
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,440
that i can offer except

1332
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,720
you know

1333
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,880
it's kind of like branding for anything

1334
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,240
if you're trying to get into infosec let

1335
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,160
people know who you are even it's just

1336
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,680
you know being active in the community

1337
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,760
doing posting or whatever

1338
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,880
um

1339
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,079
get a name

1340
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,680
carve a name for yourself out there let

1341
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,680
people know who you are and

1342
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,079
just basically get people to go oh hey

1343
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,920
you're silverfish you did the scavenger

1344
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,440
hunt and blah blah blah actually kind of

1345
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
helpful for myself because still khan

1346
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
was like oh we can't get into data we

1347
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,119
can't get into twitter properly this is

1348
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,240
the guy who did all that kind of stuff

1349
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,440
and a bunch of people were vouching for

1350
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,240
me

1351
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,599
um

1352
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,359
also if you can you know support a local

1353
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,520
artist get them to do the the assets and

1354
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,040
things like that it's very easy and

1355
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,079
usually it's very professional

1356
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,680
tickets this is where you're trying to

1357
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,640
figure out you know what kind of

1358
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,839
platform you're going to be using is it

1359
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,440
going to be eventbrite is it going to be

1360
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,359
like tito like steelcon i'm using right

1361
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,200
now but this also gives you about the

1362
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,640
idea of

1363
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,280
what would you do if suddenly the cost

1364
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,720
or sorry the amount of people who are

1365
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,040
playing skyrockets very suddenly if you

1366
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,119
can figure out your infrastructure

1367
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,520
um per head then that gives you a better

1368
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,800
idea as to how many tickets that you

1369
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,920
need to sell to cover your costs

1370
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,400
also try and figure out your pricing for

1371
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,680
the target audience that you're going

1372
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,880
for is there going to be students

1373
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
professionals and so on if it's cheaper

1374
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,800
or free you know a lot more students are

1375
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,880
going to be playing and

1376
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,960
you know so and so forth also always a

1377
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,160
good idea to include like a little

1378
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,000
donation here just in case people want

1379
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,520
to throw you a couple bob

1380
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,400
so sponsorship if you can't charge

1381
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,160
tickets or you want to get some extra

1382
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,359
cash this is how you get it so

1383
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,200
try and figure out first of all what do

1384
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,880
you need help with are you trying to

1385
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,240
cover infrastructure costs is it

1386
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,839
marketing is it getting people in there

1387
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,280
are you trying to cover volunteer costs

1388
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,800
that kind of stuff

1389
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,200
but also what are you selling so if

1390
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,119
someone sponsors you what do they get in

1391
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,839
return so is it things like

1392
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,599
advertising

1393
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,599
on posters that kind of stuff are you

1394
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,040
trying to get

1395
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,160
um

1396
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,440
maybe mentions when you're addressing

1397
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,200
the audience as you saw in still kind

1398
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,960
you know they had

1399
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,800
you know thank you very much for blah

1400
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,880
blah blah

1401
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,800
here's an extra slide at the beginning

1402
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,319
all the the leaflets and things like

1403
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,160
that the company name

1404
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,599
basically gets plastered everywhere and

1405
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,200
that's what you're trying to sell but

1406
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,560
it's also a question of how much does

1407
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,599
that cost is it a simple case of okay

1408
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,839
um if you want to do a branding package

1409
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,440
this will get you you know advertising

1410
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,960
on the side in the leaflets that kind of

1411
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,839
stuff but it'll cost you 200 pounds

1412
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,000
and you can see here this is what i did

1413
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,079
for emf cam now

1414
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,599
don't worry about the zeros that are

1415
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,520
there i assure you i did get paid for

1416
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,800
some stuff but

1417
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,160
um

1418
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,760
when you're using

1419
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,839
uh

1420
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,240
when you're using eventbrite

1421
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,839
or any of these other ticketing systems

1422
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,599
you basically use them as sort of like a

1423
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,680
payment processing system so then that

1424
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,960
means you can kind of tweak it a little

1425
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,599
bit to try and get

1426
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,160
sponsors to use that and not have to ask

1427
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,760
for bank details or anything else like

1428
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,359
that and they can just basically go

1429
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,680
click add to cart sponsorship is on the

1430
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,400
way

1431
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,480
right so when you're trying to reach out

1432
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,079
to different people make sure you've got

1433
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,640
a cover letter in place so if you're

1434
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,880
doing like a cold call or anything else

1435
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,400
like that you don't quite know anyone or

1436
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,640
you haven't networked enough a great way

1437
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,960
is to try and contact maybe the press at

1438
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,040
addresses or things like that

1439
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,599
and just tell them hey look this is me

1440
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,359
i'm trying to do this thing

1441
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,640
you know why is it interesting and so on

1442
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,640
trying to have a financial plan a plan

1443
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,040
in place as well as a way to justify

1444
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,480
your budget so if you don't know exactly

1445
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,920
how much you need

1446
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,680
this is a great way to figure it out but

1447
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,760
also gives you backup plans in case you

1448
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,720
find out that you don't have enough

1449
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,640
money to cover all of your costs so

1450
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,599
reduce the number of volunteers maybe or

1451
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,200
number of prizes that are available that

1452
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,759
kind of stuff

1453
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,040
so

1454
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,119
on the topic of cover letters

1455
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,480
uh

1456
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,079
when i was doing

1457
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,079
emf camp i was trying to reach out to a

1458
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:54,960
couple of different names in the

1459
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,359
industry one of them is three letters

1460
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,599
i'll let you figure that out but i do

1461
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,640
this thing where i'm kind of like

1462
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,880
brainstorming in my dress right so

1463
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,920
figuring out a couple of different

1464
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,040
things

1465
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,880
everything was fine i did a quick skim

1466
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,400
of the email

1467
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,520
and

1468
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,920
then it sets it off great not a problem

1469
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,599
about a week goes by

1470
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,800
and i'm like i haven't heard anything

1471
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,160
what's going on

1472
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,079
when i originally tried to find out the

1473
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,319
best address to send this to

1474
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,680
people were saying okay well you need to

1475
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,720
send it to the support at email address

1476
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,760
and

1477
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,200
when i did that i got a little error

1478
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,880
responder that said cool we got your

1479
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,960
ticket not a problem awesome okay

1480
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,680
then i go into my drafts and i'm like oh

1481
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,119
god

1482
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,040
i find out that what i'd actually sent

1483
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,920
was

1484
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,760
a half written draft where i was trying

1485
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,240
to brainstorm some stuff to figure out

1486
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,160
how to actually reach them and of course

1487
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,559
the best thing i did was i said hi there

1488
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,040
my name is james bond hello

1489
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,880
this is not

1490
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,720
the best thing to do but it gets kind of

1491
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,000
worse

1492
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,440
when i actually went through here i'm

1493
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,599
like okay cool we've got you know ctf

1494
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,599
we're doing it for emf cam

1495
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,440
this i'm okay with that was you know

1496
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,920
semi polished all great so far mostly

1497
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,119
legit

1498
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,119
the next thing i'm like okay i need to

1499
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,640
figure out how to sell this why are they

1500
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,760
interested that kind of stuff

1501
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,079
everybody loves hackers everyone's kids

1502
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,520
how would we you know marry this

1503
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,040
together how do we make it interesting

1504
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,000
for maybe some family folks and so on

1505
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,960
and then

1506
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,200
why am i so special what makes me so

1507
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
great that i should actually ask for

1508
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,359
sponsorship and also spell charity

1509
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,960
completely incorrectly

1510
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,520
and of course when i did this it signed

1511
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,000
off with my signature just saying ha

1512
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,240
cheers james

1513
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,400
needless to say i did not get a response

1514
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,559
for that

1515
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,559
um but let's move on to some of the

1516
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,160
prizes so

1517
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,240
the different prizes that you can offer

1518
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,480
obviously is you know you can offer cash

1519
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,119
from a prize pool or you can say

1520
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,960
um let's buy some stuff

1521
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,319
if you are

1522
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,640
a non-profit or something like that you

1523
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,240
can try and reach out to different

1524
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,720
groups who sometimes offer discounts for

1525
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,480
individual

1526
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,960
groups or communities so for example

1527
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,280
women tech bay and lgbt plus that kind

1528
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,480
of stuff

1529
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,720
if you are in contact with your sponsor

1530
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,040
they may be able to donate

1531
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,040
some products or some time and

1532
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,559
infrastructure that kind of stuff as a

1533
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,520
way to

1534
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,760
you know add to your prize pool

1535
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,079
you can also depending on your event

1536
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,079
offer free entry use black badges and

1537
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,920
things like that to try and get people

1538
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,200
to come back

1539
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,960
um but then there's also some other

1540
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,440
stuff like vanity roles on a discord

1541
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,880
server or whatever if you're just in a

1542
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,880
hacker club then that's a great way to

1543
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,520
say you know it's a limited time role i

1544
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,440
participated great same thing with

1545
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,119
badger you know it's kind of the same

1546
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,880
way but kind of a wider audience

1547
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,760
um

1548
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,920
also consider legal so these are you

1549
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,760
know some of the

1550
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,440
a bit of the boring bits that come up

1551
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,520
but things like look at your ctf rules

1552
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,359
so these clearly define you know what's

1553
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,400
in scope

1554
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,760
where everything is everything's under

1555
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,680
you know xyz domain

1556
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,200
you can attack everything that's there

1557
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,440
but only what's in there

1558
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,680
also try to include a code of conduct so

1559
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,960
this is just you know behavioral

1560
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,480
standards make sure that people aren't a

1561
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,880
dick and that kind of thing but also it

1562
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,119
includes ways for people to report an

1563
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,440
incident and then it outlines what

1564
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,680
happens when you actually do get an

1565
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,760
incident do you say all right well if

1566
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,800
you are

1567
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,040
being a bit of a we may ban you

1568
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,640
from our events we may include the

1569
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,319
police but it gives people that kind of

1570
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,680
assurance

1571
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,400
likewise if you're doing a physical

1572
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,160
uh event you know include the covert

1573
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,960
policy a lot of venues will have their

1574
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,079
own covert policies that you can

1575
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,400
basically just bring in there or link to

1576
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,160
then you've got your privacy policy

1577
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,040
which is just like gdpr your cookies

1578
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,559
what you use the data for who's your

1579
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,680
data protection officer how to uh get a

1580
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,079
sorry how to serve a subject access

1581
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,240
request or if someone wants to delete

1582
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,319
their data but also outline how long you

1583
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,400
keep the data for

1584
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,280
so

1585
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,760
in summary just to wrap up

1586
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,920
best way to save money keep your scope

1587
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,000
easy if you start changing things it's

1588
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,599
not the end of the world but you risk

1589
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,200
adding more costs on there

1590
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,280
good design isn't always apparent and is

1591
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,319
usually invisible but bad ones stick out

1592
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,400
cloud costs a lot but it's a very

1593
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,240
powerful tool be aware that you might

1594
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,480
need to eat those costs and then

1595
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,160
logistics kind of puts things together

1596
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,440
but a lot of different balls to juggle

1597
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,119
the only other thing i'd say is some

1598
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,319
extra stuff that you might want to take

1599
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,760
a look at is

1600
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,839
these are some

1601
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,640
blogs papers resources and so on the

1602
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,559
play parliament pawning for example have

1603
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,240
a great one on there that basically kind

1604
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,440
of covers some of the stuff that i

1605
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,960
pulled from here

1606
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,920
um

1607
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,720
the many maxims of maximally effective

1608
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,599
ctfs unfortunately was on a great blog

1609
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,520
but isn't available anymore so i had to

1610
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,000
use web archive to pick it up

1611
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,520
um

1612
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,839
yeah and that's me is there any

1613
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,160
questions

1614
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,240
yes

1615
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,760
talk about using cloud for this which

1616
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,559
sounds like a great plan um

1617
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,680
here

1618
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,200
um

1619
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,640
is anybody

1620
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,960
supplying things like infrastructure as

1621
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,240
code to like terror

1622
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,839
so you can repeatedly stand up the

1623
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,760
infrastructure pulling

1624
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,960
uh artifacts from s3 buckets um

1625
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,440
that way you know you can size it okay

1626
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,240
this code will work for 200 people this

1627
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,839
will do for a thousand

1628
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,400
because it's a known quantity upfront

1629
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,960
you can predict the cost

1630
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,640
is anybody doing that kind of model or

1631
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,800
is it

1632
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,960
um yeah so

1633
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,400
your question is basically is anyone

1634
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,000
offering ctf as a service basically

1635
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,319
or the mechanism to do it yourself yeah

1636
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:49,680
install unknown

1637
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,720
structures

1638
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,400
um well it's kind of a double-edged

1639
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,440
sword so i like using ctfd because of

1640
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,880
how mature it is and there's a lot of

1641
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
thought that's gone into it

1642
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,559
and they offer you know ways that you

1643
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,800
can just spin up an instance in docker

1644
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,000
but you kind of have to tweak it a

1645
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,359
little bit of self desire you have to

1646
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:06,960
tweak it yourself in order to get a

1647
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,359
production ready and

1648
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,280
the reason is because they have their

1649
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,880
own servers that they basically provide

1650
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,960
and say all right if you want a ctfd

1651
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,640
instance with a handful of challenges

1652
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,920
and that kind of stuff

1653
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,520
all you got to do is paste 50 quid a

1654
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,720
month and it's a great way for people

1655
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,160
trying to get into

1656
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,760
ctfs without having to worry about

1657
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,839
infrastructure maybe it's a small team

1658
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,119
college hacking community that kind of

1659
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,720
stuff and they just want something that

1660
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,839
goes

1661
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,119
now

1662
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,359
that's the big stuff a lot of the things

1663
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,240
that i've mentioned are open source

1664
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,040
and they do use containers and so on to

1665
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,119
try and make it easy to bring up but

1666
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,119
they don't usually say all right here's

1667
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,480
how you connect up um to s3 or so there

1668
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,559
is some documentation don't get me wrong

1669
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,200
but it's not as click to run as you

1670
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,559
might expect

1671
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,079
usually they offer that kind of service

1672
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,839
because at the end of the day they put a

1673
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,200
lot of effort into this to make sure

1674
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,440
that it goes well and

1675
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,040
they just want to offer a service

1676
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,720
themselves and interestingly because the

1677
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,760
utc leads have asked the producers

1678
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,119
and the various cyber

1679
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,079
hey can we do that too

1680
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,000
and if you've got something they can run

1681
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,480
themselves very quickly and easily

1682
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,240
yeah

1683
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,079
i mean it this is the thing with these

1684
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,680
kind of services right especially when

1685
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,839
you've got um a paid service you've got

1686
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,079
an sla that comes with it it's like they

1687
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,440
can take care of all the things like

1688
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,599
making sure that everything's got uptime

1689
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,440
the data you basically just have a bill

1690
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,799
at the end you don't have to worry about

1691
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,880
you know making sure that you don't

1692
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,119
properly provision or cost budget things

1693
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,680
like that um so it's a trade-off i mean

1694
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,280
with any service it's like saying okay

1695
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,079
well do i want to have you know a local

1696
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,319
active directory server which does all

1697
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,440
that kind of stuff you have to provide

1698
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,040
the hardware the certain licensing that

1699
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,640
you have to deal with and so on usually

1700
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,960
an on-premises admin or maybe an msp

1701
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,880
that takes care of it or

1702
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,359
you can get office 365 and you know it's

1703
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,520
a flat rate you know per user hosting

1704
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,599
that kind of stuff and

1705
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,559
it's a trade-off that's all

1706
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,640
right

1707
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,359
any other questions

1708
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,680
so you mentioned before that obviously

1709
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,520
you need this kind of stuff in aws or

1710
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,799
issue a awesome cloud either that the

1711
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,119
majority of them have security policies

1712
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,880
in places like

1713
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,359
ddos attacks and things like that

1714
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,240
have you ever seen any examples where

1715
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,880
they've actually had to auto scale the

1716
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,000
actual underlying infrastructure because

1717
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,280
there's been

1718
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,359
a bit of a dos attempt

1719
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,839
or something like that because aws do

1720
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,000
that automatically and you broke the

1721
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,880
cost of that yes uh i can speak from

1722
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,680
first-hand experience so um a couple

1723
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,760
years ago for 44 con

1724
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,119
we set everything up it was a very

1725
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,160
standard very easy

1726
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,640
infrastructure basically using ctfd and

1727
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,839
so on and

1728
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,119
uh we had an issue where

1729
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,680
at some point there was

1730
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,040
i don't know why but there was basically

1731
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,079
some kind of crawler or something like

1732
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,440
that that started hitting the

1733
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,599
infrastructure and of course all these

1734
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,040
different requests that weren't going

1735
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,720
through properly it's like oh we gotta

1736
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,799
scale stuff up eventually we found out

1737
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,400
what the issue was and we were able to

1738
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,319
contact amazon who were able to sink all

1739
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,400
the offending ib addresses and then we

1740
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,480
put in some extra stuff to try and

1741
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,160
stagger those requests like cloudflare

1742
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,920
captures that kind of thing

1743
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,280
so that was fine

1744
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,280
until afterwards when we find out that

1745
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,880
we racked up about a thousand pounds

1746
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,079
worth of bill

1747
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,720
for just ec2 instances alone so that

1748
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,520
wasn't fun um but again

1749
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,200
this is why you want to try and have

1750
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,799
those guys on hand so that if something

1751
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,240
happens you can just go

1752
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,599
please take care of it i'm paying you to

1753
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,040
do this

1754
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,359
um

1755
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,960
yeah yeah that's basically it

1756
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,240
cool

1757
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,720
anything else

1758
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,840
no okay

1759
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,419
[Applause]
